      <DefaultText>A tubular, metal device. Cold in your hands. A switch activates some internal energy source, and when activated the device gains a curious weight and inertia that shifts over time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A small, fine blade of transdimensional energy extends from a hilt of azure steel. With a twist of the hand, it can quickly be switched on and off. This scalpel cuts through dimensions, rapidly shimmering between different realities and ignoring most mundane armors. Inscribed into the hilt is the name 'IOXU.'</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>Made from opaque, battered metal, this jar looks like a repurposed cylinder. Just above its surface, a control panel is projected into the air, displaying enigmatic diagrams and text that indicate the status of its contents. The jar thrums with energy, seeming almost alive. According to Skoura, the nano who gave you this jar, it contains a small part of the Iron Wind - dangerous nano-spirits that warp and transform any matter they touch.</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>You recovered this small canister from the crashed catena. It is made of smooth synth and is icy cold to the touch. On one end of the device is a valve that can be opened to release the coolant in an icy blast, freezing anything it touches. This improvised use would only be effective once.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Shins are usually metal but can be made of glass, plastic, or substances that have no name. Some are jagged bits of interesting material or small, coinlike objects (such as highly decorative buttons from a machine), while others are properly minted and stamped, with writing and images.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Obervich plucked this eye from the multitude of eyes on his head and gave it to you so that you might restore sight to Skoura. He promises it will work simply by placing it on her face. The artificial eye is so well-constructed that it could pass as a real eye on cursory inspection.</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>This is an old, dusty, transparent glass bottle. The cork and the seal remain intact. Foul-smelling liquor inside makes the hairs on your neck stand up. Once ingested, it warms the body and makes the blood boil with rage. The mere smell of it makes you eager to fight. A tiny label on the bottle reads, "No one can tell you what to do and nothing can stand in your way."</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>Sheen vomited this thin, yellow gruel into a small bottle and gave it to you. It is the essence of Artaglio, distilled from a lock of his hair. If you drink it while confronting the Maw in Chiurgeon Slump, it should be enough to convince the Maw that you are Artaglio, so that the Maw will consume you in his place.</DefaultText>

      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>You retrieved this tiny, metal-and-synth sphere from inside a larger device. It is the navigational cortex of the lascars' anchorage, containing records of innumerable worlds and maps of the travel routes between them. You can see infinitesimally small patterns traced along its surface, with miniscule lights racing along and through those patterns.</DefaultText>

      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>This flask contains a yellowish fluid you collected from a 'well' in the Bloom. It has a greasy texture and a faintly sour odor. When you take a sniff, you can hear the whispering voices of the Bloom in your mind.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>The skin of this bloated worm is continually shifting from one material to another - silvery metal to pliable synth to leathery scales to other materials that you can't identify. It seems to be drawn to your exposed flesh, and it will fasten itself to your arm or leg if you allow it to do so. This would cause your skin to take on the same shifting properties as the worm, which will provide you with some additional protection. However, symbiotes like this creature rarely live for long, so the effect will be short-lived.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>This ancient key is fashioned of synthsteel, with a number of free-sliding blocks and spirals that move of their own volition. It is probably capable of opening one or more doors in the Old Slave Block. You acquired the key from the murden chief, but it almost certainly dates from a time long before the murdens took residence in the Slave Block.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The encrusted filth of the Bloom covers this helm's surfaces, inside and out. It looks like it would fit a human head, but the technology that created the helm is far beyond the capabilities of anyone in the Ninth World.

      <DefaultText>Made from some type of synth material, this rope is 15 meters in length and looks sturdy and strong. As you hold it, it squirms gently in your hands, trying to wrap itself around your wrists. It appears to possess a rudimentary form of intelligence, perhaps even sentience. It can tie and untie itself on command.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This many-pointed star has a shimmering, bluish surface, highly polished to touch and sight. Though it appears at first glance to be crystal, it actually has a very fine mechanical structure. On the slightest impact, even a light tap of a finger, it shatters into many pieces and then immediately reforms.</DefaultText>

      <ID>232</ID>
      <DefaultText>This hibernating fleshy worm has a disturbingly human face. Even holding it gives you a feeling of unease and weakness. Whispering a word to the worm will cause it to awaken. It can then be thrown at a living being, and it will attach itself to their flesh, releasing toxins into their bloodstream. These toxins cause instantaneous and powerful hallucinations, real enough to feel like memories to the victim. The hallucinations spin a tale of weakness, vivid enough to translate into actual vulnerability.  [Lore: Mystical] The Call of the Inevitable were once a more common species, used by soothsayers and shamans in their rituals. As time passed, they were increasingly used as part of elaborate hoaxes until people discovered the truth and attempted to eradicate every last one of these worms. Very few are left now.  [Lore: Natural Science] The "call" of the worm is part of its procreation process, as its toxins contain tiny eggs that start their lives inside the person's system and are passed out to begin a new lifecycle for the species. Scholars believe the "call" is meant to make the carrier of the eggs more careful and thus more likely to survive.​</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The multi-stage forging of this ring is a metallurgical mystery of yore. The structural integrity of this piecemeal ring seems to be severely compromised, with its layers of imprecisely interlocking plates of different metals, a few of which have accumulated a patina over the eons. Yet the band somehow retains its circular shape, while the notched rim layers may be twisted so that three layers impossibly swivel into merely two. There are no signs of friction or sound when you make any adjustment to these jagged layers, regardless of direction and degree. However, if the rings interlock multi-laterally, it pulls the wearer out of phase with reality, simultaneously pulling an ally from a different dimension to help absorb of an enemy's attacks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This biomechanical device looks like it was cobbled together from the flesh of an alien lifeform and pieces of complex computational machinery. When activated, it scans the mind of the person holding it, using its biomechanical components to translate information tapped from the datasphere and relaying it to an intent listener, providing both knowledge and mental succor. Unfortunately, the heat generated by the machinery will quickly scorch and burn, rendering the device inert.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A skein of alien characters shifts in filigree across the dark, glassy surface of this fist-sized globe. Gazing into it, you feel a cool radiance dancing at the edges of your thoughts. You look away and blink involuntarily as you realize the reflections of other beings appear... and it leaves you strangely cold. When triggered, this device transmits a burst of insight into the weaknesses of those around you before darkening forever.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Abhumans of the Sagus Protectorate - A Study of Savagery\n\n"The creatures known as abhumans are believed to descend from human ancestors, but at some point in their history, they became something else - perhaps through mutation, directed breeding, or accelerated evolution. Unlike mutants, abhumans have rejected their humanity and live as beasts, though some are very clever. Nearly all of them are violent and cruel, preying upon humanity when they can.\n\nHistorically, two species of abhumans have been common in the Sagus Protectorate. The first is the vile murden, hunched and birdlike, with a sharp, dirty beak and a thick down of black feathers. Murdens subsist as thieves and murderers on the fringes of human society, rarely posing an organized threat to a community, but often ambushing lone victims or terrorizing isolated homesteads. They are incapable of speech, but they communicate with one another through a primitive form of telepathy that bleeds into the minds of everyone nearby, which can prove a dangerous distraction. Most of the time, murdens are notorious cowards, preferring to flee if the odds are not clearly in their favor.\n\nThe other abhuman species that once prospered here is the yovok. Short and squat, with jaundiced skin, yovoki hunt and kill for pleasure, and they eat whatever they kill. In the days when slavery was openly practiced in Sagus Cliffs, bands of yovoki were permitted to range across the frontier, raiding autochthonous tribes of humans and mutants and taking captives to be sold in the flesh markets of the Bloom. The vicious yovoki would sometimes rape their captives as well, and stories say that children were sometimes born from these pairings, tainting the bloodlines of certain families. After the rebellion of Chila the Great, slavery was outlawed in Sagus Cliffs, and the yovoki fled the Protectorate. They haven't been seen in centuries, but the people of Sagus still remember them, and any proof of a blood connection to these creatures is enough to destroy a family's reputation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This tiny, ink-black blot is a living creature, made of thick fluid. When applied to skin, it can shape itself into a number of different kinds of black tattoos, shifting easily into complex glyph shapes. When the wearer is asleep, the Dark crawls over the skin, changing into new patterns as it finds a new place on the body to rest. When it has found a suitable spot, its tendrils dig deep into the flesh, providing some form of a restorative boon.\n\nThe exact nature and origin of the Encroaching Darkness is hard to determine. Aeon Priests have debated whether an individual Darkness is in fact one entity or an entire civilization living on another being's skin. The relation of the Darkness to the wearer is meant to be symbiotic, but the symbiosis appears imperfect.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This shapestone object has a small featureless button on it. When pressed, the device sends out psychic interference, blocking visual perception of the holder. Subjects affected by the interference will notice blurred and distorted squares over the user's body and will be unable to see the user at all unless looking directly at the target.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Akin to how a seashell held to one's ear can bring forth the sound of the sea, merely holding this teal bulb-shaped flute device causes one's loose clothing and hair to flow about them as if affected by ocean currents. Upon blowing into the instrument, a violent pulse ripples forth as a swarm of nanites thicken the local atmosphere to a water-like consistency. Shaped by the wielder's will, only those seen as enemies find themselves slowed or otherwise hindered by the viscous air.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This crystal pulses with vibrant energy, softly expanding and contracting as if breathing in and out. A needle protrudes from the crystal's center... If inserted into a vein, the crystal's pulsing energy can be absorbed to increase the user's physical stamina and muscle mass for a short time.\n\nThese crystals are purified from a murky liquid found rarely in the Garravia Sound. Their origin is unknown, and the process to harvest them without destroying the active substance is difficult, but the supply appears plentiful.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This moss-covered pebble looks almost ordinary, and if it were lying on the ground, it would be difficult to spot. But the moss shifts in unexpected ways, and the pebble vibrates as it does. If held against the skin, the moss latches on and is absorbed, providing powerful resuscitating energies. These pebbles are found by diving into the waters around Sagus Cliffs, perhaps grown by an unknown interaction with the surrounding numenera.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A simmering jar made of metallic glass. Inside the jar rests a strange miasma. Its vapors sit crystalline and perfectly still until held. The glass vessel twists and writhes when grasped. When you put your ear to the device and listen closely, sounds of weeping and hysterical laughter rise from within. Warm to the touch, once inhaled the vessel becomes ice cold. The user feels panic, fear, nausea... and then sweet relief, a torrent of emotions akin to getting a full rest.</DefaultText>

While pliable, it's as unbreakable as steel mesh. It can be applied to armor or clothing for added protection, but after some time, the foam will become brittle and flake off.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A face sculpted from a soft grey material gazes through and beyond you from ashen sockets. The mask affixes to your face with an almost lifelike eagerness. It is clammy, moist to the touch. Viewed through its lens, the world takes on a nightmarish aspect. Once-mundane objects twist with strange new angles. Familiar faces, those of your most trusted friends and companions, contort in ways they never should. In the corners of your eyes, misshapen monstrosities lurch and stagger across impossible landscapes. The effects are subtle at first, but the longer you wear the mask, the more horrifying the visions. What enlightenment, or madness, awaits one with the courage to wear it for long enough?</DefaultText>

      <ID>526</ID>
      <DefaultText>This large, unwieldy item does not look like a shield at all but rather a piece of debris. It was once polished to a mirror sheen, though the pocked reflection it offers to the onlooker is distorted. The shiny surface does not reflect the world around it... at least, not exactly.  Instead of conventional insulation, it appears to channel heat and cold into somewhere... else, perhaps the dimension it reflects. Whether this world is inhabited - and how its denizens might react to the shield's presence - is yet to be determined.</DefaultText>

The injury then troubles the victim, perhaps for years, slowing them such that the current attack lands.</DefaultText>

Whenever a foe is cut by the blade, their blood seems to mingle with the liquid and flow down into your hands, invigorating you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sturdy pieces of sleek, polished synth plating are attached to a form-fitting micromesh suit. These ancient materials were carefully combined into an armor that offers superior protection. It is also lighter and less restrictive than it appears.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Micromesh is a net of finely-woven metal, fitted together with extraordinary precision and shaped into a suit that protects the wearer's entire body. The insignificant weight of this armor, as well as the flexibility of the synthetic material, means that it barely inhibits movement. It's highly prized by nanos and jacks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Fashioned from the flesh of the Bloom, this armor is very much alive. It is, perhaps, the elder Sundermun's masterwork. The thick flesh offers excellent physical protection, while its transdimensional nature protects the wearer against more exotic attacks. In the center of the chest is a tiny Maw, though you're not sure where it leads.\n\nThe living flesh is tough and resistant to manipulation, making the armor difficult to put on. However, once it is worn for a time, it shapes itself to your form, becoming as familiar as your own skin. The sensation is comforting, even if the notion is not.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Angule and the Greater Good: The Rise of the Angulan Knights\n\n"Girar, the handsome young human Aeon Priest, whirled around, holding his quarterstaff before him. The mob of disgusting, slobbering, diseased, ignorant mutants and baby-stealing visitants closed like a dripping fist around him and the innocent children he had sworn to protect.\n\n'For Midgard and the future of humanity!' shouted Angule, champion of humans everywhere and the last hope of kindness and decency in the Ninth World. She charged into the clustered hordes of monsters, slashing left and right. The creatures felt no pain for they had no souls.\n\n'I love you!' Girar cried. 'Do you hear me, damn you? I love you, Angule!'\n\n'I am sorry, noble priest,' Angule said, beheading a gibbering freak. 'My heart belongs to my eternal mission.'\n\n'Your mission to secure the future of humanity from the inhuman horrors of the past?'\n\n'That's right,' Angule said. 'Now flee, and take those innocent children with you! I will defend you and the future you represent to the last!'"\n\n(The rest of the page is blotted with a previous reader's tear stains, and completely unreadable.)</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two Weeks and a Day in the Pleasure Wagons of Ossam's Traveling Menagerie and Soaring Circus\n\n"Day 15:\n\nLight.\n\nGreasy, throbbing sunlight. In my eye. Tried to move. Couldn't.\n\nWell, that was it, I reasoned. I wasn't just hung over. I was paralyzed.\n\nBound to happen eventually. Someone must have mistaken me for the lovely contortionist with the unagran tattoo, and twisted me like a length of rope to get at my tender parts.\n\nWhich, of course, I *did* appreciate. Even now.\n\nI cleared my throat to call politely for help, and a husky voice mumbled something obscene (and somewhat half-hearted - it was dawn, after all) in my right ear. A bare hip settled comfortably into the palm of my left hand as another of my nameless companions got comfortable.\n\nAnd then, of course, I realized the truth - I was not paralyzed. My limbs were merely pinned by the thirty or so strangers sharing the small bed with me.\n\nWhat a relief."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Humming and Hiding - The Secrets of the Labyrinth of Sound\n\n"I will not tell you *why* I found myself lost within the crumbling tower of Kasmus Gol. Nor will I speak on the state I found myself in, or who was with me. Promises were made in the spiraling depths of the Labyrinth of Sound. Promises I intend to keep.\n\nInstead, I will tell you of my escape from that echoing prison. 'But Krasha,' you might say. 'I know enough of the Labyrinth to say that it is but a dark room, navigated by music rather than crude movement. Furthermore, it is deserted! One will not, for example, stumble over bands of thieving murden there, as you did in your thrilling account of "The Crossing of Deep Vormask."'\n\nTo this, I respectfully ask you to close this book and explore the Labyrinth on your own, bereft of my guidance. You will find the melody-scarred bones of my friends still cooling there. You will stumble over grotesque evidence of the choices I made to escape those lightless halls. And you will see how far your rudimentary knowledge will take you.\n\nOtherwise, remain silent, and read on."</DefaultText>

Each ruler of Malevich in recorded history has become obsessed with the chasm in one form or another - some have sought to cross or bridge it (with the lofty goal of conquering the neighboring empire). Others have tried to reach the bottom of the glowing wound. All have failed, to various catastrophic degrees."</DefaultText>

They finally uncovered a treasure trove of numenera, but one particular artifact, a dangerous weapon bright with power, caught both their eyes. They agreed to flip an old coin for it, a lucky token of the jack's, but as he flipped it in the air, the glaive grabbed the item and fired it at the jack. Later, the rest of their companions caught up with them, finding only two corpses and the coin, still spinning in the air, flying from one treasure to another. They decided to take the coin but left the rest... including the corpses.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mask's face is very similar to that of the mechanical men known as Oorgolian soldiers, who patrol isolated areas of the Ninth World. Their motives are entirely unpredictable, and they are generally viewed as a threat by those who live in the Beyond. Some believe that Oorgolian soldiers are following orders that are millions of years old, and a few tribes in the Beyond venerate the creatures as servants of long-dead gods.</DefaultText>

The mottled dun fabric is stiff and resists gentle pressure, like leather soaked and dried too many times. They are not designed for human hands, and the cloth constricts uncomfortably on your hands.\n\nThe gloves undergo a startling change when they touch soil. The cloth instantly flows and ripples with interweaving patterns of color, and the surface erupts with complex textures: stippled, dimpled, or occasionally sculpted into stark three-dimensional arrangements. When withdrawn from contact with the soil, the gloves retain their new pattern for a few minutes before returning to their original dull, smooth form. Upon touching the same sample again, they promptly assume the same configuration as before, but in contact with a different sample, they shift into a new and unique shape and set of vivid patterns. You do not know what the patterns could mean.</DefaultText>

A number of these spheres have since been discovered in different places, usually in caches of similar items. The small, jet-black sphere - made of unknown material - hovers above one's hand. Some reports say that it sometimes randomly changes shape. Its surface has no opening, not even a single scratch or mark. One can feel a slight vibration from the sphere while it hovers, though some hear a humming that is not entirely pleasant, as if its darkness draws the light from the world. The item is rumored to have a beneficial effect on the user, but this may be just wishful thinking. When put away, the sphere stops all activity, as if it can feel the vicinity of living tissue.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This small, carved statue of an unfamiliar rodent appears to be shaped from an unusually dense wood. After holding it in your hand, the individual hairs of the rodent's fur begin to soften. The longer the rodent rests in your hand, the more deeply you feel a sense of calm and warmth. This sensation is in no way mitigated by the fact that periodically the rodent turns its head, smiles at you, and then winks.</DefaultText>

Certain - but not all - liquids poured into this cup will be heated to a boiling point immediately. There's no apparent pattern in what liquids it will or will not heat up, but it seems to activate specifically with synthetic liquids.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This odd pair of gloves, made out of a thick brown leather-like material, feels comfortable and springy. Half-icosahedral metallic studs are mounted on the knuckles. Very shiny and perfectly smooth, they appear to be made out of chromium and feel lukewarm to the touch under any conditions.\n\nWhen worn, the gloves quickly become a burden. The studs begin to make a faint buzzing sound. The longer the gloves are worn, the louder the buzz. After a few minutes, a pronounced fatigue sets in. The fatigue progresses until the wearer feels the same sort of numb sensation in their digits that one would have after wood carving or playing a string instrument for hours. They are impossible to wear comfortably after this point.\n\nTucked into one of gloves when you found them is a piece of paper. On it is a crude picture of the gloves, with various glyphs pointing to specific parts of the apparel. While fascinating, the glyphs do not indicate the gloves' purpose.</DefaultText>

From a distance, this twitch can easily be mistaken for a disarming and somewhat trustworthy grin. The perfume is pleasant from a comfortable distance, and acts as a very mild intoxicant. It causes the user to seem more approachable and honest than they normally would. Charmpaste eventually evaporates, leaving behind a pink, chalky residue. Its effects are limited and tend not to last not much longer than a first impression.</DefaultText>

It clings to your touch, and when you pull away, you notice a drop of blood on your fingertip. You suspect it might be unwise to stay in contact with the object for too long.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A shifting substance fills this ordinary glass vial, existing in many states at the same time. Sometimes, it is a blue liquid or a lump of solid black before subtly becoming purple electrified plasma or a pure white gas. Every phase is so quick, so short, it is impossible to be sure if the change is real, if the substance exists in every state at once, or if it even exists at all. There is a small inscription around the edges of the vial's cork, the letters fading in and out of view as if engraved using a similar substance. It probably, possibly, maybe spells out "Blood of the Elements." One can only wonder what would happen if someone were to consume a substance such as this.</DefaultText>

It warps light around the wearer's body in such a way that things behind him can be seen. The effect is not flawless, often leaving a visible silhouette similar to heat haze, but in certain environments it can help him to hide in plain sight - especially if he remains motionless.\n\nDespite its advantages, the suit is not perfect. When the wearer moves, he creates a bubble or blur in the air that may be quite noticeable.</DefaultText>

The liquid seems to gently slosh as if it had a will of its own. When placed against skin, the metal grows warm and sizzles gently until it becomes fused, though it causes no damage. It can easily be peeled off without leaving more than a mild blister.\n\nWhile bonded with the pendant, the wearer feels a sensation of contentment, tinged with childlike wonder and confusion at the shape and nature of the world. The item seems to hold some manner of charge - one that slowly builds through the tick of time and ages.</DefaultText>

It rests easily in the palm of your hand, but if pressed against the skin, it begins to sink into you, tingling warmly. The sensation is accompanied by a vague feeling of comfort and safety. If absorbed into the body, the soothing dark grants a fleeting moment of seeming immortality, allowing one to brush off grievous wounds. The rush of confidence and elation that accompanies this leaves as abruptly as the regenerative effect itself, replaced with a suddenly enhanced sense of mortality.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This small handheld device is a cylinder about the size of a pen and made of a smooth, unfamiliar material. It is covered in snakelike coils of thick cable. By pointing the cylinder at a living target and pressing a small button on its base, the user can bathe the target in greenish light. This leaves it disoriented and reduces its muscular flexibility for a time. However, the light also causes disjointed and disturbing images to flash through the mind of the user, possibly distracting her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This small pyramidal object was found near the Oasis of M'ra Jolios by a traveler who stumbled upon a particularly unexplainable patch of shade on the hottest day of the year. The pyramid is barely a finger's length in any direction and looks to be made of a crude sort of glass, so dark and malformed as to be nearly opaque. A small creature - or something - can be seen moving inside. A soft skittering sound whispers from within the pyramid. If it is shaken, the sound increases dramatically in volume, as if something within were awakened and agitated by the jarring motion. The object makes its owner feel remarkably cooler, like passing through a tree's shadow on a hot day.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This glass globe holds a viscous cocktail of pulsating pink and purple auras, muddied by folding layers of putrid decay. This foul brew was harvested from somewhere in the depths of the Bloom. Tormented, haunting whispers of the Bloom's digested victims still trickle from the object.\n\nIf the globe was hurled, the sludge would spatter everyone in a small radius. Any person struck by the sludge would experience the same mental torments as the hapless victims of the Bloom, whose dissipating minds are still contained in the syrupy muck.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This tubular flask has no opening to release the essence trapped within. Instead, the flask must be cracked open to release a sparkling blue mist. Inhaling the mist will cause you to experience the last moments of a majestic elder unagran, swimming free in the depths of the ocean. Its two rows of eyelike organs sparkle vividly, the long, undulating, armored skin crackling with electricity.\n\nInhaling this mist also produces a sense of lost freedom, of something great being stolen - the unfathomable comfort of the vast, open sea. This is followed by a desire for vengeance. The unagran's life was stolen, and for this, someone must pay.\n\nFor the duration of the effect, you will experience visions of life as an elder unagran and gain a measure of the creature's strength and rage. When you speak, your words will be echoed by clicks and squeals, and your skin will sparkle with weak electrical impulses.</DefaultText>

When held near one's head, the surface suddenly becomes transparent, and a droplet of some glowing red substance comes alive within it, writhing and rippling menacingly.\n\nOnce placed firmly in the ear, a din of whispering voices becomes audible. Each voice seems to be individually comprehensible. One's mind is filled with possibilities and spoken words seem to leave of their own accord off the tongue, controlled and steered by the voices within this bauble. Once the conversation is over, the voices cease and the marble becomes inert.</DefaultText>

When placed on the skin, it grips the bone with its armored claws and inserts whiplike tendrils into the nervous system, probing the host's brain. This coupling permanently makes the user more mentally attuned to certain artifacts. After a short while, the creature disengages from the brain, releases a cloud of spores invisible to the naked eye, and dies.</DefaultText>

The crystal shimmers with barely restrained power, occasionally shifting as if testing the strength of its constraints. When you deactivate the container, the crystal loses its integrity, shattering into two parts, which in turn will shatter into two, and so on and so forth, smaller and smaller. With each breaking, the crystal unleashes a protective energy that wraps around the user, turning away incoming strikes, though it is not capable of turning away immediate attacks.</DefaultText>

When sated, or when no more impurities are sensed, it "excretes" purified material back into the host, shrinking as it does so. At the completion of the process, the sin eater falls away, shriveling into a desiccated husk of its former self.</DefaultText>

Wishing to atone for past misdeeds, they fling their possessions outward in acknowledgement of being cured of greed, hatred, and delusion. While in that altered state, they wander aimlessly, contemplating how they may best benefit all the inhabitants of the Ninth World. This appears to be a conduit for a third party's contemplation, as the words come through even from creatures that do not know the human language.</DefaultText>

A small band of metal on the back reads "Property of Alrus" in faintly legible letters.\n\nWhen used, this bracer emits an aura of flame that surrounds its wearer. The flame burns anything that comes in contact with him or his weapons. However, due to its cobbled nature, the bracer also slightly burns its wearer while in use.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This pod-like lump of Bloom-flesh has the shape and size of a small, hemispherical bit of fruit. That is where the similarities end, as the fleshbud is quivering and still very much alive. A mangle of teeth and tongue-like protrusions appear on one side whenever the lump is anywhere close to living flesh. When applied to bare skin, the fleshbud bites and grafts itself to the host, taking on the texture and appearance of the host's skin. Once attached, it vastly improves the metabolic processes of the host, increasing quick reaction speed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This orb floats above your hand on its own gravity. Its core is as dark as the heart of a dead star. It emanates enormous power. Passing your hand through the ethereal green flames rising from the orb, you feel a chill run down your spine and can't shake the nagging suspicion that some small part of you has been whisked away.\n\nThis object appears to be an ancient matter-energy converter; when new, it might have unleashed the energy in a grain of sand to create an explosion the size of a small town. The center of the orb is a pocket dimension. It is dark but for the flashes of lightning as new energy is added, illuminating the endless seas of grey sand from the untapped energy introduced by previous owners.\n\nAlthough the orb has no visible lines or defects, it is nonetheless cracked - and the crack is in its very tie to reality. The energy that may be passed between your world and the pocket dimension is both limited and corrupted, and it may flow in only one direction at a time. In its current state, the orb can spew green flames at your opponents, or you can merge with the orb to absorb energy from attacks made against you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The garment has no defined edges, like a wrapping cover, but someone fitted onto it a dozen crude metal hooking fasteners. When properly draped over one's outer clothing, the fasteners provide a weathertight overlap. Ethereal and mist-like, the shroud's almost non-color nonetheless reflects a vibrant white not unlike the snow and ice it protects against.\n\nIt may well have been plundered from a grave, but the material seems new: spotless and utterly devoid of wrinkles. Why anyone would want to protect the dead from the cold is a valid question. It will find better use amongst the living.</DefaultText>

      <ID>1020</ID>
      <DefaultText>This loop of metal is constructed from a short band that splits and branches, threads twisting and bending in upon themselves before seamlessly reforming at the other end. The coils are maddeningly knotted,  making it impossible to trace a complete path, yet at the same time a pattern waits to be revealed, just beyond the edge of comprehension.\n\nOf the handful unearthed through the ages, these rings were once dismissed as mere trinkets until an unnamed collector discovered twins purely by chance. It is said that this man wore one of the matched set and gifted his lover with the other. During one particular amorous encounter, both were astounded by their shared sensations and an oddly heightened sense of awareness. When the couple identified the rings as the source of this connection, further use showed that they mutually experienced every physical pain, pleasure, and sickness felt by either. This effect disappeared when they wore an unmatched pair of bands.</DefaultText>

Upon touching the weapon for the first time, it grants an image of a long-lost, wondrous place, imbuing a sense of smoldering betrayal and tremendous loss. The immense power of the blade is self-evident, but the havoc and pain it brings to foes seem to stay with it, and its bearer, as a lingering cloud of guilty remembrance.</DefaultText>

When touched, you also notice it warms up quickly and a slight vibration can be felt. Hexagonal buttons sit behind a small screen on the top, allowing you to fire a blob of energy that affects the target's mind directly, filling them with overwhelming visions of pleasure.\n\nThe grip and trigger seem to have been fitted on later, made from a dull grey metal, cold, with a few thick wires running from the top of the grip into the barrel. Despite the striking dissimilarity between the individual parts, the whole assembly is masterfully engineered, with a clear purpose in mind.</DefaultText>

The device's material has a metallic blue sheen, but it feels warm and soft. Putting pressure on the tube causes one of the muzzles to spit forth a minute needle.\n\nThe muzzles try to point wherever the operator's looking. The device constantly hums quietly. Occasionally, and with no clear cause, a row of bright red lights appears on one side of the weapon, and the hum becomes a shrill wordless scream. This subsides in a few heartbeats with no apparent side effects.</DefaultText>

Only a few armor-smiths could accomplish such a feat, so armor of this quality is rare and prized.\n\nA tiny module containing a simple machine intelligence has also been incorporated into the armor. It perceives the nature of incoming attacks and attempts to modify the material composition of the breastplate to better protect the wearer. This is far more effective against physical attacks, but the armor provides a lesser measure of protection against chemical, transdimensional, and other forms of damage.</DefaultText>

Occasionally, its appearance seems to shift subtly in a disconcerting manner - this sense of unease grows if the armor is observed for long stretches of time. When worn, the armor emits a dissonant hum at the edge of human hearing. It vanishes if the wearer focuses upon it, but it returns when their attention wanders.</DefaultText>

But if enough strength is applied, they can be disjoined and connected again, each time reforming into perfect circles.\n\nWhatever their original purpose, similar objects were once commonly used as a means of infiltrating well-guarded palaces and temples, particularly in assassination attempts. An assassin and a willing accomplice, usually a bribed servant or a scheming advisor, would each wear one of a pair as an armband, which could be concealed easily. When one of them squeezed his band firmly with the other hand, the two conspirators would immediately swap places, moving the killer right to where the target was, and the traitor away from harm.</DefaultText>

After recovering from the shock of seeing his ancestors rise from their graves, he made the best of his situation and put them to work tending the fields. The farmer took ill, and ultimately passed. His "family", it is said, can still be seen ceaselessly toiling to harvest his long barren lands to this day.</DefaultText>

Scholars have held that they were originally intended to be tools of diplomacy, social bonding, or perhaps simply personal growth, as they fill their bearers with great affection for every nearby being registered by the datasphere. Unfortunately, the contemporary human mind - perhaps unlike the minds of the orbs' creators - is incapable of retaining the overwhelming waves of empathic understanding they induce. Love passes swiftly, leaving only an acute consciousness of others' flaws and a visceral sense of loss.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mechanisms of similar numenera are oft speculated upon by Aeon Priests; mayhap the weakness in the pattern channels the strike, or echoes ripple backwards through time, or space-time itself is bruised and bent and the wound is merely an expression of such. But those with a deeper understanding of time have a more disturbing answer. The artifact caused the older wound before the fight ever began: a more recent mishap, an inexplicable accident long ago, or even a tragic event in childhood. The injury then troubles the victim, perhaps for years, slowing them such that the current attack lands - and thus causality is preserved.</DefaultText>

Their migratory patterns are too complex to decipher, and thus they are doubly rare due to both the difficulty of reliably finding their nests and their diminishing numbers, for they have been hunted to near extinction.</DefaultText>

Nestled upon an ancient subterranean library, the Waromites spent their entire lives dedicated to excavating all manners of lore from its depths. One of the greatest honors a Waromite could be bestowed was to be condensed into a pure extract of knowledge. The exact ritual remains unknown, but involves the scholar being taken down into the deepest tunnels of the library by two of the Waromite elders.\n\nThese extracts were extremely valuable and rare due to the insight they give, but began resurfacing at an alarming rate and rumors regarding slavery have begun flourishing in the aldeias surrounding Warom. One of the Waromites, whether a slave or not, must have passed by Sheen's shop. She must have offered her unique services to create something very similar to the extract.</DefaultText>

Decades later, the 'god' gifted the armor to the third incarnation of Sugeng, the Eternal Diplomat. He in turn traded the breastplate to a merchant house of Sagus Cliffs in exchange for future favors. Asked why he would give away such a powerful artifact he replied "there is no gain without sacrifice".\n\nSeveral copies of this unique breastplate have been produced since, though none are quite as remarkable as the original.</DefaultText>

Almost two hundred years ago, one Aeon Priest sneaked into the Citadel of the Conduit to study a suit of spine armor that was stored there. He claimed that it was a living creature, at least as intelligent as humankind. Moreover, each time it bound itself to a wearer, it grew more clever and robust. The Aeon Priest theorized that its wearers were inadvertently helping the spine armor evolve into some new form of life. Unfortunately, the Aeon Priest disappeared in the Beyond, and the rest of his findings were lost.</DefaultText>

Over time, it was discovered the people saved retained above average regeneration and constitution months after the event.

The creatures did not offer any resistance and often made themselves visible to hunting parties. After years of over-hunting, the creatures disappeared suddenly.

Kistilan discerned it gave the wearer several augmented abilities to move through the air, water, and woods at hastened speeds and with keen sense of a desired objective.\n\nAfter years of study, he unlocked the abilities of the device, and became known a master of teleportation, transmutation, and augmentation esoteries beyond the ken of any of his rivals.\n\nAnd this was his downfall - he became too confident and boisterous in his travels, fearing no natural or magical impediment. On a bet with a nemesis, he wagered he could cross through a maelstrom that was passing over the Garravia Sound. He failed, and the compass sank with him to the center of the Sound.\n\nIf this is indeed the device in question, its massive powers have been used up by Kistilan.

      <DefaultText>You suddenly notice a black, tiny humanoid figure dancing around the curvature of the index fingers, down toward the palm and around the back of the glove, each footstep marked by an almost-imperceptible metal clang. The tiny man is clad in black leather armor - and he is not dancing, but defending himself against an invisible opponent. The sounds grow louder the longer you watch. He deftly maneuvers  with sword and buckler, growing ever-larger as you watch. Suddenly, he stops and faces you, and says, "Meeezhhaul kor veena.." He stares at you, imploring you to take on his eternal task. You look away with difficulty, and the man goes back to his fighting.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A small, fine blade of transdimensional energy extends from a hilt of azure steel. With a twist of the hand, it can quickly be switched on and off. The scalpel's maker, Ioxu, has improved the blade, making it more effective as a weapon. It rapidly shimmers between different realities and ignores most mundane armors, though it was designed to be particularly effective when cutting the flesh of the Bloom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This metal object is small enough to rest easily in your hand. It is a small depiction of an astraphin monolith, engraved with peculiar glyphs that do not mean anything to you. If you slam or throw the tapering end into the ground, the object spreads metallic, root-like vines through the ground, and once embedded it activates. When the icon is active, it acts as a conduit for energy tapped from the nearest celestial body, emanating a blazing power that scorches and blinds any unfortunate who draws too close.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This leather-bound journal is filled with various diagrams, notes, and observations of the machines you found near the engines buried beneath Sagus Cliffs. The handwriting is your creator's, and it chronicles his analysis of the datasphere - the net of information that surrounds and permeates the world's air. Some people have drawn power from the world, and others have found a way to transmit knowledge in the blink of an eye. It seems that these machines may have been intended to transmit consciousness itself... or at least to take a rudimentary first step in that direction. The exact steps are unclear, though someone with an extensive background in consciousness transfer or machine intelligences might be able to recreate his work.</DefaultText>

Its temporal energies are limited in scope, capable of moving forward or backward in time by a few seconds at most. It wasn't designed for greater range, so you can only speculate as to what sort of device required such narrow movements through time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This moss-covered pebble looks almost ordinary, and if it were lying on the ground, it would be difficult to spot. But the moss shifts in unexpected ways, and the pebble vibrates as it does. If held against the skin, the moss latches on and is absorbed, providing powerful resuscitating energies. These pebbles are found by diving into the waters around Sagus Cliffs, perhaps grown by an unknown interaction with the surrounding numenera. The moss was further treated and refined, detached and reattached to the pebble, a process that amplifies the interaction between the two objects and increases the effects when the moss is absorbed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This pliable synth container is tightly sealed, holding a swirling purple gas. As you observe the object, the gas seems to move faster and faster, pushing against the container where you touch it. The substance was harvested from a vast structure in The Beyond, before being treated by the Order of Truth with processes to amplify the effects of the gaseous substance. When inhaled, the rush of mental energy is vastly more powerful.</DefaultText>
