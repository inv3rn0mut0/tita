You can also sense the faint presence of hundreds of tiny half-formed minds, reaching faint and fuzzy thoughts into your own. And, a moment later, you realize you can also sense the names of every one of those minds.

      <DefaultText>At first is seems impossible. The thoughts of the other unborn are strong and insistant. How will you find thoughts weaker and quieter than the rest. 

Then you notice - not a thought - but an irregularity of rhythm, a faint, stumbling pulse, slower than the rest, coming from the back of the cave. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the name comes to your lips, you feel a great weight in your mind and your heart. You realize that you are not just speaking a name, but giving the child an integral piece of yourself to strengthen it on its way to birth. It hurts like you were tearing out your soul with your bare hands.

      <DefaultText>As the name leaves your mouth, your vitality goes with it, draining you, making your bones ache and your mind wither. It hurts worse than any death you've experienced, but as you weaken, you feel the child's presence growing stronger and more aware. She knows who she is now, and who you are, and that you brought her back from the abyss. 

You can feel her nestling beside your heart, sleeping in the peaceful certitude of safety. 

Your daughter lives. You saved her.

      <DefaultText>You move in the general direction of the struggling pulse, then back and forth over the bed of eggs, trying to find the source. Finally it is below you - an egg, smaller and fainter of light than the rest, it's pulse beating behind and out of time. 

Cintra's life force is within it, but it is fading, flickering. Soon it will gutter and die entirely. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You know then that Cintra was right. There will be a price, a physical, actual price, if you go through with the naming. You will be weaker, your mind will be weaker, so that the child can be stronger. 

It's not too late to stop. You can remain silent and you will not be harmed. But what will happen to the child? </DefaultText>

{NATHAN: My idea here is that if the player has one of these skill options (currenty Lore: Natural Science, Lore: Wilderness, or Visual Perception), they will pick up on the fact that the unnamed eggs are giving energy to the named ones. They can go back and tell Cintra what they saw along with their good interpretation: that Cintra's child is enabling the other ghibra children to live and grow stronger, thus making the community stronger as a whole.

(Or better: give the player multiple interpretations to what they saw, each based on different Tides, allowing them to comfort Cintra or not.)}</DefaultText>
