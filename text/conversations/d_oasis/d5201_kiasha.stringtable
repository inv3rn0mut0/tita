The merchant sucks a deep breath through its gills. "I have injections that will allow you to speak other languages, injections that will make anyone fall in love with you, injections that will make you see the world around you as a far-future wonderland, injections that will increase loquacity, transparency, veracity, profundity, rotundity, duality, solemnity, and both inner and outer beauty and peace."</DefaultText>

His eyes close for a full five seconds, then he opens them again and looks around, surprised. "Why are you all looking at me? Did I do something amazing? Who are you going to try the love injection on?"</FemaleText>
