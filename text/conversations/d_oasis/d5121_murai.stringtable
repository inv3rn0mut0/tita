      <DefaultText>A friendly looking ghibra of the bipedal variety bows as you approach. Its scales are a cheerful sea blue, and its sash of office is bright red.

      <DefaultText>The guide bows and makes a speech you can tell it has made many times before. "By order of the Giash no air-breathers are allowed to live or travel within M'ra Jolios without a ghibra escort, or special dispensation from the Giash itself. This is primarily for the safety and protection of our honored visitors, who cannot survive underwater without artificial means. But also, it ensures that the Oasis preserves its beauty and fragile native culture, for the enjoyment of both visitors and residents alike."</DefaultText>

"But our legends suggest we ghibra were here long before that.
