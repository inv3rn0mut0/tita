      <DefaultText>A small, bright-eyed man in blue-green robes turns as you approach his stand. He has a forked beard and a forked hairstyle to match. It gives his weathered face the look of a benign demon. He looks delighted to see you.

      <DefaultText>Nieto's beard quivers with regret. "Forgive me, my friend, but it is not possible. Only visitors with special permission from the Giash are allowed to purchase the bracelets.

      <DefaultText>Nieto smiles appeasingly. "I would be happy to explain. You see, it is not possible for me to sell the bracelets. Only if you were to have special permission from the Giash could I do that. I can only rent them to you, and only if you have a guide with you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nieto pulls back his voluminous sleeves and holds up his left wrist, revealing a glittering band of silver.

      <DefaultText>Nieto throws back his head and barks a laugh. "You can indeed, my eager friend - for as long as you can hold your breath. But if you want to be able to breathe while you are there, then no. No non-ghibra can enter the Oasis without a guide or permission from the Giash, and it would be *entirely illegal* for me to help anyone break that rule."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nieto shakes his head, making his forked beard wag. "Some people think of Jerboa as nothing but a stopping place on the way to the Oasis - the place where one leaves ones shoes before entering the waters, but it has its own pleasures. I was born here, and I'd never move anywhere else."

He chuckles. "And not just because it's so easy to lose your way in the Lost Sea either."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nieto grins. "Everything happens in the Marina, my friend. All of Jerboa's and the Oasis's trade comes through here. The main passage between the two is here, and the market is here, where you can buy anything in the world - even little glass globes filled with water that look like the Oasis."

He picks up a glass globe, just as he described, and shakes it. A whirlwind of 'snow' swirls around the tiny buildings inside.  "Indeed, I have some here if you're interested. Most amusing, I assure you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dreamy look passes across Nieto's impish face. "The Oasis is the underwater garden spot of the Ninth World, my friend. The most beautiful, miraculous place on this whole, beautiful miraculous planet. Even the people are beautiful. Entrancing!"

"It is also a place of great history, mystery, and sorrow, none of which I would dare ruin for you, as you should see it for yourself." He raises a finger. "Once you rent a air-skin bracelet, that is."
