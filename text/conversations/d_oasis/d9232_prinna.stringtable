      <DefaultText>The sullen green light of the Menagerie makes shadows and angles tricky to see. From this perspective, on the prisoner side, you have a better view of the woman who shares Mazzof's captivity.

This cellmate reveals herself to be a slim Jerboan girl with slight shoulders and short curls, her hair as dark as her eyes. She can't be more than nineteen or twenty. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lost in thought, Prinna skulks back and forth, making fists with her small hands. Every now and then her lips move soundlessly, as though she were rehearsing lines for a play. Noticing your gaze, she stops and cocks an eyebrow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The images flow by quickly. A pact with your young cellmate, a promise to help her escape. Prinna keeping watch as you worked, hurling pebbles at the Kalyptein Crabs as they wander by in their shells of scavenged numenera.

      <DefaultText>She points at the rightmost hatch. "The plan is for you to have the Demon open the hatches, starting with that one into the jurulisk chamber. I sneak across, put on the water breathing thing you made, and go through into the water corridor."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then I circle aaaaaall the way around to the Lorub Sea, and swim across. I am *not* to be eaten by lorubs at this point. The Demon's at the main entrance, doing Demon... things. I have to get the Noose from it, because the Noose lets me float or fly or whatever down to the Morphling Grotto from Jolios' Peak."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Once I'm clear, I make contact with the Compatriots and we come back as soon as we can to bust you out." Prinna spreads her arms and gives you a bow.

"And *that,*" she says, "is the plan. So what else is on your mind?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A secret, huh? Okay." She pauses, considering.

"I wish you were coming with me, because even though I make fun of you for being old - which you are - you're the smartest person I know. You can outsmart anything we'd run into, Alone I'll probably die in the next room."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>She's silent for a long time, as if giving the matter serious thought.

"Here's one." She inhales. "I was *terrified* when they sent me here. I thought for sure they'd put me in with some killer or monster who'd... well. I was afraid." She gives you a nervous smile. "But you're okay, Z. You're a good cellmate."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Okay..."

She's silent for a long time, as if giving the matter serious thought.

"I feed the stray seskii in Jerboa Town even though you're not supposed to. They seem so unhappy when they're hungry. I don't like seeing them that way."</DefaultText>

      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>Finally, a whispered conversation in the dark, the last fragment of a long-incubated plan. "We get the hatch open..." "How?" "The Demon... maybe I can trick it into opening the hatch. As long as I stay inside-" "I'd rather you came with me. If I'm there the Demon isn't a problem..."

You snap abruptly back to the present, Prinna staring at you quizzically. "Kinda lost you there, Z."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memories come easily: a pact with your young cellmate, a promise to help her escape.

      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>A moment or two of tension. Something about equipment, and something that frightens Prinna. The hatches leading out...

...to the left are fire wights, dangerous, but Mazzof has something he thinks will fend them off. Prinna refusing, almost in tears...

...the rightmost hatch leads to jurulisks, eerie transdimensional things. Mazzof dislikes them, and isn't sure how to get past them, but it's the only way Prinna will go.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs, a light, carefree sound that somehow strengthens the impression of youth. "You know plenty about me, Z. It's not that interesting a story anyway. My sister and I were street laaks after my parents died when I was six. Sister was ten, she took care of me. Then she died too, and I was a lonely laak.

"I was twelve when she came down with that Ichthy Plague they think came from the ghibra. You know, white spots all over you? Wait, I guess you were already in prison by then, you missed it. Lots of people died that year, teenagers especially for some reason."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The look she gives you is halfway between concern and irritation. "Are you okay, Z? I've told you this story. Me and a couple of Compatriots did what you did - we tried to nab the Amulet of Scorgil and hold it hostage to get the attention of the Giash. We got surprised by a patrol of Gibber Tears and one of them was killed. The others got away but I got tangled in some stupid coral."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"First, we'd need another oddity or something so you could breathe underwater," she recites, counting off on her fingers. "Second, you'd have to *not* almost faint every time the Demon comes up in conversation, because... well... because you can't be fainting in the middle of an escape. Third-" she pauses.

"Actually I think that's it. Water breathing and no fainting."</DefaultText>
