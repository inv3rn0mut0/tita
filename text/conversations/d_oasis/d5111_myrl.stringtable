      <DefaultText>An excitable man in a faded kaftan waves you down. He looks perfectly ordinary except for the massive tentacle growing just above his left ear. The thing is so heavy it pulls at his head and he looks at you sideways. Nor does it seem to be under his control. As he talks it probes around blindly and he has to swat it occasionally to keep it from going up his nose.

      <DefaultText>"Sure, pal." He throws the necklace into the head. Then he pulls the necklace back out along with a cypher and gives both to you.

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>A memory comes to you of the Changing God spending weeks patiently putting different objects into the head's mouth. Eventually, he realized that the head used the atoms of whatever went into it as fuel to open a portal to other worlds, and sometimes it displaced something in that world. He thought of it as "the Vault," and he soon figured out which items would get him a return on his investment most times.

For example, right now you have an inkling that 1,123 shins would get you something.</DefaultText>
