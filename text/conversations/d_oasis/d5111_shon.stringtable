      <DefaultText>An attractive - and entirely normal-looking - young woman takes a fishy-smelling bundle from her pack and hands it to an older woman with the skin and beaked head of a turtle, but no shell. The turtle-woman grudgingly gives her a few shins in return and trudges off. 

"Right. Who's next?" says the young woman, looking around. She frowns as she sees you. 

{SCRIPT: This conversation should start with a bark string conversation between Shon and Breggi, an older mutant lady. I don't know how to do that, so here it is. 

Breggi - "What's this? I asked for white fin."

Shon - "Then go yourself next time. I got what was fresh."

Breggi - "You take advantage sometimes, Shon. You really do."}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman shakes her head. "Not selling. Delivering. I'm the only one around here who can go into the market without getting stared at or beaten to a pulp, so I pick up necessities and bring them back here."

She casts an eye after the old woman. "Not that everyone's grateful."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks around, then shrugs. "What you see is what you get. Just a slum full of mutants who can't live anywhere else. It ain't the Oasis, but it's not so bad. At least we treat each other like family, which is more than I can say for the normals in the rest of Jerboa."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She growls. "My ancestors were betrayed by treacherous normals before a great battle. Those who weren't slaughtered were taken into slavery. I am the grand daughter of escaped slaves."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A pair of heroes warned them an attack was incoming. Their words swayed out elders, and my people left before they were slaughtered."

She frowns, lost in thought. "When we were children, we told each other we would have triumphed if we'd stayed and fought. But likely we would have died."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A pair of heroes warned them an attack was incoming, and convinced our elders to stay and defend ourselves. In the end, our enemies were too many, and we were forced to retreat, but at least we bled them first. At least we put up a fight."

She thumps her chest. "As far as I'm concerned, that battle was the forging of us as a tribe. We are fewer now because of it, but stronger."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She promises that she'll get rid of your mutations and let you walk in the normal world. And she can do it, but it don't last. A few weeks, and all your bumps and scales and feathers come right back, and you have to go back from another treatment. It's a scam.
