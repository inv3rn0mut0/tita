      <DefaultText>A strange creaking comes through the air-exchange vent, a sound similar to ice on a frozen pond. You can also make out the buzz of some device, probably in the walls, but connected to this cell.

      <DefaultText>Three indigo rectangles form a line above the tiny air-exchange vent in the center of this sealed hatch. Years of salt have stained its edges.

The tingling sensation returns as you approach it, thrumming against the back of your neck.</DefaultText>

Your neck prickles, as if something were gently drilling a hole in the base of your skull. You can't tell whether you are feeling a sound, or hearing a touch.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A ::click:: vibrates your being, and reality loses all form, becoming an endless murmur, as if a million hushed conversations were going on around you. With some effort, you're able to distinguish individual voices - the intelligences that operate the Menagerie, all talking at once.

One of them is very different from the others. It stands apart, exerting a pull that becoms irresistable once the weight of its notice falls on you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One good slam is enough to convince you not to try another. Mazzof probably still needs his bones, and this door would break them all before it opened.</DefaultText>
