      <DefaultText>[Waree plays in the market. You notice her eyes are a striking shade of violet - something you haven't seen in human or ghibra.

In playing with Waree, she eventually admits her name. You realize her mother died in the destruction of the Atolyu Cay, and she doesn't know where her father is.

For some reason, you want to help her find her father.]</DefaultText>
