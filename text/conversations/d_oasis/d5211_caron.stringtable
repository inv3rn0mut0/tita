      <DefaultText>Before you can defend yourself, Caron's sergeant touches a disk on its belt and the water pressure around you increases tenfold, crushing every part of your body, inside and out.

As you convulse, the guards bind your hands and feet. Then, just before the pain becomes unbearable, the sergeant touches the disk again and you feel a wave of relief.

"If you want more of that, just try something."

The guards float you away like a sack of garbage.
