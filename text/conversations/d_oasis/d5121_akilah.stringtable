      <DefaultText>A shop filled with canteens, ropes, invisible tents, packs that are bigger inside than out, sand masks, dried animals that cook instantly when you skin them, and hundreds of other supplies for the would-be explorer. As you enter a woman's head pops up from behind a mound of tent canvas and gives you a cool once over.

      <DefaultText>She crosses her arms. "Not to amateurs, I don't. Unless you're an experienced caravaner, my goods are not for sale. The Lost Sea is too dangerous."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "Sorry. I only sell to experienced caravaners, and you are as green as a Gibber's nethers. The Lost Sea is too dangerous."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs. "Fine. Then I do have something to sell you. But it's *your* life in *your* hands, understand? I won't take any responsibility for this."

She puts a hand on a shelf behind her. "It's kind of a life line. It'll help you get back home if you get in trouble out there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Everything! It is a vast and unnatural desert in which traditional navigation does not work. And that's not even *counting* the cragworms, vapes, and sarraks you'll almost certainly run across." She looks you right in the eye. "Listen to someone who has been there. Unless you know what you're doing, you will go in, and never come back out. No one will even find your bones."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Akilah looks in your eyes, then steps back, unnerved. "I... I guess it won't. I've never seen eyes so old." She shivers. "Fine. I have something for you. It's kind of a life line that'll help you get back home if you get lost out there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Akilah edges back, eyes widening. "Your one of those... what do you call 'em... *castoffs*, right? I've heard stories of your kind." Suddenly her face hardens. "But trust me, the Lost Sea is enough to even kill one of *you*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She pulls a segmented metal band from the shelf and presses a button on it. Tiny translucent tendrils fan out from it's edges like ghostly centipede legs. "It's called a Ghost Belt. Wear it and you leave after-images of yourself along your trail that only you can see. If you get lost, you can follow them back home."

"It won't help you get anywhere, but it'll help you get back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I carry a lot of useful things, but don't you *dare* go into the Lost Sea without that belt. If you do, it's on your own head."

She puts the belt back on the shelf. "Here, let me show you what else I have."
