      <DefaultText>A big man with slicked back gray hair stands in the sun with his tunic open to the waist, revealing a broad tanned belly, well furred.

He shakes his head. "No, no. It's more than that. I was partnered up with my mate Kovo back in my Bloom days - him the Memovira, and me his right hand man. Thick as thieves we were. Thicker. Ran that place right, too. No complaints from anybody. But Dracogen was a particular friend of that bitch who became the new Memovira, and was a particular enemy of ours, on account of us wantin' to tax his profits. I *know* it was him who helped her turn the Bloom against us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't laugh, but it's called the Figment." He shrugs. "You know how kids'll say, 'I'll hit you so hard, your whole family'll die?' That's what it does. It kills individuals who exist in more than one place and time. And that's Dracogen all over - a bunch of false faces hiding a single, rotten-hearted fiend."

      <DefaultText>"General principles?"

He shakes his head. "No, no. It's more than that. I was partnered up with my mate Kovo back in my Bloom days - him the Memovira, and me his right hand man. Thick as thieves we were. Thicker. Ran that place right, too. No complaints from anybody. But Dracogen was a particular friend of that bitch who became the new Memovira, and was a particular enemy of ours, on account of us wantin' to tax his profits. I *know* it was him who helped her turn the Bloom against us."</DefaultText>
