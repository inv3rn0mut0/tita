He composes himself with difficulty. "It is painful to live it all again through your words, but to hear that he has laid it all bare suggests an honesty he never allowed himself back then. It suggests that he has looked in the mirror at last. But..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Auvigne's face crumples, and though it's impossible to tell under the water, it looks as if he might be weeping. "He has admitted it all, then."

He composes himself with difficulty. "It is painful to live it all again through your words, but to hear that he has laid it all bare suggests an honesty he never allowed himself back then. It suggests that he has looked in the mirror at last. But..."</DefaultText>
