      <DefaultText>A massive bio-mechanical machine sits with its intake valve inside the bubble of the Oasis, and its snail-like back end sticking out into the marina. Large pipes snake out from under it and across to the fountain in the center of the square, and several guards keep an eye on it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You put an ear to the machine's side, and hear an aryhthmic thumping with each inhalation. The pump shudders and groans like a living thing every time it happens. Indeed, you realize now that it is in fact a living thing, and know there is distress. The tension is affecting the creature's desire to filter the water properly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you focus on the annulet, you become aware of the pump's presence in your mind, and sense that the source of it's pain is a foreign object lodged in its upper intestinal tract.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Examining the outside of the pump tells you nothing. Nor does touching it, but when you put an ear to its side, you hear a thumping and gurgling with each of its inhalations. It sounds like there's a blockage in its upper intestinal tract.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You watch as the guard closes a pressure valve, then removes the metal plate from the pump's shell, rolls up his sleeve, and reaches into its fleshy intestines. After a tense moment of fishing around, he pulls out a piece of flanged machinery, bristling with sharp and broken edges. It looks like it was sheered off at the base. He tosses it to you.
