      <DefaultText>"Very unfortunate. A group of Compatriots made an attempt on the life of Counciler Semat when she visited me on a matter of business. This young man Auvigne, however, blocked the assassins and drove them off with authority."

      <DefaultText>"I am not certain. I know that Counciler Semat invited the young man into the Oasis and promised him a reward, but what the nature of that reward was, or what he did after that, is unknown to me. All I know is that I have not seen this Auvigne again, in Jerboa or the Oasis."</DefaultText>
