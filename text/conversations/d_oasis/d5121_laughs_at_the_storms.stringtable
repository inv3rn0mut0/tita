      <DefaultText>A dreary market stall filled with dusty merchandise. There are no customers. It looks like there haven't been any customers for a long long time. The scene fills you with a sudden and unbidden despair.

A gaunt, unhealthy looking woman sits in the back, flipping through a book, but apparently too miserable to actually read it. 

She sighs as you approach. "Yes?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Everything. I..." She hesitates, as if weighing whether to tell you more, then sighs and continues. "I'm under a curse. My life is falling apart. My health, my business, my equipment, decaying before my eyes. Glow Braid, as you know, maintains and strengthens all devices it powers, but even it is only slowing their destruction and my ruin. Without it, though, that ruin would have already occurred, so I am holding on to the Braid in hope that some miracle will happen before it too fails me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman pulls a box from under her table, then opens it and turns it toward you. Inside is simple silver necklace, but somehow, just looking at it blackens your mood and gives you a sick sense of unease - the same feeling that overcame you when you first entered the shop.

"It's called Elia's Anguish," says the woman. "And it has destroyed my life. I got it from a colleague I cheated and haven't been able to get rid of it since. No matter how I try, it always finds its way back."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>She groans. "It will ruin your life. It makes everything you do harder, more exhausting, more futile, and everyone around you will feel the same. And, if you hold onto it long enough, you will lose the will to even try. Believe me, I know."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>She brightens, slightly. "Truly? Knowingly? I don't know if I should thank you or give you my condolences."

She closes the box and hands it to you. "Once - I should say *if* - you get rid of it, come back and I'll give you the glow braid. But I'll know if you haven't done it right. I'll feel it. Or... more likely, it'll come back to me before you do. And...." She gives you a sad smile. "If you can't handle the curse anymore, just drop it wherever you are. It'll come back to me and you'll be free."

It's maddening."  

She frowns. "Maybe if you destroyed it, or left it somewhere it was impossible to return from. I don't know."</DefaultText>

She shrugs. "Not that it matters. If it hadn't returned that way, it would have been another, just as impossible. It always comes back."</DefaultText>

I don't know what you did, but I know it worked. The Anguish is gone, and gone for good this time. I don't feel miserable in the first time in forever."

She crosses to the trunk at the back of the store and opens it, then takes out a bale of Glow Brade. "Here. You earned it."

I don't remember the necklace being in that haul, but it must have been, because it was in my bag when I got home."
