      <DefaultText>Zenia pulls the sphere out of its bag and hands it to you with evident anxiety.

It feels no different from any other cold, dead, unpolished stone, nor, at a glance, does it look special, until you notice the roughness is in fact an intricate pattern of tiny, crystalline filaments...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first, Zenia does no more than give a curt nod, but then it wells up in her, and though she tries to choke it back, her grief spills forth, more a wailing than a weeping as the decades-old dam breaks within her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zenia spits and glances over her shoulder at the construct. "Decanted," she says, like a curse. "Kidnappers and body-snatchers. Didn't used to be this way, but apparently the Giash invited them in to scoop us up as they see fit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your mind vastens and the sounds around you change: the hubbub of laborers yields to an endless, toneless song, undiluted knowledge poured straight into your ears, a wild flood that could drown a mind, wash wisdom away forever. But there are strains among it to be caught and strung together, disparate facts spun into true learning, for all has aligned to place you and Zenia precisely where and when you must be, in body and mind, to reach into this wealth of data.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yet there are not strands enough to weave the answers you seek. You need *more*, and you see where they can be found: Zenia herself. It is a simple matter to rip the necessary threads from her own memories, never mind the ragged edges left behind, never mind the screaming as the song of data fades and you return to the world of things.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As Zenia sobs on the ground, you give her the truth she sought. The woman is her mother, and the sphere reveals one who awaits.

At last, the caravan leader composes herself, wipes snot and tears from her face, and in a flat voice says, "I don't even know why I cared."</DefaultText>

"But, a deal it was." She throws you a bag of shins. "And you'll have your flight, when you need it." With that, she turns away.
