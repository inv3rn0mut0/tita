      <DefaultText>She clutches your hand. "Thank you! This means more to me than I can - "

She cuts off and fishes in the folds of her flowing mourning clothes. "Oh, but I must try. Please, it isn't nearly enough for saving the life of a child, but take these shins. You deserve a thousand times as many."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a moment, the ghibra looks up at you with hopeless eyes. "I mourn the death of two loved ones. My bonded, Hiulen, who lies here, entombed in coral, and... and his child, who will soon lie beside him because Hiulen did not live long enough to name her."</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>She takes a moment to compose herself, then speaks. "A few ghibra are born within the body, like humans, but most are born of eggs, left by the mother in the spawning ground of Oblevis Reef for the... father to name and give them the strength to hatch. My..."

A sob escapes her, then she continues. "My husband was killed before... before he could do this, and so my child will now die unborn."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "A husband gives more than a name. He gives part of himself, weakens himself, to make the child strong enough to live. I know of no male willing to make such a sacrifice unless he would also be a husband and father, and I do not want a husband, except for he who - " 

Her sobs overcome her as she looks again at the grave. "Except for he who I can no longer have."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"W-what? Me? I... Well, it's not that I wouldn't be delighted, and I have certainly proved myself capable of bringing a child into the world many times over, but this, er... weakening she spoke of.  Though of course I have no troubles in that area, I... I wouldn't want to, uh... develop any, as a result, if you understand me."

      <DefaultText>Riastrad says nothing, but Satsada's voice rings in your head. "It is difficult enough for you and I to reach poor Riastrad.
