      <DefaultText>This slender, armor-plated humanoid is no simple automaton. An ice-speckled dome on the construct's chest holds a frozen human head, cradled in a glowing nest of cables. 

A buzzing, emotionless voice issues from the polished grille on the automaton's head.

      <DefaultText>This creature is in far better shape than the malfunctioning construct you met in the Bloom. Its armor is a creamy white, unmarked by damage or joint grease. Even the frozen head in its chest seems... fresher.

      <DefaultText>"This one's designation is likely beyond your understanding," it says, spreading its delicate hands apologetically. "Your kind, however, commonly refers to ours as 'Decanted'. We preserve our heads within these constructs to  prolong our lives, and accumulate vast centuries of knowledge. We are scholars. Explorers. Seekers of beauty."

A soft bark of static emerges from the creature's grille, as if it is clearing its throat. "As I have said, however, we have received a gracious invation from the Chimaera to purchase local candidates directly from his agent. We have accepted his exciting offer."</DefaultText>

"This one has received an upgraded form for the selection and retention of prime candidates. Those of us who fail to achieve these *simple* parameters are punished with flawed or faulty components."

      <DefaultText>"We met with his agent, a graying, hirsute, overbuilt specimen with unsightly slashes of scar tissue across his brutish cheekbones." 

The automaton shakes its metal head in distaste, contrasting somewhat oddly with the fixed gaze of the severed head below. "Apologies. We find it odd that such an illustrious personage would use so unsuitable a specimen as their respresentative."

{ADAM: This node will need to be updated with Tash's description. Sharepoint doesn't have a whole lot on the guy besides "stocky", and I couldn't get anything from either version of the Kholn Village Mere.}
