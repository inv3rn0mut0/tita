      <DefaultText>She raises her chin, angry. "We ghibra have brought this trouble upon ourselves, and it is therefore up to us to bring it to a peaceful end. I have tried to convince members of the Giash to change our laws and allow the Jerboans in to the Oasis, but they would not hear me."

"If only one of them understood and had the courage to speak up about the Jerboans' true value to our society, they might stop talking about how to *stop* the air-breathers and instead start talking about how to *include* them."

      <DefaultText>"Oh, yes! Much can be learned of our past by reading the epitaphs inscribed on the graves. Wars, plagues, famines, all are reflected here - though many graves have been worn smooth, or are inscribed in unknown languages, and their history therefore lost to us."

      <DefaultText>"For a long time I did. Then I realized that the Jerboans were not to blame. The conflict itself was to blame, and the conflict stemmed from the unfair treatment of the Jerboans by the ghibra."

Her voice raises as she continues. "The Jerboans have done more than their share in turning this place into the prosperous paradise it has become - making the journey here safer and easier for the tourists who are our lifeblood, managing our trade - and yet they are denied most of its benefits, merely because some of my race fear a dilution of our *culture*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, that culture was built as much by the Jerboans outside the Oasis as the ghibra within it. To me, the isolationists' fears are nothing but disguised selfishness, and I cannot stand by and let others die as my husband did, in the name of something so worthless."

      <DefaultText>For a moment, the question stops her. "They... they must make us understand what they have done for us."

She looks up. "The Jerboans always accuse the ghibra of denying them their share of the Oasis's bounty, but to the ghibra, this is preposterous. We see ourselves as enlightened philanthropists, and feel we have already given the Jerboans more than they deserve."

      <DefaultText>"Jerboan extremists destroyed a building here in the Oasis. They are also protesting outside the Giash Chamber."

She shakes her head, her eyes distant and sad. "It's the old troubles all over again. And the cause is the same as it was before. M'ra Jolios' fear of other peoples, and what might happen if we opened our arms to them. This fear leads to unfair policies that shame us all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A small smile stirs Ir'ush's serene demeanor. "Ah, so you have met my fellow outlaw. But it appears you did not need our services. Excellent."

She nods approvingly. "Any flouting of M'ra Jolios' strict entry policies pleases me. Their unfairness is the root of all our trouble with the Jerboans."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ir'ush hesitates, then looks out across the graves. "My bonded... er, my husband, was killed the last time things reached this point. He was a guard. Jerboan Compatriots beat him to death during a riot in the Sunken Market."

She swallows. "Since then I have worked for Jerboan equality and a peaceful resolution to the conflict."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Jerboans have been protesting the Giash's exclusionary policies, which keep them from living in M'ra Jolios and sharing in the wealth that it generates. Other, more extremist Jerboans have decided that protest is not enough, and have destroyed a building in the Oasis as a warning."

She sighs. "It is this inequity that keeps the cycle of violence spinning."</DefaultText>
