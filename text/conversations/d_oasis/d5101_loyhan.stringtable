He opens the journal, which seems to be some sort of index, and flips through it, muttering to himself. Finally he nods and closes it again. "Yes, we have met before." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A wiry young man loiters near the mouth of a dark alley. He appears relaxed, except for his left hand, which nervously clutches a tattered leather journal. He gives you a friendly smile as you approach, then it falters. "Are you a returning customer? You don't look like a returning customer. Wait. Let me check."

He opens the journal, which seems to be some sort of index, and flips through it, muttering to himself. Finally he shakes his head and closes it again. "No. Never seen you before." </DefaultText>
