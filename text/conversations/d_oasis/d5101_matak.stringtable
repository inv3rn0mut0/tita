      <DefaultText>A filthy old beggar in tattered rags shuffles toward you. His skin is flaking and scaly, and he smells strongly of rotting fish, but his eyes are bright - perhaps *too* bright.

"Help," he quavers. "Help for a poor old fool who has lost all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I know not his real name, nor his motives, nor, truth be told, if he is a he at all. All I know is that he is the true power behind the Giash, telling them what to do, who to elevate, who to exile."

He shivers. "Most don't even know of his existance. And those that have heard the name believe him a myth. But I know the truth, for I have felt the touch of his hidden hand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matak looks embarrassed. "My landlady and I are on, shall we say, strained terms. She has locked me out, but held my meager posessions as hostage for her back rent. The letter is among my things."

      <DefaultText>"Your sense of justice? Your need to enter the Oasis? Your greed? Any of those should be a sufficient goad. Or were you asking why I want you to help *me*?"

The beggar draws himself up, straining for dignity. "Because I must complete my experiments. Enemies of the Oasis conspired to have me branded a madman and criminal, and I was cast out and stripped of my gills and fins, but the devices I was developing could still be the saving of the Oasis. I cannot leave the work half done."
