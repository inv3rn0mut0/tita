"Welcome, friend. I am Nieto, seller of novelties and licensed purveyor of air-skin bracelets for those who wish to visit the interior of the Oasis and see its many wonders."

      <DefaultText>A dreamy look passes across Nieto's impish face. "The Oasis is the underwater garden spot of the Ninth World, my friend. The most beautiful, miraculous place on this whole, beautiful miraculous planet. Even the people are beautiful. Entrancing!"

"It is also a place of great history, mystery, and sorrow, none of which I would dare ruin for you, as you should see it for yourself." He raises a finger. "Once you rent a air-skin bracelet, that is."

      <DefaultText>Nieto grins. "Everything happens in the Marina, my friend. All of Jerboa's and the Oasis's trade comes through here. The passage between the two is here, and the market is here, where you can buy anything in the world - even little glass globes filled with water that look like the Oasis."

He picks up a glass globe, just as he described, and shakes it. A whirlwind of 'snow' swirls around the tiny buildings inside.  "Indeed, I have some here if you're interested. Most amusing, I assure you."

      <DefaultText>Nieto shakes his head, making his forked beard wag. "Some people think of Jerboa as nothing but a stopping place on the way to the Oasis - the place where one leaves ones shoes before entering the waters, but it has it's own pleasures. I was born here, and I'd never move anywhere else."

He chuckles. "And not just because it's so easy to lose your way in the Lost Sea either."

But if you want to be able to breathe while you are there, then no. No non-ghibra can enter the Oasis without a guide or permission from the Giash, and it would be entirely illegal for me to help anyone break that rule."

I was born here, and I'd never move anywhere else."

He chuckles. "And not just because it's so easy to lose your way in the Lost Sea either."
