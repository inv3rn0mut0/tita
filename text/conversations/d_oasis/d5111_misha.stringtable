      <DefaultText>A woman with three arms slouches outside a hovel, two arms crossed over her chest and the third holding up a small tube. Every now and then she sticks one end of the tube in her mouth and inhales. This is followed by a loud crack and a spark shooting from the tube, after which the woman sighs and shivers.

The sign over the door of the hovel in the shape of a chiurgeon's scalpel. Dispite this, the woman's clothes are pristine. There is no blood on them. She looks up as you approach.

      <DefaultText>Tybir's hands ball into fists, and he opens his mouth as if to speak, then slowly shuts it again. He hangs his head. "Surely it's the only sane thing to do, knowing me as he does. I don't blame him a bit."

He looks up at you, his eyes bottomless black wells of regret. "Come, lad, let's be off. I'm your man from here on in."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Misha steps back, wary. "It's you who is the liar. You said you would accept Auvigne's answer with no argument, no matter what it was, and here you are screaming at me."

She laughs, bitter. "Auvigne was right. You haven't changed at all. Get out of here!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He advances on her with murder in his eyes, then catches himself and turns away. "And why should I change when the world never stops kicking me?"

He looks up at you, his eyes harder and more humorless than you have ever seen them. "Come, lad, let's be off. I'm your man from here on in. And the dirtier the work, the better."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Misha watches him go with undisguised loathing in her eyes, then gives you some of the same. "Keep him on a short leash, friend. Or you may be the one to be bitten."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But as he starts away from the chiurgery, Misha reaches after him. "Tybir, wait. Come back."

He turns, and she steps to him, a look of disbelief on her face. "You... you passed the test. Auvigne said it would never happen. He said you would never accept his decision as you had promised you would. He said you would rail at me, and demand to see him, and I could see in your eyes that you wanted to, but... you fought it. You walked away."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can you blame him?" asks Misha. "He had to know if you'd really changed."

She takes his right hand in one of her lefts. "He is at the moment guarding Giash Member Semet in his home, but once the protests are over and the Giash meets again you will find him waiting for you at Jolios Peak."</DefaultText>

She smiles sadly. "That's why he first came to me. He hoped my machine could change him, but I cannot give a man gills, nor change his internal organs. I could make him *look* like a ghibra, but not eat or breathe like one."</DefaultText>
