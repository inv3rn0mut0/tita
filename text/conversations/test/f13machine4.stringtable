      <DefaultText>This is a vaguely humanoid statue with an almost-familiar face on its dreadlocked head. No matter where you stand, its marble eyes seem to follow you. Its mouth is partially open, as if in anticipation.

The statue is made of smooth stone.

It's the last statue in this room... well, apart from the one that's across the small fissure in the floor here, anyway. Scratches on the floor tell you that this statue has been moved (though 'dragged' might be the better term) from its original spot.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You throw your back into the effort, heaving and straining as you force the statue back into its original position. Once you get it back into place, hidden catches in the base of the statue seem to fasten the statue to the ground and it settles deeper into the ground. Light spills across the chasm, creating a bridge between this statue and its partner.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You throw yourself into it, but your efforts do nothing but leave you panting at the base of the statue. It's really heavy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though the statue looks smooth, your lightly questing fingers discover a small latch at each of the statue's heels. Lifting it, you discover a small button. When you depress the button, nearly-invisible rollers push out from the statue's feet, allowing you to push it into place with no trouble.

The statue's face seems to grin in satisfaction, and a stately carpet of pulsing  energy rolls across the fissure to meet the statue's partner.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>To your great surprise, the statue's legs click, and it rolls back into place without any further prompting on your part. You could swear that the expression on its face is almost smug.

As it locks into its original position, a wave of energy pours from it to create a bridge across the fissure. The statue on the other side seems to settle, almost as if it were relieved.</DefaultText>
