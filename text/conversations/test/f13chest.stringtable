      <DefaultText>This statue is about your size, in the shape of a crouching, naked humanoid clutching its head and pressed against the floor so that its back is to the ceiling. You cannot see its features at all, but it reminds you of agony. Its materials are of... you struggle for the words for a moment, and the words 'stronglass' and 'synthsteel' come to mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Even with all your strength, you don't think you could move this. Once you heave your shoulder into it, you get the feeling that it is an enduring force, not subject to mere mass and muscle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Oddly, it doesn't seem cold or damp. It's almost like flesh, in fact. You can feel a slight  ridge running along the the statue's back - it feels like a deliberate line.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is extraordinarily lifelike, though the sculptor took some liberties with anatomy. For instance, most people don't have small holes by their ribcages. If this were intended to be an arrow-hole or something. The statue's ear is also well designed... you're not entirely sure how the artist could bore so deeply into the head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It seems to describe an arc around the statue's back, starting at its left shoulderblade, reaching to its right, extending down the length of its side, and cutting back to the left hip.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a superhuman effort, you manage to compress enormous force into your fingertips and separate the line. As you do so, you see that this is not a statue at all... it seems to be a container of some sort!

You push the statue's back - the lid - out of the way, and it separates from the statue and crashes onto the floor.

Inside it, you see a belt.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>You hold the device in your hand and watch it reshape itself to your unspoken desire, a long, thin wire emerging from the smooth casing. You insert it into the hole in the ribcage, and the statue's back slides smoothly open. It wasn't a statue... it was a container!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looking inside, you see a contraption that looks like a long, narrow strip of flexible synthetic material. A tab on either end appears to create a full fastening... so it's kind of like a belt, you guess.

You take it out of the container.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hold the device next to the statue's earhole, and it responds to your thoughts: a long, thick wire corkscrews out, boring into the cavity in the statue's head. The statue emits a piercing scream, its head jolting away from you. and the device jolts back in your hand. The statue's back slams open, narrowly missing your face, revealing that it is, in actuality, a container. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The statue's face turns to yours - it is a mirror of your own. Its back slides open, revealing a space within. The statue speaks: "Your secrets are mine, and mine yours. But be wary: there is someone else in here with us, and though he wears a familiar mind, he is not of us." The statue turns its face back to the floor, and speaks no more. Its back remains open.

      <DefaultText>You recognize this variety, surprising even yourself, and you realize that anyone shaping in this material would have no need to build in the ridge, unless they were hiding something. You find a secret button and press it. The back of the statue slides smoothly open with a sound that is almost like a contented sigh, revealing a larger space within - the statue was really a chest!</DefaultText>
