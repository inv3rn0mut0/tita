      <DefaultText>As your hand reaches toward the door, you feel an electric rush of air. Some invisible force interposes itself between you and it. A haze in the air materializes, slowly solidifies, pushing you back. Suddenly a man stands before you, a sardonic but friendly smile on his darkly handsome face.
 He seems hauntingly familiar, though to the best of your recollection, you've never seen him. His jaw is strong; he looks as if he contains some power in his lithe frame.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I tell you that if you open a door, you'll die painfully, but that I can change that, and your response is to ask who I am? You really are special, aren't you?" He looks away and mutters to himself, his brow creasing: "Yet it has full language and imaginative skills... interesting." He refocuses his intense stare on you. "Let me try again."</DefaultText>
