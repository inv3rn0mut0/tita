      <DefaultText>He looks worriedly to one corner of the calm. A new portal has appeared where there was only empty space before.

"They're in there," he says anxiously. "Whatever you did to that fragment opened up the way, but... there are a lot of them. I can *feel* them. They're angry." He gives you a nervous smile. "It's probably worth getting rid of them, but uh... make sure you're strong enough first, right?"

      <DefaultText>"Hey! I'm glad you're here. That fathom the Sorrow kicked you out of? It's opened! I don't know what you did out there, but it worked!"

He clasps you by the shoulders. "Now all you gotta do is beat that thing. Shouldn't be hard, right?" He laughs nervously.

      <DefaultText>Everything about the specter seems dreamlike. He is a hazy silhouette of blue-glass smoke, wearing stylish, well-cut clothes. He fixes his piercing eyes on you.

His handsome, bearded face seems hauntingly familiar, though you've never seen him before.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He leans in and speaks urgently. "Look, I know you have questions, and I want to answer them. I will, promise. But if the Sorrow found us here once already, then we've got to work fast. So listen to me. We've got to stop it. That means we need to get you to something called a resonance chamber. You need to activate the resonance chamber."</DefaultText>

I'm a splinter. I was waiting here for you. I called you, instinctively. And then the Sorrow came, and I knew it meant to destroy us.

      <DefaultText>"It's... hang on. Let me remember." He presses his hands to his temples and closes his eyes. "It's a glass sarcophagus. Except it's in the real world, it's inside a crystal dome somewhere, with five mechanical arms around it and a metal ring set in the floor.

      <DefaultText>"You wake up. Look over there. You see that tear in space that just opened?" 

"That's a Tidal rift. The Tides are a force, right? Like gravity or magnetism or something, except they respond to people's actions. When you step through that portal, you'll gain some power from the Tides. In theory, this Tidal rift should take you back to your body, to the real world. But don't be alarmed if you encounter something different on the way. You'll figure it out."</DefaultText>
