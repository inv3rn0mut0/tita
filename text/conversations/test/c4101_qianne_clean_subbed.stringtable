      <DefaultText>This starved, forlorn-looking woman looks to be in early middle age. Her face is pale, with high cheekbones framed by hair so blonde it's nearly white. Tattered formalwear hangs on her gaunt frame, coated by a truly spectacular layer of grime.

She has an odd dignity, beneath the bruises and rind of filth, a regal quality out of place on a woman who appears to be living in a lean-to made of fragments from the crashed transport.

She jerks at your approach. "Please! I don't have any- oh."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pale skin reddens visibly under its protective coating of muck. Even other ditches wouldn't sleep in the ditches this woman must call home.

      <DefaultText>She speaks from behind one hand, as if trying to talk and chew at the same time. "Really, it's nothing, I was just... just robbed, you see, and feared the worst when I saw you approach.

"I am Qianne, of Malevich," she adds.</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If it was recent, they might still be in the neighborhood. Rats don't tend to scurry far - which way did they go? I'll go after them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The question seems to surprise her. "You're very kind to ask," she says. "Yes. No. No."

She takes a breath.

"*Yes,* I am all right. *No,* I am not injured. They rarely cause lasting damage. And *no,* please don't bother yourself with the guards."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Two people," she says with a scowl. "No indeed, I was *not* looking forward to the meeting. A pair of brigands - they hound me regularly. In fact, they only just finished robbing me, which is why I reacted when I saw you."

She gives a peculiarly courtly bow, more an incline of the upper body. "Again, do forgive my impolite behavior. My name is Qianne of Malevich."</DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>Gingerly, she fingers a lurid purple bruise forming on her cheek. "You... you are kind to ask," she says, evidently torn between gratitude and suspicion. "Yes. No."

She pauses.

"*Yes,* I am all right. *No,* I am not hurt. They rarely cause lasting damage. One of the few things I appreciate about them."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You said they *rarely* cause lasting damage, which means this happens a lot. And if it happens a lot, you've learned to hold a shin or two back from them, right? Just hand over whatever's left and we'll part as friends."</DefaultText>

For just a moment the barrier weakens, and her formal manner and carefully trained speech are nothing more than elaborate shields against the realities of her current state. Her eyes lose focus, lost in memory, Her skin grows whiter still. Against the starkness of her flesh you can see the galaxy of bruises, cuts, and lumps more clearly than ever. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>Balling her small hands into fists, she makes a visible effort to regain composure. "As I mentioned, I am from Malevich, from a city called Stirthal. I never thought about it until I came here, but I suppose it's fair to say my life was privileged."

She plucks at her dress. It's basically held together by drit now, but beneath that supporting layer it's possible to make out the remains of lavish embroidery.

"I was at a party."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A formal party. The conversation turned to... well, to here. What our host, Lord Gunnar, called The Excessive Horizon. Beyond the Beyond.

"Several drinks later, some friends and I decided it would be fun to see the place. The far realms, you know? An adventure. As it happened, the catena was leaving that night, for a place called the Bloom. Doesn't that sound mysterious and exotic? Like a night garden in your dreams. So we bought tickets. Why not? It was returning the next morning." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods. "It crashed. Everyone was killed. Except me, of course. I lost consciousness, and when I awoke I was in the Bloom."

With a sniff, she adds, "Which is *not* a night garden of dreams.

"I had little money, all of which was stolen by those brigands on my first day. I have no way to get home, or contact anyone. I... we... hadn't even changed out of our party clothes!" She chokes back a sob, as if being unable to change her clothes was the most nightmarish part of her ordeal. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She tenses, and for a moment it seems she might make a run for it, but then her shoulders slump in a defeated way. "Fine. I should have expected that. This is all I have left, I hope it brings you great joy."

She hands over a few shins she'd secreted in her rags, then glares at you venemously. "Will that be all?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes get a size bigger at the threat of harm. She reaches for a pocket in her bedraggled party dress, then suddenly bolts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks you up and down, fear written all over her face. "Fine," she growls, reaching into her rags and pulling out a few shins. "I hope your mother is proud of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She makes a break for it, darting between passersby and disappearing into an alley.

      <DefaultText>She's surprisingly light on her feet, but it's difficult to run with only one shoe - and a mud-spattered party shoe at that. You close your hand tightly around her shoulder as she darts away, spinning her around roughly. Feeling your grip on her collarbone, she loses any remaining trace of defiance.

"Please," she says. "Just don't hurt me. This is all I have." Reaching inside her rags, she produces some coin and hands it over.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She's more nimble than she appears, or you're more clumsy than you thought.  Squirming between your outstretched hands, she grinds the miraculously unbroken heel of her one remaining shoe into your foot  before darting into the bustle and vanishing.

      <DefaultText>It's pathetic, watching her try to escape while wearing only one shoe. Your snatch her shoulder, harder than you had intended. She cries out as she's spun around, all the defiance leaving her.

"Fine! Here! Just don't... this is all I have left." With shaking hands, she reaches into a torn pocket and produces some coin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a second you have her, your fingers closing on a scrap of fabric from her ragged dress, but it tears off in your hand, allowing her to vanish among the stalls and pedestrians.
