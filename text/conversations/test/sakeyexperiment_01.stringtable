      <DefaultText>[This is Kholn Village. You and Matkina have arrived to warn of an impending attack. They don't seem to like strangers much. Neng, the blind village elder, is delighted to see Matkina again, but becomes wary and cool when introduced to you.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina does a good job explaining the danger to Neng, and makes a strong case for evacuating the village. The old man is concerned that some villagers would prefer to stay and fight, as they did when the Sand Knights attacked. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Neng may be wary of strangers, but he's no fool. As you outline the danger in no uncertain terms, his face grows paler and paler in the moonlight. Finally he stops you and asks point blank what you think the village should do.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's unnerving to speak and hear someone else's voice, so you try to keep silent. Something is clearly wrong. You were supposed to observe history through Tash's eyes, had been warned *explicitly* not to act. But here you are in control, with no sign of Tash's consciousness. You can't just watch. Does this mean you have to do what Tash did? Are these decisions your own to make? What happens if you do something different?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Trying to puzzle out how someone else's memory works is no easy task. Memories aren't concise blocks of information, easily retrieved like books from a library. They're images, faces and sounds, smells, and meaning without words, all jumbled together. It probably makes sense to Tash, but for you, it's a struggle to assemble anything coherent from the soup of memories.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina doesn't like your suggestion, especially when it's taken up so heartily by the villagers. Win or lose, she worries that this option will lead to the most losses for the village.

But it's clear that most of the able-bodied villagers wanted to stay and fight - to "knock 'em back into the desert like those damned Sand Knights before." You're assured that the village is not without its own defenses.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The look of relief on Matkina's face is palpable when you make this recommendation. The villagers seem less enthused, and some openly accuse you of leading them into a trap for the Militia. Others feel evacuation is a coward's move, and want to defend their homes. Neng will have his hands full organizing a caravan in the scant hours remaining.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the villagers disperse to their own preparations, you and Matkina are left more or less alone in the dusty midnight square.

      <DefaultText>Matkina wants to protect Kholn Village, and is willing to betray the First to do so.

Tash's orders are to pose as Matkina's friend to keep an eye on her, and disable her if she turns against the Militia.

Before you left Sagus Cliffs, Matkina told you to just watch events unfold and find out about the Jahk - to fill in the parts of her memory that Tash wiped. </DefaultText>
