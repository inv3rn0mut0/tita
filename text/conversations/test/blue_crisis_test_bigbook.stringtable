      <DefaultText>The other animals appreciated the beaver's work, and knew it was important for their survival, but they kept adding more requirements to the dam.  "Build it higher," the deer would say.  "Make it longer," said the fox.  "Can you make it in the shape of a kitten?" asked the rabbit.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The beaver nodded that he could do all of those things, but cautioned that they would increase the time it would take to complete the dam.  "Go ahead and do it," insisted the shaggy wolf, "We have plenty of time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The beaver complained that the new requirements added by the forest creatures had increased the construction time of the dam by too long.  He could not finish it before the rains.

"Don't worry," the antelope assured him, "we will have more beavers to help you very soon."

The beaver nodded at this and continued his work.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>However, after several weeks had passed, and no new beavers had joined the project, he began to worry.  Each time he asked where the new beavers were, he was told they would be there "soon."

Concerned by the futility of his overt complaints, the beaver scrawled his worries into a trunk embedded into the dam.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As time went on, the new beavers never arrived.  The lone, stalwart beaver worked day and night to prepare the dam, but was unable to build it in time.

When the rains came, a torrent of angry, howling, fanatical water drenched the creatures of the forest, and everyone died.</DefaultText>
