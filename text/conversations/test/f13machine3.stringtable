      <DefaultText>This jeweled ebony statue stands with its angular, alien head thrown back, though whether in pain or in joy is impossible to tell. Its four arms are thrown akimbo, reaching in no particular direction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The statue's arms remain in disarray, and its tortured pose looks to be a subtle reproof of your failure to fix it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The statue's splayed limbs look a little like a crucifixion, and it seems to glare angrily at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grasp the lower left arm and begin to push, pull, and bend. At last you manage to apply the proper torque, and as you rotate and push it backward, the other arms spread in unison as if they were all on a single track. The statue groans under the stress, but at last it stands, its arms splayed. 

As it reaches this configuration, a beam of coherent light spills across the rift behind it.

There might have been a better way to do this, but your method was effective enough.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a slight hairline crack at the base and joints of each limb. Probing further, it looks like the slightest pressure on one of these results in an equal reaction in the other limbs, but they appear to be locked into place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take hold of the lower right limb of the statue and rotate its hand back and forth, back and forth. The increasing freedom of movement in the joint is reflected in the hands on the other limbs. Drawing confidence from this, you move up the arm and repeat the operation on the elbow, and then the shoulder. At last, you push the arm into place, and the limbs of the statue are outspread, as if in triumph... and a beam of light fires across the rift.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your eyes rove over the statue, looking for anomalies. Its dark surface makes it difficult to pick out details, and so you step closer. Finally, stepping up on your tiptoes, you see a small protrusion near the base of the neck. You push it and hear an audible click in the guts of the statue. The arms rotate of their own accord, whirring smoothly into place, splaying out into a wide X, and a beam of solid light rockets across the rift.</DefaultText>
