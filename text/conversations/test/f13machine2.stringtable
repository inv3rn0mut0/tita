      <DefaultText>This squat, toad-like statue exudes an air of alien intent, a strange construct that wears a crown of drooping, lifeless tendrils. One of the tendrils twitches feebly, and each time it does it emits a weak burst of light, which glides out over the chasm before disappearing. The statue's mouth is open, wide enough to reach into, and its clawed feet dig deep into the material that makes up the floor of this eerie place. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lighting is poor, and it's difficult to make out details, but it looks like there's a group of metallic rods in the back of the thing's...throat. One of those rods looks like it's misaligned.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Through deft maneuvering and gentle nudges, you managed to push the rod back into its proper place. The statue's mouth begins to close, but not before you pull your arm out and see that the rods have begun to transmit a glow to the statue's tendrils. They wave and hum, gathering light from the air, and a bridge of light slowly emerges from its backside.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tendrils are about half a meter long and as thick around as one of your fingers. They're made of some sort of fibrous material, a metallic foam that allows them to writhe and move. But apart from the one that twitches and flares occasionally, none of them are doing so.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Striking the statue squarely on its head seems to do the trick. The tendrils bounce into the air, a deep humming emanates from the statue's chest, and a coruscating energy field forms amid the writhing field of tentacles. A bridge of coherent light slowly slides from the statue's backside, bridging the chasm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tendrils bounce a little, and the statue's head seems to sink. There's a buzzing noise from deep within it, but it fades after a moment and nothing else happens.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You examine the small tracery of metal lines extend into the statue's skull, radiating outward to contact each tendril. A piece of the lattice has lifted slightly, breaking the circuit. You push it gently into place and a flare of energy radiates along the web. Tendrils bounce into the air, a deep humming purrs from the statue's chest, and a wide beam of coherent light slowly slides from the statue's backside, bridging the chasm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your fingers brush the item, and through careful and gentle manipulation, you move it slowly into a position where you can grasp it. You withdraw your arm, and you see a smooth, egglike shell about the size of your palm. It warms to your touch, and you feel it whirring in your palm. Wires and bolts of various sizes withdraw quickly, and then extrude. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Perhaps more importantly to you, the statue's tendrils bounce into the air, and a field of energy plays about their tips. A moment later, a bridge of coherent energy slides from the statue's back across the chasm with a low hum.</DefaultText>

It warms to your touch, and you feel it whirring in your palm. Wires and bolts of various sizes withdraw quickly, and then extrude. 

For a brief moment, the device splays open on your palm, revealing its inner workings to you entirely, and then it closes again.</DefaultText>

      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>Each of the one-meter struts is actually like a scroll - thin metal rods that pull apart, with a silvery netting of incredible tensile strength between them. If connected, these could perhaps create a long bridge suitable for some of the chasms in this room. The ends of the struts seem to have a rotating-gear mechanism attached to them, but you don't see any immediate way to connect them together.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the proper manipulation - twisting, turning, and pulling - and some fortuitous placement of the struts, you manage to assemble a strange device. When you pull the rods to the side, that silvery mesh creates a walkable surface. Shake it forward, you've got a bridge about five meters long. Snap it back, and it collapses into an easily carried single strut. You're the proud owner of a collapsible bridge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something swims to the front of your mind: it's a collapsible bridge, one of the creations of the ancients. You just have to connect the struts in a certain order with the proper twists and turns, and you'll have a bridge that looks like it span about five meters.

You do this, and now you are the proud owner of a collapsible bridge.</DefaultText>
