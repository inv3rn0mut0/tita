      <DefaultText>You didn't notice while the First was speaking, but Matkina's eyes are staring at one of the First's companions. She actually looks *frightened*. If it's at all possible, she looks paler than normal. "Tash."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Now that she says his name, it's obvious. This is the man whose body you inhabited in Matkina's merecaster so long ago. His only reply is a leering grin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She lifts the talisman in her hand, examining its shining surface. "Our freedom is finally at hand, thanks to you." She laughs to herself softly, as though to some inside joke. "I have no doubt you have questions - from what I hear, you *always* have questions. Ask them. Then let's celebrate our freedom together."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sets her shoulders strong. "You're *his* talisman, the catalyst he created to activate the chamber. Except he would use it to subsume all of us into himself - to *kill* us, do you understand? I have been trying to stop that from happening ever since I learned what our sire's true plans *were*. Then when you spoke to Mazzof in Ossiphagan - using poor Zerian's body - I knew he was close. I knew where you would appear, but not when. I've been watching Miel Avest ever since, waiting for you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>She crosses her arms. "When you escaped the sanctuary, I panicked. Years of planning undone! But then you came here, to me. The trip to the Heart was a fool's errand, you know. Whether you succeeded or not, I would have what I need - either you'd be dead, and our sire's plans with you, or else I'd have my talisman and his plans would no longer matter."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I had no choice. With the chamber and talisman out of my control, you were too dangerous to let live. Do you understand? He doesn't think of us as individuals, as people. He would have snuffed us *all* without a second thought! Even now, I find myself wondering whether I should annihilate you, just to be on the safe side." She takes a deep breath. "A few casualties for the sake of all of us? That is worth the risk to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "If they had any courage, any care for the plight of their siblilngs, they would be out *there* fighting against our sire. I would have found them, taken them into my fold as I took in so many." Her voice trails off.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her voice lowers. "But of course our sire doesn't want to *sever* that connection. He wants to *use* it to draw all castoffs back into himself, snuffing us out." She lowers her chin menacingly. "I *won't* let that happen."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It is. The Changing God rejected the talisman as a catalyst when he could not steal it from the ghibra - he *abandoned* Mazzof to their prison and began seeking a new means to activate the chamber. We discovered that means was *you* when you spoke to Mazzof through Zerian Daywalker. Your body was designed to control the Tidal connection between us, perhaps even better than this talisman can."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course it can. Mazzof has repaired the machine, not broken it further." Her voice gains a sharp edge to it. "But rest assured, if you go anywhere *near* that chamber, I will kill you myself."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks to Mazzof. You can't read the man's expression, but the First says, "Perhaps. But that would be foolish. Whatever our sire's plans for it, the chamber is our only hope of stopping the Sorrow."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <DefaultText>"The Sorrow tracks us with the Tides. In severing the Tidal connection between us - the Labyrinth, our sire called it - we will no longer be connected to the Tides.

      <DefaultText>"There is one other way." She chuckles darkly. "Our sire's way - suck every living castoff back into a single body. But what good is that? No. The only way to stop the Sorrow is to remove what it seeks. It hunts us because our bodies abuse the Tides. In severing the connection, that abuse will end."

She scoffs. "Our sire didn't know what he was doing when he made our bodies. The Sorrow is the consequence. But we can undo his mistakes."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sighs, frustrated, but not at you. "When I rescued Mazzof from the ghibra, we did what our sire could not, liberating the talisman from their Menagerie. I kept it with me, in the fortress, for many years. It was safe... or so I thought."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her voice grows hard. "The Bloom turned on me without warning, or perhaps there were signs I missed. It devoured a large chunk of the fortress, and the talisman with it. I have worked to keep it out ever since, but it was too late. The talisman was gone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "A decade? More? I rescued Mazzof from the ghibra after our sire abandoned him. The Bloom's hatred of the Sorrow, and it's power to keep it at bay, was known to me, so we came here in disguise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When the Bloom began turning against the old Memovira, I saw an opportunity. I needed his resources to find the resonance chamber before our sire found a way to activate it." She chuckles. "Now the Bloom is turning against me. Typical. But it won't matter soon."</DefaultText>

      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her voice cuts with a sharp edge. "Do you think I called my men here to brag? We'll kill you before you get near that chamber. The only reason I haven't yet is because I'm optimistic - I hope you're *smarter* than that."</DefaultText>
