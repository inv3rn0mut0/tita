{GEORGE: Her phermones and vocal technique feel like they double up conceptually - they both help her to calm to people.  I'd recommend cutting one of them to keep this conversation cleaner. The vocal technique would be my choice to cut due to current design of being able to learn it, which potentially has a bunch of issues.}</DefaultText>
