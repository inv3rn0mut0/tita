      <DefaultText>"So I took their advice. I came to Sagus Cliffs. I made myself a name. I built my reputation and my organization. But I made some enemies.

"Yes. He was living in a cave in the wastes. He blamed me for his situation. Said I'd made him act a way he never would have on his own. Then he tried to attack me."

The creeping paranoia that it's coming for you. Slow urgency mounts, and you start to feel like you need to lash out. But what I do... I run. I leave, and I don't come back. Try to throw off whatever scent it's picked up. And after a while, the pressure eases, and I can come back again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't try to go somewhere 'safe', like Miel Avest. It'll find me eventually. It always finds us. The best we can do is postpone the inevitable." Her voice sharpens. "Unless we figure out a way to kill it."</DefaultText>

She shivers slightly. "It comes for each of us. Like we're calling to it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>114</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Exactly. We're not real to them. We're supernatural beings, so everything we do is fraught with purpose. I blow my nose near them, they'll run to study the meaning in the snot instead of offering me a handkerchief. It doesn't mean anything, but they insist on treating every sniffle as an omen. Idiots. Anyway. What did you want to talk about?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Let me put that to rest right now - they see us as avatars. To them, we don't have feelings or ambitions, except for those our creator placed in us. I've had this conversation with them, and they treated every word like a revelation. I wasn't saying anything particular, in their minds but it was all epiphanies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He's a greedy, manipulative, domineering fool. I've heard he's also quite charming, witty, and an absolute genius. I suppose he'd have to be, given how long he's managed to keep ahead of the Sorrow. But I've never met him, so far as I know, so the only judgment I have on the man is what I've heard from others."</DefaultText>
