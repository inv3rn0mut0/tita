      <DefaultText>The holographic panel appears to be a control interface. In the center is what looks like a utility map of Sagus Cliffs. It's surrounded by a number of symbols you cannot immediately identify, and in the upper-right quadrant is some sort of cube within a cube.

Strange as the panel is, you can't shake a strong sense of familiarity about it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A utility map of Sagus Cliffs lies in the center of this control interface. A variety of strange symbols surround it, and an impossible cube within a cube sits in the upper-right corner.

Strange as it is, the whole thing feels very familiar.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The map of Sagus has a number of locations highlighted, some of which you recognize. There are four symbols around it: a circle that looks like the sun, a cluster of stars, a triangle of three eyes, and what looks like a crystal lattice. All the symbols are lit except for the crystal lattice.

Larger than all four symbols is the cube within a cube - which you suddenly remember is called a tesseract. It appears to be moving.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a map of Sagus with several highlighted points. Four symbols are next to the map: a sun, a cluster of stars, three eyes, and a crystal lattice.

In the upper-right is a large tesseract.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A memory tickles the edge of your mind but remains stubbornly unclear. You remember enough, though, to know that this panel controls a number of generators throughout the city, and that your earlier guess at the purpose of each symbol is certainly correct.

Aha! You remember now: the tesseract slips the controls between "space" and "time." This determines which set of machines the panel controls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A memory tickles the edge of your mind but remains stubbornly unclear. You do, however, remember what the symbols mean.

The sun activates the platform. The cluster of stars attempts to connect a network of machines. The three eyes inspects the status of the network and then, if repairs are needed, the crystal lattice will attempt to repair them.

The tesseract is some kind of toggle, shifting the controls from one state to another, but you can't remember the nature of those states.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The platform hums. The air pops and sizzles. For a few seconds, activity outside the platform *shifts*. People flicker in and out. Caravanserai changes, first the ships and then the buildings themselves. You see them as old and deteriorated, then new, then under construction on the bare rock, all within seconds. Your platform remains steady, but *outside*, as if time is shifting as swiftly as the sea.

      <DefaultText>A four-winged bird flaps desperately, trying to avoid the sphere, but its momentum is too great. It hits the sphere, disappearing with a cut-off squawk.

Far below in Caravanserai, you see the same bird tumble to the ground. It stands up, disoriented, then flaps its wings and takes off again.

      <DefaultText>With unfamiliar gestures, you rotate the tesseract. The inner cube squeezes out and becomes the outer cube, while the outer cube becomes the inner one.

Some of the locations lit up on the map change. Among other locations, two new lights appear in Caravanserai, one marking the platform where you're standing.

The outer cube moves in space, no longer flickering as it was before. Presumably, the controls are now set to the spatial dimension.

      <DefaultText>The bright points on the map grow even brighter, and the platform beneath your feet hums with a growing warmth.

Thin strands of energy - barely visible in the sunlight - stretch across the city between each location on the map. At the same time, faded lines appear on the map connecting each point, a network of generators which this panel controls.

Then with a loud pop, the energy fades, the humming stops, and everything returns to the way it was.

{ADAM/GEORGE: Put a ShouldNotPlay() on this for now so we can evaluate if there's a way to add this option here while maintaining consistency with the other shield generators. If we keep this, it'd be nice to add something visual to the level at the spot where the party teleports. -JF}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are at a cracked door at the base of a stairwell. The door squeaks quietly as you ease it open. Your breath catches in your throat, but the Tabaht soldiers outside don't notice you. You squeeze through the door, a keen-eyed young girl behind you, and slip out of the tower down the bloodstained corridor and into the city.

The city is under attack. You dash through the streets to the nearest of your generators. Pressing a couple of buttons, you and the girl are teleported elsewhere.</DefaultText>

With quick movements, you shift the tesseract, slipping the controls from "space" to "time." Then you press the cluster of stars to connect the network of temporal shield generators.

On the map, the network of generators bursts to life, sharing energy across the city to create an enormous shield over all of Sagus Cliffs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dome of energy fills the sky, unmooring the city from time itself. On the other side of the shield, the world shifts and shimmers, objects and landscape appearing and disappearing before your eyes. The place is the same, you realize, but you're seeing it in many different time periods at once.

The important thing is that no one can enter or exit the dome while the city is temporally unmoored. That should buy the city's defenders the space they need to fight off the Tabaht and survive.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The panel appears to monitor and maintain networks of machines, though the purpose of those networks is a mystery. Still, you can guess what the symbols mean.

The sun probably activates a single location, likely this platform, while the cluster of stars attempts to connect the entire network.

The triangle of eyes is to inspect something, maybe the status of the network. The crystal lattice, you think, indicates repairs. It would probably light up if it was needed.</DefaultText>
