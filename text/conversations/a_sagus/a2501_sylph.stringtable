      <DefaultText>This pretty young woman stands unnaturally still. Suddenly, her large, glassy eyes spring to life with a rattle and quickly lock with yours, before just as quickly snapping away. Her skin, as fair as porcelain, is cracked beneath several layers of dirt and faded makeup, and on the side of her neck you see what appears to be a small tattoo of vertical lines with glyphs etched at the bottom. 

For a moment familiarity overwhelms you, disappearing as a minute shudder runs down her arms.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her gaze snaps back to your face, but not to your eyes - she's staring at your tattoo. Jerkily, her hand rises to touch her own.

"Well met. I am called... Sylph." You note the slight pause before she pronounces her name. Her voice has a purring quality under which you can hear the spinning of countless gears. She coughs, just once, and a small greenish cloud emerges from between her lips. "How did you come by that mark?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear an echo of yourself and see in front of you a strange old man, gnarled by time and rabid with expectation. On his neck, weathered and sagging, you see the same series of vertical lines etched into his skin, a faded map to a time or a place that no longer exists.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She regards you, head tilting to the side with a series of small ratcheting noises. You have the absurd impression the motion is meant to be flirtatious. "I hope you will answer another question for me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear an excited clicking and her eyes flutter closed briefly. "I appreciate your honesty," she says, the manic working of gears sounding from deep within her chest.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>For a moment, all of her movement ceases, even the perpetual whirring of internal gears. The sudden silence is unnerving, though it lasts only a second before she comes back to life. Her hands move jerkily toward you, then away again, while inside her head mechanisms click and whirr.

"Interesting," she says in a voice you don't recognize.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>She says nothing for several moments, her irises contracting and expanding in a rapid shuttering motion. "Uncertainty acknowledged," she says eventually.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her mouth opens and you catch a glimpse of mottled machinework behind porcelain teeth. She breathes in sharply, then lets the air back out with a barely audible wheeze.

"Uncertainty acknowledged," she says.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Why shouldn't we be personal? We're both consenting adults." One of her eyes shudders closed in a wink. It takes some seconds and the labored whirring of gears before it will open again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her voice takes on a more eloquent tone, deeper and richer than you've heard  from her before. "I wonder if you might have heard this old riddle before." She clears her throat and begins, as if reciting from memory:

"What comes in with breath and out with a word, transmutes upon death but can't be conferred?"

The words sound vaguely familiar, resonating in your mind even after she's stopped speaking.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have a riddle that it may please you to answer," she says, brushing her hair coquettishly back from her bare shoulders. "It is very old." She pauses a moment, then recites from memory:

"What comes in with breath and out with a word, transmutes upon death but can't be conferred?"

The words sound vaguely familiar, resonating in your mind even after she's stopped speaking.</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>The timbre of her voice changes, dropping an octave to a more eloquent tone. "Since you are a self-admitted god, this old riddle should prove no challenge to you." She clears her throat and begins, as if reciting from memory:

"What comes in with breath and out with a word, transmutes upon death but can't be conferred?"

      <DefaultText>"An adequate answer," she says, "but incorrect." She raises one hand to form a curious sign with her fingers. When she goes to release it, however, her index finger stays frozen in place, and it takes her some moments to disengage it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do we all live in glory, then?" She seems to be giving the thought serious consideration. "Even if some would say we do not truly breathe?" You hear the wheezing of her lungs and realize the sound had been mostly absent until now. She breathes a few more times then suddenly stops, her eyes snapping back to your face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sylph stares at you for an uncomfortably long time. She raises shaking hands toward you and this time doesn't pull back, her cracked porcelain fingers constricting around your upper arms.

"It *is* you," she says fervently, in that deeper voice. "Have you returned to see what better minds than yours have wrought?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I hadn't taken you for a mystic," Sylph sneers, then blinks, eyes whirring closed for several seconds.

"My pardon," she says. "I hope you will not take offence."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Try to remember where you've heard the riddle before.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>You listen again to her words, feel the echo and weight of them moving in your mind. You see Sylph, garbed in the robes of an Aeon Priest, her face in shadow. But when the riddle comes, it's in your voice, not hers, and the rhyme is different:

"It arrives with first breath and leaves with each word, transfigured by death unless it's conferred."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>The words sound familiar, but something about them is subtly wrong. Just when you think you've grasped the difference it slips from your mind, and you're left with only Sylph's expectant gaze.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>In your mind, Sylph replies in a deeper, melodious tone.

"Consciousness."

It isn't until you surface from the memory to find Sylph staring at you that you realize you spoke the word aloud.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am flattered to have the topic arise in my presence." She makes a shaky bow from which it's uncertain she'll recover, but she manages to right herself with only a subtle internal protest of shearing metal.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Query - is this a pessimistic viewpoint, or a positivist one? Is it that nothing can be taught, or everything can be taught?" She turns her head from side to side, as if to shake loose the thought that has gotten stuck in her mind.

"I must abandon this line of reasoning," she concludes, ceasing her motion. "I hope I do not offend."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Honesty?" She looks past you, her gaze going distant. There's a momentary sense that she's conferring within the chamber of her own thoughts. She opens her mouth and breathes in once.

"Probability is high," she says, though whether to you or herself is unclear. "We shall continue."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>

      <DefaultText>She laughs at the look on your face. It's not a pleasant sound. "And to think! All those years ago you had the audacity to call yourself a god! Look at me! Look at *this*!" She spreads her arms and turns in a circle, clearly intending you to see every angle of her body.

"This is the pinnacle of a lost civilization!" she gloats, the void behind her eyes replaced with fervent, furious madness. "My perfect immortal vessel, and I'm the one who discovered it! Me!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have one last question to ask of you. You may not have an answer." She looks beyond you, remaining still for some moments while the gears inside her stomach clatter and whirr. Then she meets your gaze again and asks her question.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You are uncertain of many things." She tilts her head, regarding you with birdlike curiosity. "Is this an essential aspect of your mortality?" She places her hands over where her heart should be.

"Perhaps you do not know this either. And if that is so, you will not help me." Listlessly, she lowers her arms and averts her gaze seeming, oddly, disappointed.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then you are a mystery to yourself as well," she says, and gives a slight bow. "You are not the person I seek. My condolences."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then you are not the person I seek." Sylph's voice is a perfect example of contempt. "Be on your way. I have no use for you."

Her expression clears, and she bows slightly. "I apologize, but I have no more questions to ask," she says in her metallic burr.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That would doubtless be difficult." The darkness behind her eyes whirls with glints of metal as her pupils dilate fully. They snap back to normal, and she bows slightly. "I wish you luck in your endeavor. I have no more questions for you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An image appears in your mind of Sylph standing demurely beside a richly-clothed man who gestures at you impatiently.

"Sure, she's old, but she can still work. Still got that machine intelligence of hers running along nicely, unlike some others," he says. "If you're lonely, she'll keep you company. If you're not, she'll keep quiet. Won't you?" He turns his piercing gaze on Sylph, who nods.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A sharp edge of disappointment - you recall walking away from Sylph when she was offered to you, passing a sneering man in dark robes who had already made an offer. His presence overwhelms the memory with a sudden understanding of who and what stands in front of you. Edden, an obsessive Aeon Priest, who made it his personal mission to track the Changing God to the ends of this world, searching for a way to transfer his self into vessels of his choosing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You study her cracked porcelain skin, the way her joints are covered by the seams in her clothing, and what once must have been a remarkably pretty face. 

You recall a fragment of ancient machine history, discovered by your sire in a place called the Weal of Baz. Automatons like Sylph were created in many different shapes to please their owners - no two alike, all hand-crafted and unique. Only a few survivors were known to the machine minds of Baz, and those went for sale to the highest bidder.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It seems he succeeded, at least partially. But one look at Sylph's decaying body tells you that he has merely exchanged one prison for another, with no hope of salvation any time soon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's impossible to tell how successful the transfer was or how intertwined their two psyches may have become. Regardless, the two of them are trapped in the same decaying construct, with no hope of salvation any time soon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She spits, bright green froth that lands in the dust at your feet. "That, to your 'help.' My methods are beyond your comprehension, and I'm going to make sure they stay that way!"

The light fades from her eyes as suddenly as it arrived. She blinks at you with a chittering of decaying cogs, folding her hands in front of her and executing a small bow.

"I do not know what transpired," she says. "Please accept my apologies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It seems likely that Sylph started her life as one of these abandoned constructs, having somehow retained her consciousness despite supposed deactivation. For good or ill she is now her own person and, from the sound of her inner workings, one with an expiration date.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sylph is standing where you left her, hands clasped tidily in front of her. She seems lost in thought, the delicate machinery inside her head clicking and whirring as she stares into the middle distance. Familiarity almost overwhelms you, replaced by the conviction that you've seen her in some place and some when else other than Sagus Cliffs as they are now.</DefaultText>
