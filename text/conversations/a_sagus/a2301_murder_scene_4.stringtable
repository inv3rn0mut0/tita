      <DefaultText>A flayed hand lies at the center of the pool of blood. Its ragged stump points directly at the crimson circle painted on the nearby wall. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stump of the severed hand at the center of the pool points at center of the bloody circle on the wall, as though attached to it by an invisible arm. 

You get the oddest sense that if you watch the hand long enough, it will move. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The small hand lies open, palm facing the ceiling. Frantic knifework has mangled the fingertips. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The small hand lies open, palm facing the ceiling. Frantic knifework has mangled the fingertips. You cannot tell if these injuries occurred because Mechela was trying to defend herself, or if the killer was simply in a hurry.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pool of blood is crusted and nearly dry. The mangled hand is drying and curling into a fist, one finger at a time. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Haven't seen this is a while," she says softly, coming up beside you. "That's no simple circle. That's the symbol of the Children of the Endless Gate."

She snorts. "They're a sect of the Dendra O'Hur that kills people instead of eating them. They call it 'opening the cages'. The Dendra chased them out of the city a long time ago, but it doesn't look like they took the hint. Either that or..." She pauses, thinking. "One of the Dendra O'Hur got tired of waiting for people to die on their own."

      <DefaultText>Fresh blood streams over the circle, yanking you through the hollow at its center into the world beyond. 

A strip of blistered land coils through a void as black as a gaping mouth. The air is thick, foul, and textured with the slickness of maggots. Nausea slams into you, filling your head. Infecting your thoughts. 

And through it all, you sense a mind in that fathomless darkness, spilling towards yours, seeking, tasting. Joyful. Hungry. 
{SOUND: Wind with soft, gross slobbering behind it. Could be the same as the sounds the player hears in the Endless Gate scene.}</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>You shove the horrific memory away from you, slamming your mind shut like a door, and swallowing the knot of nausea in your throat. 

After seeing that world, the bloody pool at your feet seems almost mundane.</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>You slam your mind shut like a door. The memory claws at you, and for a moment, you see a world beyond the bloody circle - a blistered strip of land winding through a hungry void...

And then, the vision collapses, leaving you breathless and weary.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You recognize the shapes slashed on the wall. It is both a transdimensional doorway and the symbol of the Children of the Endless Gate, a breakaway sect of the Dendra O'Hur.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your hand reaches toward the streaks and bubbles of blood of its own accord, and an iron spike drives through your temples. 

You stand before a blank wall. Sickening purple-black light spills around the corner behind you. This is *your* temple and you have been driven into a dead end. By *her*.

Blood seeps through the wall from the other side, drawing the familiar shape. Frightened, confused, you trace the line... and a gate opens with a wet *crunch*...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You study the dashes and bleeding pinpricks decorating - *binding* - the circle. They aren't symbols in any known human tongue, but you sense their purpose. 

The circle was almost inconsequential. These sigils *gripped* the shape of it and *pushed* it through time and space. This was, however briefly, a transdimensional portal to another place. Now it is dead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If anything, the circle on the wall - the transdimensional gate - seems dimmer than it was before.</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>It is immediately clear that the dashes and bleeding pinpricks decorating this circle are not random. This is a symbol, drawn with careful intent. 

Unfortunately, it means nothing to you. </DefaultText>
