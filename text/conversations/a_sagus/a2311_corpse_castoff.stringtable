      <DefaultText>You carefully move the shroud to the side. 

There's no way around it. This dead man was a castoff - and it would be hard for him to be deader. His flesh is papery, desiccated. His tattoo - or rather, the charred remains of it - has burned through his skin and into the bone beneath.  

And, of course, there is the matter of his charred eye sockets, and his horrified, gaping mouth. 

Parts of the corpse are missing, remnants of an aborted Dendra feast. You aren't surprised they stopped. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Again, your eyes are drawn to the remnants of the castoff's tattoo. It looks like it burst into flame when he died, burning right through his skin into the skull beneath. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The last thing you remember before your fingertip grazes the tattoo is a rising buzz...

Time stutters and breaks.
 
Panting softly, you awaken, leaning against the bier for support. Your arm burns, your temples throb, and white static claws at the corners of your vision. 

Someone was screaming in that lightless, timeless void. You remember that much. But it wasn't you - none of the Dendra are looking your way.</DefaultText>
