"Then I saw the Dendra O'Hur. Saw the way people respect them even if you could break most of 'em in half with two hands. I thought that maybe there was room for a man to grow here." He grins.

He scowls. "I didn't get a word. I saw a memory of his when I was picking him out of my teeth. He was lying in bed, dying maybe, waiting for his son to come see him. His eyes kept closing, closing, an' his son never came." 

He shakes his head like a beast trying to dislodge a biting insect. "Not that I saw, anyway. And that's from just *one* meal."</DefaultText>

He chuckles. "He was smart an' knew it. Always looking down on the rest of us. Always ordering people around with Fulsome looking on, smiling." He snorts. 

"But if you're thinking I chopped him, I didn't. I was getting drunk in a corner of the manufactory." He grins nastily. "Wondering what all the screaming was about."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You know who you should ask," he says, leaning in. "Kiyatawa. I saw her hunched over some corpse in an alley, all by herself. Doesn't matter what the meat is - people who eat on their own always got something to hide."

He nods at the other cultist. "An' Gh'zei's one to watch too. She ain't like you or me. She's a mutant, an' not one of the nicer ones."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"People? She said that?" He shoots a dark look at Kiyatawa. 

"Yeah, all right, but not 'people'," he says, stretching his thick neck. "It was just the one. Someone - yeah, I ain't gonna give you a name - who stole something from me once. And the fact that you ain't here asking about *him* means no one misses him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You must think I'm an idiot," he says. "Sometimes, grudges pay off, right? Make you feel good, right in your gut." He slaps his belly.

"But no one - *no one* - ever gets the better of Fulsome. Even if I killed every one of his proteges - and I'm not saying I killed even one - the man would have me skinned and hung before I dropped my club."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Huh," he says, chuckling. "You should have seen Kiyatawa running out of here just before Fulsome's people came. Thought she was so clever. Better than the rest of us. But she wasn't smarter than you, yeah?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What I did..." Tybir says, scratching his jaw. "What I did. Oh! You're talking about how I told everyone you killed your partner for less than the cost of dinner?" He smiles, but his eyes are cold. "I'd do it again, and for free."
