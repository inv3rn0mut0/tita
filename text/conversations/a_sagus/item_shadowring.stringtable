      <DefaultText>Ever so slowly, you force the ring fragments together, pushing your way through the massive force repelling them. The closer you bring Areph and Vareth together, the more they seem to resist. Beads of sweat form on your forehead and your muscles scream in agony, but then finally the moment you force the rings to touch, the repelling force completely dissipates and the two fragments eagerly latch on to each other.

The complete Shadow Ring lies in the palm of your hand, simmering with barely restrained power.</DefaultText>

It is now obvious why it was not reforged previously, as only a castoff or a nearly superhuman effort could have done so.
