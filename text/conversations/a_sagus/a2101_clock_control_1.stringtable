      <DefaultText>Circus Minor looks almost completely different. All the people are dressed strangely, and though they speak the Truth, they use many terms and phrases that you don't understand.

The square has changed as well. All of the tents are gone. The buildings are more colorful and less weathered. One building in particular rises from the edge of the square - a tower of purple rock some fifty stories high. A mural is painted on the side, though you can't see the details from here.</DefaultText>

The tents are gone. The buildings are more colorful and less weathered. A fifty-story building made of purple rock rises straight up from the edge of the square.

If you had to guess, you'd say this is what Sagus Cliffs looked like centuries ago.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As soon as you focus on them, you feel a warmth on your head where your tattoo is. The images respond to your thoughts, slowing and changing at your whim. It's something about your body that allows you to do this, which perhaps means that only you can even see the images.

You immediately recognize the pictures as pieces of memory - specifically the three memories you saw back in the fathoms of your mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you lock the third image, the air around the device trembles. The other devices in the square begin to glow, as though they're about to do something.

Just as suddenly, the glow on all three devices fades. The image you had locked to this device flickers, and then the three memories flit across its surface once more. The device seems to have reset itself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A glowing, viscous fluid flows up from the ground to the top of a chamber inside the device. Sifting through the synth shards, you find pieces of a filigreed grating - diamonds within diamonds. It's been shattered into several pieces by your blow, making the remnants hard to find. Fixtures around the sides of the chamber suggest that the grating was attached in the midst of the fluid, perhaps as some kind of sieve.

The grating is too shattered to fix, but perhaps you could find a replacement.

But the clock becomes solid. It no longer appears to be in multiple time periods at once.

As the clock returns to solidity, a strange thing happens to the sky. The sun races to the horizon and disappears, and Circus Minor is enveloped in darkness. Oddly, buildings in the distance - beyond the edges of the district - still appear sunlit.</DefaultText>
