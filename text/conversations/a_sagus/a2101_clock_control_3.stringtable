      <DefaultText>A glowing, viscous fluid flows up from the ground to the top of a chamber inside the device. Sifting through the synth shards, you find pieces of a filigreed grating - diamonds within diamonds. It's been shattered into several pieces by your blow, making the remnants hard to find. Fixtures around the sides of the chamber suggest that the grating was attached in the midst of the fluid, perhaps as some kind of sieve.

The grating is too shattered to fix, but perhaps you could find a replacement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Inside the hole is a kind of glowing, viscous fluid. It seems to be flowing *up* from the ground and collecting at the top of the inner chamber.

      <DefaultText>Applying a little force, you fit the lattice underneath the fixtures where the filigreed grating had been attached. The viscous fluid holds the lattice against them.

Immediately, the fluid glows more brightly, but the device itself remains dark. Perhaps something needs to be done to the clock as well, in order to restore Circus Minor to a daytime state.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach this device, Circus Minor is thrown into chaos. Buildings are on fire. People are screaming and running for their lives, while armored soldiers hunt them. None of them seem to pay any attention to you, though. It's some kind of vision... not reality.

You glance down at the device. A series of images flit across its surface. They don't appear related to the changes around you. You see faces of other people and places, all of them familiar.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The device goes dark. The images are gone, and so are the weird echoes of Circus Minor's past. You've definitely broken it. Around the cultists' encampment, the other two devices darken as well.

But the clock becomes solid. It no longer appears to be in multiple time periods at once.

As the clock returns to solidity, a strange thing happens to the sky. The sun races to the horizon and disappears, and Circus Minor is enveloped in darkness. Oddly, buildings in the distance - beyond the edges of the district - still appear sunlit.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Circus Minor is under attack. Squads of armored soldiers roam the streets, hunting and killing anyone they find. Mobs of people flee in terror, with only a few hapless souls trying - and failing - to fight them off.

The soldiers are completely encased in jagged, metal armor. You can't even tell if they're human.

Looking beyond the carnage, the square in this vision looks wildly different. Many of the buildings that are on fire don't exist at all when you step away from the device, having been replaced by other structures.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As soon as you focus on them, you feel a warmth on your head where your tattoo is. The images respond to your thoughts, slowing and changing at your whim. It's something about your body that allows you to do this, which perhaps means that only you can even see the images.

      <DefaultText>As soon as you lock this third image, a final surge of energy arcs through the air from the device to the clock itself. The clock shines for a moment, then becomes solid, fixed into a single state.
