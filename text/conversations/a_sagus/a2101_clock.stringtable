Since their Fathom hasn't been implemented yet, you can choose your Focus here. (Note that you'll have more options in the final game).]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This complex machine towers over you. Its purpose is unclear, but the three circular faces set into the ground remind you of clocks. Something is wrong with the machine, however. It's partially transparent, shimmering in the air when you look directly at it. The clock faces seem to show several different times at once.

Humanoid silhouettes ripple beneath the central clock face. One places his hand against the face as though it were a glass wall. They seem to be watching you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The machine is solid now. Each of the three clock faces shows a single time - though none of them point to any time measurement that you understand.

You lean closer to the central clock face. Three shadowy figures still lurk within, their features almost discernible now...

Suddenly, the figures surge out of the clock toward you. Intense pressure strikes your head like a steel spike. Then everything goes black.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you pull your hand away, a memory strikes you as powerfully as if someone took a club to your chest...

You are working at the clock. It is no longer transparent but perfectly solid.

There is a noise behind you. So they've come, the three traitors. They think to surprise you, but through the powers of the clock you have foreseen this moment.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Now that you've fixed the control device, Tidal energies tug at your body and mind. You could easily *push* the machine back into its previous state, unmoored in time. Doing so would probably reactivate the three devices around Circus Minor as well.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the last shreds of the memory fade, a swirl of energy passes through your body. Cold barbs prick every muscle. Suddenly Tidal forces arc from the clock to three ancient devices in the cultist encampment.

      <DefaultText>As you approach the clock, there is a pause in the argument the duo next to it are having. The petite woman turns toward you.

      <DefaultText>There is the faintest sound of metal sliding against leather. You slap a hand on the central clock face, activating the clock's arcane powers. You're not sure what it will do to them, but it's better than what they'll do to you.

There is a flash. Arcs of energy stretch out from the clock, over your shoulders to your would-be attackers. You don't see what happens to them, but they quickly disappear along with their screams.</DefaultText>
