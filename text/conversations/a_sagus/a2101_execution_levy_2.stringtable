      <DefaultText>"Regrettably, I cannot." The soldier's smile doesn't leave his face. "By order of the Slave Families, I must prevent anyone from approaching the condemned man." 

He gestures toward the wretched figure on the dais, who appears to be speaking nonsense as his body is slowly wrapped in rotting entrails. "You must be new to this city, to ask such a thing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Allow me to welcome you to Sagus Cliffs, Visitor." He speaks the final word like a title, almost an honorific. "I am a levy. You may rely upon me, and others like me, for protection and assistance... at the discretion of the Council and the Slave Families."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This man is large and broad-shouldered, and his steel armor is painted in the silver and indigo colors of Sagus Cliffs. He seems to be an ordinary soldier or constable of the city... too ordinary, perhaps. As you scan his face, you see that his features are plain, forgettable, almost generic.

Not only that... his eyes are a little too large, his smile too firmly fixed upon his face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This armored levy is almost a mirror image of his comrade who stands on the other side of the execution platform. You sense that something about them is subtly different, but at first glance, you can't quite determine what it is.

He nods and greets you in a remarkably similar voice. "Hello, Visitor."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am privileged to inform you that you cannot." The levy manages to make it sound like a piece of excellent news.

"If you wish to discuss the matter further, please direct your inquiry to the official in charge." He points to the indigo-clad man on the projecting edge of the dais.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Every citizen is required to raise a levy for the protection of the city.

      <DefaultText>"Yes. A year of life is taken from a citizen. The lost year is used to create a levy." He pauses ever so briefly, though his smile remains fixed in place. "That is why our lifespans are precisely one year long. When our spans are up, we degrade into our component matter."

"If you are curious about the process, I have been instructed to direct you to the Order of Truth, where you may observe the machine that is our... parent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A year is removed from a citizen's lifespan and used to create one of us. Anyone who wishes to become a citizen of Sagus Cliffs must make this sacrifice."

He regards you calmly, smiling as always. "Our own lifespans are only a single year - then we degrade into our component matter. If you wish to know more, you may inquire at the Order of Truth." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If you saw the face of this man on the streets of a city, you wouldn't glance at him twice - his features are utterly ordinary and forgettable, not too ugly, not too handsome. It is, indeed, almost like he is an *average* of many thousands of men, their idiosyncrasies and imperfections merged into a bland middle ground.

The exceptions, of course, are the eyes, which are just a bit too large for the face, and the fixed, ever-present smile. Taken together, the man's features give you a vague sense of unease.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>But wait... you *do* notice something unusual. Pinned to this levy's helmet is a tiny green branch with miniscule leaves. You might have assumed it was a twig that was blown there by the wind, but your sharp eyes catch a bit of twine that fastens it to the levy's helm.</DefaultText>

      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>The face of this levy is nearly identical to his comrade on the other side of the execution platform. If they're different, the variations are extremely subtle and random - a slight difference in the shape of the ears, perhaps, or a barely-discernible quirk of the lips when he smiles... as he does, constantly. Otherwise, the two men could be twins.

Actually, they are even less distinguishable than twins.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The levy's features are utterly ordinary and forgettable, as if he is the average of many thousands of men, their idiosyncrasies and imperfections merged into a bland middle ground.

      <DefaultText>His eyes flick up, then back to you. "It is... a reminder of the year that gave me life. It belonged to an old woman." He runs a hand over the twig.  "A little tree... the old woman's favorite little tree that she raised from a seed. No... *would* have raised. She wanted to become a citizen, but she had only one year left to give. The little tree was never born."

At the same moment, both you and the levy seem to notice that his smile is gone, and it instantly returns to his lips.</DefaultText>
