      <DefaultText>He clears his throat and directs your attention to a well dressed mannequin wearing the badge of a city official. "Also, it is our honor to have been chosen to provide the city of Sagus Cliffs with the official badges worn by all properly credentialed city employees. You may trust in their trust in us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you, Tybir, but that's asking too much of this gentleman. Perhaps we could mitigate the risk to him?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She stops here often, though she doesn't always buy something. I know little else about her, except that she is a chiurgeon who administers to children." He raises his eyebrows. "I don't think that's *all* she does - sometimes I see her speaking to strangers from elsewhere in the city - married couples, usually. It all seems very hush-hush, if you know what I mean."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stares at you and shakes his head. "Truly, Overseer Yeen is hiring almost anyone these days. There was a time when city officials were expected to *know* Sagus Cliffs." He tuts disapprovingly. "Never mind. You asked about Council Tower."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He tuts disapprovingly. "You say Overseer Yeen commissioned you? Truly, Yeen's standards are slipping dramatically. This should be basic knowledge for any civil servant."

      <DefaultText>He laughs softly. "Friend, you are no city official. All those questions you asked me betray your ignorance." He spreads his hands wide. "I bear you no ill will, but I cannot simply *give* you a city official's badge."</DefaultText>
