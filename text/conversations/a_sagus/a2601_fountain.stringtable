      <DefaultText>This fountain is constructed of a material that seems halfway between wood and stone. It doesn't contain water, as might be expected. Instead, it's filled with swarming, tiny fishlike creatures that leap and cavort in a wriggling mass, chattering to each other in what sounds like a thousand different tongues.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fishlike creatures in this woodstone fountain slip and leap over each, babbling in their many-faceted tongues. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These are jalleys, nearly harmless creatures that are usually found in clouds above the sea. What they're doing in this fountain is an utter mystery. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You fold your arms, listening intently to the fish jabber at each other. It sounds like a cloud of nonsense syllables mashed into baby-speak. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fishlike creatures continue to gibber a song of melodic syllables and broken words.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A few often-repeated sounds tug at your attention. This is no string of gibberish after all. They are speaking a variety of languages, but ones you've never heard before. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A few oft-repeated sounds tug at your memory until something unravels. 

You stand before a rusty intelligence terminal, surrounded by crooked ruins. Laying unfamiliar hands against the cracked glass, you speak words in all the languages you know. This takes some time.  

The terminal awakens at the sound of an ancient, guttural greeting. You recognize it immediately as one of the words the fishlike creatures are babbling cheerfully at each other. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fountain, now that you're looking at it, is unfathomably old. Coppery, tongue-like decorations curl up and over the rim of the structure, as if lapping at the endless stream of creatures within. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take in the surrounding architecture before returning your gaze to the fountain. The structure easily predates the buildings in this plaza and possibly the city. 

It might even be older than the Ninth World. </DefaultText>
