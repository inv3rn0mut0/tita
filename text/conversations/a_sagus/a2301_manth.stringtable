      <DefaultText>A look of panic flashes across his face, instantly replaced by a big grin and a hearty laugh. "Ha! Just a little nonsense phrase we used to say to each other back in Kiorkeryyn. You looked like a fellow I knew there, so I thought I'd see if you remembered it. Pay it no mind."

      <DefaultText>He snatches the coins and they disappear into his ragged shirt. "Much obliged. Now...." He rubs his beardless chin. "Where to start? You want to hear about the people who live here? Or maybe the sticha tunnels? Or the manufactory? Or those crazy Dendra O'Hur bastards?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "It's the bottom of the ladder. As they say around here, there ain't no more down to go. But that's a good thing, right? Means you've got nowhere to go but up."

A passing though dims his cheery expression. "Unless you drown, or something."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>He blows out his cheeks. "Well, I won't talk about everyone. There's a lot of us here, but I'll hit the highlights. Or lowlights, I guess."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He starts to count them off on his fingers. "There's Fulsome, of course. He runs things around here. Not officially, mind you. He's just the sharpest chagan with the hardest crew, is all. Mechela, who sells bits and bobs at her stall. Meuk the Meatmonger, who sells, uh... meat."</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>He pats his chest. "Tell Meuk I sent you if you pay him a visit. He gives me a shin for each referral. Uh, lets see. There's Aligern the Aeon Priest, who isn't anymore, but still knows his stuff. Mapper, crazy carker who's covered in maps, and..." He pauses, thinking.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head as if bewildered. "That's the hard plod right there. Folks you'd think were smart enough to know honest work is bad for you slaving away at those furnaces with giant contructs watching over 'em like metal slave drivers."

He shivers. "I've only looked in once. Scared the wits out of me, so I never went back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How now, helpmeet? Got any-" 

He stops as he sees Tybir with you. "Tybir!" he bellows. "Good to see you! Last I heard, you and Ris were running from the levies. Slipped 'em again, eh? This your new crew? Looking for an in and out man? I'm free at the moment, and ready and able to do some crimes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Manth, my boy, always joking!" he says through gritted teeth. "And so loudly!"

He puts an arm around the young man's neck and snugs him in - a little too tight. "Someday, someone going to hear one of your loud jokes and call the watch on you - and *me*. And no, this is not my new 'crew.' This is my *friend*, who I am helping find his way around the pitfalls of our great city."

Tybir turns to you. "Manth is actually the most honest boy in Sagus Cliffs, aren't you, Manth?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>For the briefest of seconds, Tybir looks like he wants to throttle the life out of the young man, then he laughs. "Manth, my boy, always joking!"

He puts an arm around the young man's neck and snugs him in - a little too tight. "If you're not careful, some law-abiding person is going to think you're serious and call the watch on you - and *me*. And no, this is not my new 'crew.' This is my *friend*, who I am helping find her way around the pitfalls of our great city."

      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>He swallows. "I... I... Why, yes, I am! They don't come much honester than Manth Pa! I pretty much just sit around all day, thinking of ways I could be more hon-"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tybir's meaty palm covers Manth's mouth. "That's fine, lad. That's fine."

He smiles at you. "You know, Manth has the most dangerous job in Sagus Cliffs. He's a window washer. Hangs out over the sea faces of those cliff houses and scrubs away without a care. And if that weren't enough, when he's not working, he's down here in the Underbelly, helping people find their way around. Go on, just ask him. He knows everything about the place."</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"-at's right," says Manth as Tybir lifts his hand. "Ask me anything. You want to hear about the people who live here? Or maybe the sticha tunnels? Or the manufactory? Or those crazy Dendra O'Hur bastards?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shoots Tybir a hard look, then clears his throat. "All right, all right. I'll tell you for free." He points. "Go south from here to the inlet. The murder happened in the little alcove just to the left as you're facing it."</DefaultText>
