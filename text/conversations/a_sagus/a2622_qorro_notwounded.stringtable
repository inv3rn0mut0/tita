      <DefaultText>"There you are," Qorro says. "I had no doubt you'd make it back in one piece. You being who you are."

His mouth twists. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To be frank, I considered killing you again." He snorts. "Then I remembered that you shook off death the first time. And Salimeri wouldn't approve."

He meets your eyes. "In all honesty... I need a favor."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To be frank, I considered ambushing you. But Salimeri... " He pauses, then forces the words out. "Salimeri cares for you."

He meets your eyes. "And In all honesty, I need a favor."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tell Salimeri I helped you," he says. "Please. She wants to dismiss me. Help me change her mind, and I'll tell you something I know about the Order of Truth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tell Salimeri I helped you," he says. "Please. I would have if I'd arrived in time, but you're just so damnably..." He trails off, taking a breath. 

"She wants to dismiss me. Help me change her mind, and I'll tell you something I know about the Order of Truth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fine," Qorro says without hesitation. "I'll give you something from my private collection, but only after you tell her. Will you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You seem awfully concerned about Salimeri's opinion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A good employer's hard to find, these days," he says, studying the air above your head.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I saw the way you looked at her. And me, when you learned she... knew me. You love her, don't you?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyes widen. Then his mouth firms. 

"Fine," he says. "I love her. There, I've said it. And I don't want to leave her side, even if she doesn't feel the same way."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But not impossible. Tell the truth, Qorro. Why do you care about her opinion so much?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Her opinion?" He laughs nervously. "No, I..." he trails off under your stare. 

"Fine," he says. "I love her. There, I've said it. And I don't want to leave her side, even if she doesn't feel the same way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, Qorro," she sighs. "She is utterly beyond your reach, my dear."

      <DefaultText>"Of course she is," Qorro says sharply. "That doesn't change a thing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tybir palms his face. 

"Oh, for the love of... I know at least thirty shape-shifters who charge *reasonable* hourly rates," he says. "And that's just off the top of my head. You don't need to stumble after a woman who has no interest in you. Have some pride, son."

      <DefaultText>"Pride," says Qorro, "is like free liquor. Hardly ever worth the cost."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh," Rhin says. "I think it's worse than that. She, um, doesn't seem to like you very much. At all."

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Her opinion?" He laughs nervously. "No. Her pay? Absolutely. Drinks can be found for free, but they're hardly ever worth the price."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All right."</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good," he says. "Will you tell her?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'll tell her you helped."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Excellent," Qorro says. "I'll hold you to that. Now, the secret, as promised."

He nods his companions toward the door. "Lan Uring," he says. "The boy is a spy for the Memovira. I'm not sure why - he loves the Order well enough. I was going to blackmail him, but..." 

He grins. "Priorities change, I suppose. I'll see you back at the Order, falling star."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I expected as much," Qorro says with a heavy sigh. "Give Salimeri my... my regards."

And without another word, he leaves.</DefaultText>
