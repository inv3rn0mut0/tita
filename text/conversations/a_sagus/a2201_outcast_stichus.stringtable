      <DefaultText>Partially hidden in the trash of the dump is a strange and frightened creature. It is covered in chitin like an insect, but its shell looks thin and soft, and its small and malformed claws seem half-grown. 

It stares at you from its hiding place and chitters incomprehensibly.</DefaultText>

It stares at you from its hiding place, chittering. Because of its physical deformities, you can barely understand its speech. "Don't hurt. Not tell."</DefaultText>

You see yourself interacting with a stichus, the two of you patiently exchanging hand signals, a small box between the two of you translating your words and thoughts.

      <DefaultText>The creature makes vague motions with its claws and emits a series of clicks and wet, guttural noises. Oddly, you smell dust and lightning. Some of the sounds are reminiscent of a human with digestive trouble, but you're fairly certain it's some form of language. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It weaves its head and clicks its claws, then pauses as if waiting for a response. The odor of ozone and stale air surrounds you. When you make no reply in its language, it shakes its head vigorously and 'says' nothing more.</DefaultText>
