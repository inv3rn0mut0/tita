      <DefaultText>The elderly man stares vacantly at a distant wall, muttering under his breath. His hands flex on the air, twisting and tweaking, as if he is repairing a machine only he can see. 

He jumps when you draw in a breath to speak. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ha! Spotted you before you could sneak up on me again," he says, flashing his gums. "What do you need?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes? What?" he says. His eyes rove past you, halt, then return to focus on your face with some effort. 

"Ain't you a quiet one!" he says cheerfully. "The Under-Foreman makes more noise than you! We should hang chimes from your ears to keep you from surprising people. What do you need?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He clasps your hands in his cold ones.

"Thank you for convincing my master not to... go through with it," he whispers. "He won't let this go, of course, and maybe there ain't a way to give his children life without killing him. But maybe this will keep him from doing it until long after I'm gone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mmm," Tarnish says. His eyes dart to yours, searching. He sighs heavily. 

"I know you're trying to do good," he says. "So I'll tell you what I know. Like he wants. But I wish you'd leave this alone."

He clasps your shoulder, speaking into your ear in a low whisper. "He's right that killing himself is the only way. His body ain't the problem. It's something in the way his makers made his mind an' spirit. Keeps reclaiming the energy he gives the children."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mmm," Tarnish says. His eyelids flutter. "Not sure. I've been tinkering with this one for fifty years, an' I still only half understand him!" 

He studies the air, rubbing his lips together. "You might try examining him on your own. Or you could try talking to the Order of Truth. They know more about old machines than I ever will!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a fine thing to want children," he says, blinking rapidly. "Wish I'd had 'em myself. Too late now, of course. No ladies knocking down my door!"  He cackles. 

"Of course, when people have children, it doesn't come at the cost of their lives, most of the time. An' that life doesn't belong to a creature that's older than oceans. It's a shame and a waste, but he wants what he wants. He always has. Doesn't mean I won't miss him." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Couldn't say," he says. His brow furrows. "Mmm. On my first day, I'd already met my wife. But she was still married to... whatsisname. With the fish-hook tattoo. An' I hadn't lost the finger an' grown it back yet, so..."

He peers at the ceiling, mouth working. "Seventy years? Give or take. I should retire, but there'd be no one left to mind him if I left." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I take care of my master," he says simply. "The Under-Foreman. There used to be more of us when he was making things, but when he... lost interest, the Master Foreman," he jerks a yellowed thumb at the construct at the center of the chamber, "hired 'em all. Offered 'em more."

Tarnish spits on the ground. "Happened a while back, but I don't forget a slight."</DefaultText>
