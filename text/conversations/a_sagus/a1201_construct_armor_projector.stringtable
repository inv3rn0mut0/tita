      <DefaultText>There is a shallow depression in the surface here, like many others scattered around the construct. Unlike the others, energy still pulses across this one at random intervals. A slight yet implacable sense of unease emanates with each wave of energy.

There is a loose lens at the center of the depression. You think you could redirect the psychic effects somewhere more useful, but it'll be tricky to get to it in between the energy pulses. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Random energy pulses continue inside the shallow depression. The lens provides warning before each pulse, but it could also be helpful in redirecting the protective energy to something more useful.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>On closer examination, the loose piece in the center is a kind of lens, and it glows briefly just before each pulse. With one eye on the lens, it should be easy to keep away from the energy field after all.

The lens seems to direct and focus the energy, though it has been knocked out of place. Perhaps the energy field's protection could be redirected somewhere more useful.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With careful timing, it is easy to twist the lens into what is hopefully a more favorable position. The lens glows, warning of an impending energy pulse. The field of energy extends outward and worms into eyes, ears, and mouths of Qorro's team. Hope drains from their faces, replaced by a numb stare. Then the shallow depression becomes dark and dormant.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With careful timing, it is easy to twist the lens to what is hopefully a more favorable position. The lens glows, warning of an impending energy pulse. The field of energy pulses outward this time, but the lens is not aiming at anything useful. The energy bursts into the air, sending a bubble of dust and leaves away, and then dissipates.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[With deft assurance, you slide the lens into the open then finesse it into place. One, two, three sparks arc before the light focuses through the lens and emerges like a bubble. The energy film covers your skin and you feel more resilient. Just as the bubble recedes into the lens, a second burst rushes out, further reinforcing the energy shield.]

      <DefaultText>[As you slip the lens out of the opening, it catches on the rim and a fine crack laces through the glass. You fit the optic into place and the sparks grow in speed until they coalesce into a bubble of energy that encases you. You feel more resilient, but then small cracks form a web in the energy and slice into your muscles. Though it does not hurt, you feel feeble, faint.]

      <DefaultText>Snatching the piece in between energy pulses, it becomes clear that the piece is attached somewhere beneath the depression. It's a lens of some kind. Without it, the pulses of energy have changed their shape.

The lens glows briefly before each pulse. Perhaps it could be used to refocus the protective energy somewhere more useful.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Taking care to avoid the sparking fibers, you reach your fingers into the opening and feel around until you land on a cold, smooth surface. With deft assurance, you slide the object out of the aperture. It is a small glass lens. Perhaps it could be fitted onto the hole?]

      <DefaultText>[You reach your fingers into the aperture and feel around. After a few seconds without anything of interest, you find purchase on a smooth, round surface. As you begin to pull it out, a spark from a nearby fiber leaps to your hand. You snap your hand out of the hole, bouncing the object off of the rim as it emerges. You hear a small pop. Once it's free, you see a glass lens the size of the hole - laced with a fine crack.]
