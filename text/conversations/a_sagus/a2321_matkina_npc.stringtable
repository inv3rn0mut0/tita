      <DefaultText>"You're joking, right? Did someone put you up to this?" She makes an elaborate show of looking around the room.

      <DefaultText>She strikes a pose and pretends to think. "Let's see... I'm a castoff, I'm 250 years old - give or take - I'm the most feared assassin in Sagus Cliffs, and I'm thinking of ways I could kill you permanently."

She drops her hands to her hips. "Why are you doing this? Is there any point?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is the Cave of Last Words. It was a thieves' hole until the tunnel leading in collapsed. Five, six hundred years ago, it was where the scum of the city would slip away from the city guard. Before there were levies, before the Slave Families, the truly desperate lawbreakers fled here when they had no other options."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's an old thieves' hole. Story is that Chila hid here before she became famous. It was old even then, a place where suicides and the desperate would come to launch their last big score... escaping life on their own terms."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That, there - that's the Suicide Tunnel." She points. "The words on the cave walls, those are the final words of people with nothing left to lose, etched into the bedrock of the city, burned in and burned out by the hopeless. A fitting metaphor."

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks at you appraisingly. "If you question the worth of your life, these terminal thoughts are... instructive. For a long time, they helped me hang on."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shudders. "The Children of the Endless Gate. A splinter sect of the Dendra O'Hur. Both of them gifts to the world from our beloved siblings. The Dendra are mostly harmless, disgusting as they are, worthless as their creator is. They have a chapel in the Underbelly. Go talk to them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Amateur. If you need my help, you need to bring me something to work with." She raises an eyebrow. "You *were* asking for my aid, yes? Not some half-cooked accusation?" She waves a hand at you. "Go on. I have... I have things I need to do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gives you a long, slow look. "You were in the Mere. You saw what happened. I wanted to make a difference, and they pissed on my hopes. After that debacle, I killed Tash and fell out with the rest of them." 

She frowns. "The conflict between the First and the Changing God swallows all our siblings, one way or another. I didn't want that. I wanted to make my own way. They weren't pleased. And... here I am. No worse for the lack of their company."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I listened to the stories of old thieves. I went to the Bloom and listened to the stories of Chila. I made friends with the sticha, and I asked them if they knew about a place like this. Turns out they did."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The wretched conclave? The sanctuary that's sapping castoffs' ingenuity? The false hope of our kind?" she snaps.

"Not what you were looking for, eh? It was built by the First and our sire for the purpose of finding a way to stop the Sorrow, shielded over, hidden from everyone. Then, when they split and started the Endless Battle, it became a haven where everyone agreed to put aside their enmity."</DefaultText>

      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She *was*, or she claimed to be. She's dead now. She said she'd fight for all of us. They say *she* was the one who founded Miel Avest for our sakes. Most of our siblings remember her as a hero." She spits in the corner. "Most of them never actually knew her."

"She was driven, I'll give her that. Even with her decaying body, with all its hurts and wounds, she found masks to cover herself and the strength not to hurt, and she kept plowing on."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the problem with two driven people - her and our creator - is that when their courses diverge, the results are... horrifying. We got the Endless Battle out of it, centuries of reality-splitting bloodshed. When you're fighting at that scale, individual lives... individual villages... don't mean that much."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She's dead now. Good riddance. She wasted centuries fighting our fraud of a father, and the Sorrow picked us off in the meantime. Thanks to both of 'em, we're no closer to safety than we were."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A few of us still cycle in and out of there. Castoffs who've decided they want to check out of humanity for a while. People who want to try their hand at figuring out why the Sorrow's killing us, and test their latest theories on how to stop it. The place is all protected, every emanation blocked. It's an attractive place to stay, but it's a temptation to *hide* there."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "Hundreds? Who knows. Supposedly the Changing God went to other worlds, bent time and space, slipped through dimensions... and he always had his spare bodies with him. There could be thousands, *millions* for all I know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some of us... our brother Riastrad, for instance... were better than the rest, and those better castoffs suffer. So listen up: every one of us spreads pain like a growing cancer. We all use each other for our own ends, and someone always gets broken at the end of it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives you a dark look. "Even us. Get that straight. You and me, we're both using each other right now. It'll profit us both, but someone's bound to get hurt." 

She shrugs. "Fair warning."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I figure that beneath it all, he's also a coward. Sure, life fights to continue to exist, but he took it a step farther, didn't he? And for what? To experience more? Maybe if he had some other reason he'd be more sympathetic, but from where I'm sitting, it looks like selfish fear."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't know if you meant to do that, but you've done more than your part of the deal. You asked about the resonance chamber. I know it. Mazzof's the guy you want. He can fix anything. He might have even helped design the chamber you're talking about. Your best bet is to look for him in the castoff sanctuary - Miel Avest."</DefaultText>
