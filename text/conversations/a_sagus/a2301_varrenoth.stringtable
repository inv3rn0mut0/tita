      <DefaultText>This large and heavily muscled woman wears what appear to be rags that should have fallen apart ages ago. She looks so tired that it wouldn't be a surprise if she fell asleep on her feet. And yet, when she opens her mouth, her voice is energetic, like a little girl who's about to get a present.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Really? You mean it? You want me to *fight* with you?" Varrenoth grins, her mouth going wider and wider until the construct's eyes are watering. 

"All right. I'll meet you there!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our IMPENETRABLE FORTRESS IN A LOST VALLEY is falling apart. I think we should just go out into the world for real, but no! My family is *afraid*." 

The fingers on the woman's right hand wiggle like they're playing an instrument. Her dead expression doesn't change even as the girl's voice rises. "I'm not, of course, but they won't even let me use this... this thing. I have to sneak around. Like a *child*!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Because we're looking for a new home. But ARAGOTH, LORD OF THE NORTH thinks we'll die if we go out without... oh. It did it again, didn't it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hello! Can anyone hear what I'm saying? Ah, I can't make this work!" Without warning, she slaps herself. 

"Um. I hope no one saw that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you talking to me?" Her head swivels awkwardly around, trying to catch a glimpse of you. "Oh! You are. My name is VARRENOTH, CHAMPION OF THE WASTES."

The woman flinches at the sound of the very different, booming voice that came from her own mouth.  "That's not my name you stupid thing! It's VARRENOTH, CHAMPION OF THE WASTES. Damn! I come from A LAND YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF. Dammit! I guess I'm not allowed to say." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That battle was *amazing*!" the girl says. "I'd try to hug you, but I'd probably break your back."

The body stretches its neck from side to side. "Fighting that thing taught me a few tricks. I really think I... " She trails off, trembling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm not, but you might as well call me that. Or just Varrenoth." One shoulder shrugs, and keeps shrugging. "I'm not actually here. I'm just talking through *her*. And trying to move her around."

Her shoulder freezes mid-shrug.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>

      <DefaultText>"BAH. DON'T BE RIDICULOUS," the other woman shouts. "You've got it," the girl says a second later.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It keeps yelling over me if I talk about something I'm not supposed to," she says, lowering her voice. "But maybe if I speak carefully..."

Her chin drops to her chest. "My... family explores the world. Using *special tools*." The body stabs itself with its finger pointedly. "But they tell me I'm too young to help. So I waited until everyone was sleeping, and... you know." The head lolls back on its neck, winking at the roof of the cavern.

"Are you an explorer too?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I am! I just don't know how it all works!" The woman clenches a massive fist, tendons standing against her skin like steel cables. 

"This isn't actually my body. I'm just talking through *her*. And trying to move her around." 

A foot lifts, freezes, and falls back to the ground. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh! Oh," she says. "For some reason, I thought that you were a CHAMPION OF THE WASTES too. Damn, it did it again, didn't it? Just don't tell anyone what I am, all right?"

      <DefaultText>"That is *such* a relief," she says. "It looks so simple, but it's really not."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>(Lie) "Yes, just like you. The body gets easier to control after a while."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, it's *really* hard to break. My mother - that's who usually controls it - once got stepped on by an adult earthshaker. It just stuck her in the ground like a nail."

The woman flexes a massive bicep. "Am I flexing?" the girl says. "I'm trying to flex. Anyway, it's also incredibly strong. 'Punch holes in mountains' strong." The arm flops back to her hip.

      <DefaultText>"I WAS BORN IN A STORM ON A BATTLEFIELD AT NIGHT," the woman roars.  

"Huh," the girl says after a respectful silence. "She *really* doesn't want me to tell you what I just tried to tell you."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And it's not *really* a construct. There's no metal inside. She has blood. Bones. Perfect human expressions. Not that you can tell that from how I do it," the girl adds sourly. The woman's face grimaces along with her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Seeds," the girl blurts. "Oh. She let me say it. But I probably won't get away with more. Sorry."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Who's there?" The muscular woman tilts her head to the side at an uncomfortable angle, peering at you through her slitted eyes as though she cannot figure out how to open them.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My mother's awake! I can't let her... I have to... Thank you so much for everything!"

And with that, Varrenoth, Champion of the Wastes, drops into a boneless heap at your feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Oddly, no thoughts at all come from this woman. At least you think she has none - there's a faint whispering at the edge of your hearing, but you can't make out any words.</DefaultText>
