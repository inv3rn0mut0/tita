      <DefaultText>As the levies march off and the crowd disperses, Ris steadies himself, not quite recovered from his ordeal. Finally he raises his head and focuses on you. "If you're the one who got me out of that nightmare, thank you, but where's that...?"

His eyes settle on Tybir. "There you are, you slippery bastard! Now, where's the money? If I went through that hell for nothing, I'll..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He steps back, spreading his hands. "Er, yes, about the money. You see, Ris, I was hoping to get a reward for turning in the fellow who sold us that brandy without telling us about its secrets, but-"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But?" Ris snarls. "There's always a 'but' when it comes to money, isn't there? I should have known! You only said you'd pay me so I wouldn't squeal on you, and you only saved my skin to save your own!"

He smacks his fists together. "Now, am I going to have to fight through your friend to get to you, or are you going to step out from behind him and take it like a man?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good," says Ris, and steps nose to nose with Tybir. "Now, Captain Silvertongue, why don't you tell me why you left me holding the bag when the levies started pounding on the door. Like a damned abykos, you were. Just vanished into thin air."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Dendra O'Hur," says Ris, "consume our memories with our flesh. They know everything by the time they've finished eating us, and Tybir knew I'd have plenty of memories of *him*, didn't you, you coward!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As far as it goes. He *would* have learned about me if he had eaten Ris, and I *did* manage to escape the levies when they showed up looking for us, but I didn't abandon you, lad!"

He puts his hand to his heart. "Ris, I escaped the levies and saved you from the Devourer of Wrongs because I love you and did not want to see you die. You have to believe me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glares at Tybir from under lowered brows. "That's as may be, but you certainly seemed to know when the levies were going to come calling."
