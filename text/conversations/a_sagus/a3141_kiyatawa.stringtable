      <DefaultText>On the surface, Kiyatawa looks exactly the same as when you first saw her in the Dendra O'Hur Chapel when you were investigating the murder of Fulsome's protege in the Underbelly. 

But some things have definitely changed. A feverish, blotchy glow colors her skin, and her grin is entirely at your expense. 

"Ah, it's the investigator," she says. "Good to see you again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She stares past you for a moment, the smile slipping from her face.

"I've been wondering," she says at last. "What would have happened if I told you the truth? If I'd confessed the moment we met?"

"The damage was done years ago. By the time I joined the Dendra O'Hur, I had killed three people who would were trying to kill me. I had a voice screaming in my head that my existence was *wrong*. The Endless Gate saved me. It gave me peace. Purpose."</DefaultText>
