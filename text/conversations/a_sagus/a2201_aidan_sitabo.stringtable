      <DefaultText>The large, muscled man is practicing some form of martial art as you look on. He is wearing an old, white, rough-woven coat with the sleeves torn off and a red bandana is wrapped tightly around his head. He seems to be moving much faster than his size suggests is possible.

He glides between stances as swiftly as water. His fists are blurring hammers, striking at invisible enemies. His bare, callused feet snap and slash at the air like knives.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The heavily-muscled man hasn't stopped punching and kicking the air yet. Maybe he never will. 

"You've returned," he says, his eyes locked on the invisible enemy before him. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes," Aidan says. "*The Drebil's Gift!*" His hand slips around an invisible assailant's arm. He snaps it with a stab of his elbow, then crushes his enemy's throat and flips him over his shoulder to the ground. 

"*Jesanthum Array!*" he shouts, spinning over the invisible adversary's corpse to deliver a triangle of jabs to the chest of his next attacker. 

The entire set of moves took no longer than four seconds. He catches you staring, and smiles. "You must be wondering why I'm shouting."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You raise your arms to shove his fists aside, and they dip below your guard, turning into twin spears that thrust up into your abdomen. Everything goes white. 

The next thing you're aware of is a harsh wheezing. It takes a few second to realize the sound is coming from you. Aidan hunkers over you, impassive.

"Return when you're ready," he says.

"It's suicide," he says at last, shaking his head. "Even if I slipped around its tentacles and hammered its flesh with my fists, it would rip me apart in seconds. I accept, of course. Pay me [Global: a2101_HiringAidanSitabo] shins, and my strength is yours."
