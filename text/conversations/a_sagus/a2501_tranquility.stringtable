      <DefaultText>A woman as tall and graceful as a willow steps forward to greet you. She bows, then looks down at you with warm, gold-flecked eyes. 

"Welcome," she says, "to Tranquility's Rest. I am the proprietress, Tranquility. Are you looking for a place to take your ease?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs melodiously. "No need for apologies. Given my height, it is a natural question. I am indeed human - a human mutant, and fortunate to live in Sagus Cliffs where that is not a crime. There are very few places in this world where someone like me would even be allowed to clean a hostel, let alone own one."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>She smiles faintly. "If calming can be said to be manipulating, I suppose I am, but it is nothing more than that. I cannot control minds or influence thoughts. My scent seems to relax people. That - and another trick I learned - convinced me that opening a hostel might lead to success."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>She raises her eyebrows. "Very few people notice that. Well done. I am indeed manipulating my voice. When I opened this place, I wanted to make it the most relaxing hostel in the Ninth World, and I worked to make every aspect of it soothing, even my voice." She smiles mysteriously. "Another talent of mine has been helpful as well." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks bemused. "No one has ever asked me something like this before, and normally I would refuse for fear of some... complication, and perhaps retaliation for that. But I sense a certain affinity between us, a kindness we share. I don't think any harm will come of it. If you feel it will help you, I will do it."

She reaches out to you. "Now take my hands and close your eyes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks bemused. "No one has ever asked me something like this before, I..." She shakes her head. "As interesting a proposition as it is, I must refuse, for fear of some complication - or retaliation for the same."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She hesitates, then nods. "Very well, as long as you are willing to absolve me from blame, I will do it." She reaches out to you. "Now take my hands and close your eyes."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "I'm afraid it's not possible. This is a place of safety and peace, and I can guarantee neither of those things if we try this."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs. "Very well. Your curiosity has spurred my own. In the name of new experience, we will do this together."

She reaches out to you. "Now take my hands and close your eyes."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>A momentary flash of anger breaks through her calm but vanishes again instantly, and she looks at you gravely. "I have spent too long building the reputation of safety and peace this hostel enjoys. I will not risk it for a stranger's whim. Let's change the subject."

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives you a sad smile. "Perhaps? Many people stay here, and this woman might have been among them, but I don't remember her. I'm sorry."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "I'm afraid not. We have many visitors here. It could have been any of them."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I found a comb in one of your rooms, and I showed it to Omahdon. He's sure it belonged to Perseia. She's been here, hasn't she?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Omahdon may believe her to be his one true love, but it is obsession, not love, and it has made a monster of him." 

She sighs. "From what Perseia told me, he found her corpse in a sepulchre in the Valley of Dead Heroes, perfectly preserved by ancient science, and fell in love with her beauty. His foolishness might have ended there, except that Omahdon had ancient science of his own, and he used it to wake her from death."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perseia owes Omahdon her life. Whatever else he's done, that should count for something."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You truly believe that?" She looks at you again, eyebrow raised. "After hearing how Omahdon has hounded her? You worry me."

She looks you up and down. "What do you intend to do?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I believe that his love for her is true. He would never hurt Perseia. He wants the best for her."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Unasked or not, he still gave her life. Surely he deserves another chance to prove himself in return for that miracle."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks at the floor, weighing your words. "Very well. I believe that you sincerely want to help, so if you vouch for Omahdon, I will take him at his word. I hope I do not come to regret telling you where she is." 

She raises her eyes to yours. "She went back to the Valley of Dead Heroes. He will find her there."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>She frowns, then shakes her head. "Perhaps he has the science to help her, but I don't believe he has the will. He's only using this as another excuse to talk to her. I will not tell you where she's gone."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods. "It is his wrong to fix. And if she finds she loves him for offering to help her, so be it. Very well, Perseia went back to the Valley of Lost Heroes. He will find her there."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "It's a trick. He makes this offer solely to get close enough to abduct her. I will not allow it. You will never get Perseia's location from me."

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>She thinks about it for a long moment, then sighs. "I have deeply mixed feelings about this, but life is undeniably a gift. I suppose she owes him another chance to prove his love. Very well, Perseia went back to the Valley of Dead Heroes. He will find her there."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And suppose she didn't want a new life? This is not her world nor her time. Why should she be happy here?"

She shakes her head. "No. He deserves nothing. I will not tell you where she is."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>She weighs the idea, then shrugs. "As long as it's only that and not another attempt at abduction, I suppose it can't do her any harm to let him prove his love. Very well, Perseia went back to the Valley of Lost Heroes. He will find her there."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And suppose she didn't want a new life? All he has done is given her the nightmarish choice of living in a world and time not her own or ending her life by her own hand."

She shakes her head. "No. He deserves to be punished for this, not rewarded. I will not tell you where she is. Ever."
