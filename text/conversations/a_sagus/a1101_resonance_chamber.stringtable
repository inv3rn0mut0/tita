      <DefaultText>Sunlight falls through the ragged hole in the roof onto the shattered resonance chamber. It is hard to believe that *you* did this, that you plummeted through the curve of the pale-blue sky, crashed through the dome, and broke this delicate machine with your own body.

It is hard to believe that you are still alive.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Four mechanical arms hang over the center of the device, above the cracked, semi-transparent crystal of the sarcophagus. The fifth arm lies broken on the floor among the scattered synth and crystal shards, and a metal ring surrounds the array, dented and broken by your impact crater.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel the slightest hint of resistance every time you cross the ring, and now that you're paying attention, you note that your breath is echoing in your ears, as though you were inside a glass dome. When you step outside the ring, the feeling passes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You kneel to inspect a broken section and take note of the field projectors inside. They are omnidirectional. 

The ring exists to protect anyone standing inside it but also to contain tremendous amounts of power. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cables run from machines along the dome's walls to the base of the suspended arms, each of which is capped with long needles, aimed at the cracked, coffin-like chamber at the center of the platform.

Gem-like lights flicker dimly at the bases of the arms. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The needle-like extensions at the ends of the arm glitter in the dome's faint light. A number of the lights at the bases of the arms have gone out.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A memory steals over you - and it isn't yours. 

Sunlight falls through the unbroken dome, casting short, angular shadows behind the servitors laboring to construct the device you and your assistant have designed. Their efficiency is perfect - after all, you designed *them* as well.

The components are nearly in place. A ring for bounding. A platform for focusing, and-

"Five injectors. One for each Tide." It is a moment before you realize the memory has faded and you've spoken aloud.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Jagged fragments of crystal are intermingled with synth from the shattered dome above. The crystal shards glitter in the light like captive suns.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A faint scratching sound draws your attention to two crystalline chunks near your feet. As you watch, they tumble gently into each other and meld, their disparate angles flowing together like water.

After a moment, they part again, trailing shining threads of living crystal. It seems that the resonance chamber *can* heal from certain wounds, but not from the amount of damage you've done to it. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A flicker of movement at your feet pulls your eyes down. As you watch, two crystalline chunks tumble gently into each other and meld, their disparate angles flowing together like glass.

      <DefaultText>You move into the hanging clouds of sparkling powder, carefully stepping around the sharp fragments of synth to the shards of crystal from the resonance chamber. Some are no larger than splinters, while others are larger than your head. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The padded interior beneath the coffin's cracked lid looks like it was made for a human body. Despite the damage, you don't see any way to open it and get inside. 

You glance between the sarcophagus and the needle-like protrusions at the ends of the arms above. It seems likely that using this chamber would not be a pleasant experience. </DefaultText>
