      <DefaultText>A staggering array of mirrors and lenses encircle you. Cables run from their backs to various machines scattered throughout the room. 

Behind the display, you hear a hinge creak.

      <DefaultText>The mirrors twitch as you gaze from surface to surface. Eventually, you realize why. They are attuned to your mind - you can move each one as effortlessly as your own hand. 

Every surface shows something *else* besides your reflection. A sliver of glass highlights a red cord around your throat. A small oval mirror lingers on a pulsing blue star beneath your forehead. The mirrors to either side of the large, central mirror periodically flash purple.

The tiny lenses above it all crane their necks to study *you*.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You sense that the tiny lenses are moving with purpose and hold still. They carefully swivel to focus on your arms, and you see something... odd.

The *you* in the audience of lenses is bigger. Stronger. You feel a painful twinge in the crook of your arm and one of the lenses goes cloudy gray.</DefaultText>

No... not sense. Remember. You *remember* that these mirrors are directed not just at this world, but at others as well. You can see things in these mirrors that aren't visible to the naked eye. 

And if you aren't careful, they'll see you too.
