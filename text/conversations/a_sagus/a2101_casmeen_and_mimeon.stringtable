      <DefaultText>[Casmeen and Mimeon greet you and ask all about what happened to you. After explaining it to them, they tell you that a castoff built the resonance chamber, so maybe another castoff could help you. There are two in Sagus Cliffs - Matkina and Riastrad.]</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>He nods, satisfied. "As I thought. You are a castoff, one of his children." He touches you with his long-fingered hand as if in consolation. "There is no shame in such a thing. Many castoffs have come to our attention, and some of them have sought to deceive us so that they might seem more important." He smiles softly. "If you are as new as we suspect, it is better for you - for *us* - to know the truth of your existence than to bluster and lie."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gestures toward the Clock behind him. "Dark figures circumambulate these clock faces. I theorize that your creation of the time-shields that protected this city established a connection with your future selves. Or perhaps your wisdom brought them here. Whatever the truth, we believe those figures may be castoffs - or ghosts of castoffs, perhaps - the living shells of the bodies you have worn previously."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gestures toward the Clock behind him. "Dark figures circumambulate these clock faces.
