      <DefaultText>At first glance, it would be easy to assume that this man is dying of some wasting disease... or starvation. He is little more than a too-tall skeleton wrapped in translucent flesh and a tattered robe. His hands are essentially bony claws.

      <DefaultText>"At any rate, we scour the streets for bodies, er, left *unclaimed*. We bring them here and lay them upon the biers." His sweeping hand directs your attention to the still, shrouded figures lying about the chamber.

"When a body is *ripe* with unplucked secrets, we gather about it and taste it together. Let a lifetime of thoughts flit around ours like little fish." 

He smacks his lips happily.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Imbitu and his followers lean over you in well-orchestrated unison, cutting slits in your flesh. Hoses dangle from their wrists, leading into their suits. They snake, seemingly of their own accord, into your incisions. 

For a moment, nothing happens. Then, you hear a faint whirring as spinning blades grind your organs, and suck the pulp up through the hoses. 

Someone is screaming, and you have a fairly good idea who. Eventually, mercifully, you die.

      <DefaultText>After an indefinite amount of time, you open your eyes. Imbitu stands beside you, fiddling with his knuckles. 

"Ah!" he says, raising his hands. "Welcome back! What an *exquisite* experience that was... though I'm certain you don't need to hear about it while you're waking up!"

He beams. "At any rate! I took the liberty of adding a token of our gratitude to your belongings. Do come speak to me whenever you're ready to discuss what we learned from our little feast."

{GAVIN and GEORGE: Add the following information later in the project, given time: The Dendra might also refer to some of the experiences the player has had so far in the game (since they will have acquired some of the player's memories) and could make suggestions about (for example) things the player missed. . Additionally, Imbitu invites the player to learn the mysteries of the cult - if the player is interested, he should speak to Imbitu in private. }</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He chortles, apparently unoffended. 

"If that were true, we'd be quite guilty of horrendous inefficiency. There'd be no need for all these hoses and tubes. We'd simply be able to, er, 'tuck in'."

His smile fades slightly. "But no. Our process is quite real. Very powerful. And you'd do well to understand how something works before you declare it doesn't." </DefaultText>
