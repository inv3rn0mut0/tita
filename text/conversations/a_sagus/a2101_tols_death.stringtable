      <DefaultText>You stand over Tol's body, and you can already see her flesh knitting itself back together. She's a castoff just like you, and she's going to come back to life. That is, unless you do something about it.

You could send her a message, maybe, scar her flesh... but unless you destroy her body utterly, she's going to revive.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Earlier, I spoke to you of how to destroy a castoff body utterly. Do you remember?" She looks at Tol's body and nudges it with a toe.

      <DefaultText>"You want to do some damage to a castoff, you need to make it permanent. Wounds alone won't do it. Neither will crushing. If we want to get rid of Tol, we'll need to cut her to pieces. If we want to be safe, we should burn the pieces in a fire. Sadly, I can't see any wood we can use."</DefaultText>
