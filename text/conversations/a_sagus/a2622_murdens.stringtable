      <DefaultText>A cluster of hunched creatures awaits you this dark room smelling of rust and blood. They are birdlike abhumans with chipped beaks, matted feathers, and filthy, leather robes. It's not their appearance that reminds you who they are. It's the gritty static that fills your head - a side effect of the creatures' telepathy. 

These are murdens - cruel and cunning scavengers. And a fifth of their number lies dead on the ground, with great chunks torn out its body. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The largest murden straightens, eyeing you, snapping its beak once, twice. It seems to be waiting for you to speak. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sure. They have lots of names. 'Raven-men', for one. Cal..." he grimaces at the recollection, but forges on regardless. "Callistege called them 'dulsein' for some reason."

He lowers his voice. "Point is, don't give them an excuse to attack. That includes threatening them... or not threatening them enough."

      <DefaultText>The murdens toss their feathered heads at your words and seem to swell beneath their robes. Still, none of them will quite meet your eyes.

      <DefaultText>The static washes against the sealed bulwark of your buried past... and an unrelated memory wakes, tinged with throbbing cords of disgust. 

"In this vial," you say to the mewling traitor bound to the wall, "is living flame. I don't use the word lightly. It has feelings. Morals. Self-respect. It will *regret* what it does to you. It will *grieve*, and neither of you will ever be the same."

      <DefaultText>"It's a corruption of a much longer term from an obscure tongue," she says, idly studying the murdens. "It means 'sickening birds,' I'm told."

She lowers her voice. "They will be looking for weaknesses in us, depend on it. If you wish to avoid a fight, we must show our strength - but not back them into a corner."

"It was in a bathhouse," he continues in a low, urgent whisper. "I fell asleep in the water, dreaming of... uh, doesn't matter. But when I woke up, my clothes were gone. The house-keeper told me that murdens had stolen them, and charged me a hundred shins for a spare pair of pants!"</DefaultText>

"Possibly," he admits at last. "You're a sharp one."
