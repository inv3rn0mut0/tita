      <DefaultText>If the player *has* learned about Mazzof and Miel Avest, then Matkina will just ask for the player's help. Satsada, if present, *will* warn the player about the dangers of Merecasters, much to Matkina's irritation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes flick to your tattoo again, then back to her workbench. Suddenly the device is in her hand, though you didn't see her pick it up.

"You're one of us, then. Disembowelling would just be a waste of time for you... and a mess for me." 

She spits on the floor and scuffs it with her boot, all nervous energy. "So what do you want from me?"</DefaultText>

A crooked grin plays about the corner of her mouth, and then vanishes. "I know who can help you. Or did." She shakes her head. "It slips away. My mind has holes in it. One of our brothers took a rusty scalpel to my thoughts, my memories. I can't..."

She trails off. She catches a hold of the table, and it seems to anchor her. Her eyes harden.</DefaultText>

Then she grabs your shirt. "You need to help me. I can't tell you anything until you help me heal my thoughts. One of our brothers - he put holes in my memory. I need to find out what he did so I can stop the drain, but I can't use the Merecaster myself."</DefaultText>
