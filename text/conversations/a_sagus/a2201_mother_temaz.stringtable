      <DefaultText>"Mayhap you did," she says at last. "You tried, anyway. But he didn't find the girl as you left her, sad to say. It's not my place to meddle, but should you check on him in the Underbelly, I'd be grateful." She roots about in a saddlebag hanging at her hip. 

"Take the caul, lad. You earned it."

      <DefaultText>"That boy makes a woman believe in gods with a soft spot for fools," she says, snorting. "His mother survived a difficult birth only to die from a scratch a few years later. His aunt raised him, if you can call it that."

She shakes her head. "The boy spent years working toward an early death alongside the scum of the city. Now he's a citizen and living the straight and up." She spits. "Better than him are dead and forgotten."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This woman glares at the air above her head, her fingers fretting with a single bead in a long, peculiar chain of them. She is grumbling to herself, a constant stream of irritated, unformed words.

"There you are, girl," she says, winding the beads around her wrist with a few violent twists and rotting about in the bags hanging at her hips. "I was wondering when you'd find yer way to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, girl," she says, favoring you with a thin smile. Her hands steal to a metallic, many-faceted bead near the end of the chain. "Wanderer that you are. Breaking things before you know they do. A lucky one, you are, and all for the good."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, Mother Temaz *knows* you, girl. Born falling, you were. Born in flame, shreds of yer smoldering caul streaming through the air. When you struck ground, yer bead first went cold, then hotter than a mother's hatred."

She chuckles wetly. "Scarcely born you are, and already yer solving my children's problems unasked. Thank you for saving me the effort."</DefaultText>

      <ID>258</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aye. You fell from the blue womb of the sky, and yer speed set the caul around you alight, scattering flaming bits across the city. I snatched one for myself. Still have it, in fact, *somewhere*." She shakes her head, still digging through her bags. "I intended to give it to you as a reward for helping Loss-of-self, but then you solved her troubles all on yer own."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She finds what she's looking for in the saddlebag along her hip, and hands it over. 

"There, take the caul. Improved through my art, and stronger than when you lost it."

She gives you another brief smile and turns away. It seems she's done with you. </DefaultText>

She chuckles again, shaking her head.</DefaultText>
