He booms at you as you approach. "Ah! Another likely fellow. Excellent! The people have called for deliverance from this ravaging stichus, and a hero has answered. Most courageous of you!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He frowns as he gets a better look at you. "Wait. I know you. You're the one who made peace with the sticha. Commendable, but I'm afraid one of your new friends didn't hear about the end of hostilities. It's running rogue here in Cliff's Edge."

He looks uneasily at the crowd. "If these people get hold of it, things might go badly, and all your work will have been for nothing. Best if you were to find it first, then return and tell me precisely where it is. I'll take it from there."</DefaultText>
