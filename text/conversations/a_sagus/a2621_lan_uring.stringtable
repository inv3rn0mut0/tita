      <DefaultText>The thin young man smiles hesitantly as you approach. You notice a small metallic ovoid protruding from his skull, nearly hidden by his disheveled hair. The fingers of his left hand tap nervously on his leg as he speaks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He rubs the ovoid implant on his forehead with his thumb, thinking. It takes him a few moment to realize you are there.

      <DefaultText>"I'm not a real priest yet," he blurts, then blushes. "If that's what you were thinking. Usually, visitors only talk to me because they think I'm a priest, but I-I'm still a novice. Um."

He plucks at a threadbare spot on his robes. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's not just on my forehead," he says. "Not just the skin, I mean. It's bonded with my skull."

He blinks at you a few times before he realizes he hasn't answered your question. "It keeps me awake and alert. I don't get tired until it runs out of power."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm designing an intelligence," he says. "But not the normal kind. Not, um, just metal, or with a dependent intelligence rigging system. No. It's larger than that. Stronger."

Lan himself seems to be getting stronger, rising as he speaks. You hadn't noticed before, but he is actually taller than you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The idea is this - an intelligence that can find, test, identify, and fully understand numenera. We can unlock the secrets of lost civilizations!" 

His eyes are gleaming now, and he raises a trembling fist. "Do you understand? If we do this, we can break the chains binding us to the past, and turn them into reins with which to steer the future!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have a plan," he says defensively, dropping his righteous fist. "But it will take more time. And money. Um."

He sweeps the room with a terrified look and continues in a whisper. "I needed money for my work. The Order doesn't pay for anything besides basic living expenses. One of the Memovira's people came to me and me money for a 'favor'. I took it. Of course I did!"</DefaultText>

"It's perfect! I've read about the phenomenon. All of us have. None of us guessed that probability engines were tampering with the women before they were born!"

      <DefaultText>Lan eventually returns, wearing robes so clean and new that the fold-lines are still visible. He looks like he's going to faint. 

"I'm a priest," he croaks. "Thank you. Thank you *so* much." 

He paws at his desk blindly, stunned by the shifts in his fortune. Eventually, he retrieves what he was looking for - one of his machine intelligence prototypes. 

"Take it," he says, handing it to you.
