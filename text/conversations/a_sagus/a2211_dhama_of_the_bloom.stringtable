      <DefaultText>The wispy mustache on this pudgy, middle-aged man would be almost comical if it weren't for his deep and despairing eyes. They are the eyes of a man who has passed through the gates of alien hells and returned... though not necessarily whole.

His fingers, tightly wrapped around some fine glassware, are strong and slim - a musician's fingers, or a strangler's.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>According to Dhama, a malign group of beings emerged from the Bloom a few years ago, having passed through a Maw from some other world or dimension. They were beings of pure thought, and the psychics knew them only as the Adversaries. As soon as they arrived in Sagus Cliffs, they began to wreak havoc upon the minds of its citizens, inciting conflict, inflicting madness, and ruining lives.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>o	Theboros could chime in about fighting in a thankless war for which the veterans will never be recognized. (I'm guessing that Theboros will think this was foolish because no one will remember, while Dhama will think they did the right thing - a legacy discussion. But up to you Colin.) The player can chime in and contribute to the philosophical discussion for Tidal points and DP. </DefaultText>

Dhama should warn the player about the haunted booth on the other side of the bar. People often hear voices and feel a presence there - even he doesn't know what it is. If the player encountered the ghostly woman already, he could optionally mention this to Dhama (up to the writer).</DefaultText>

At last the eye retracts and her forehead closes. She swallows, and you can feel the fear radiate from her. "He's right. It's there, on a low pulse, a wavelength far below human thought."</DefaultText>

"You have done something I never would have dreamed possible. Never. You saw something that needed to be done, and... you did it."

He reaches under the table and pulls out a strange-looking device. "Here," he says. "Take this. You've earned it, and more."

He shrugs helplessly. "Sadly, our fifth eye is blind." He jerks a thumb at the bartender. "It might be that our foe has blinded us... but it might not have shielded itself from *you*. Look for it, and tell me if you find something unusual."</DefaultText>

"But I'm not usual. No one in the Fifth Eye is. We're psychics, psionics, seers. Call us mind-benders or thought-rippers. But we're warriors. We keep the minds of Sagus Cliffs safe from threats they don't even imagine."</DefaultText>

You see a void, oblivion, a place where black stars hang and shriek with formless rage.

He looks at Theboros and Ziobe. They exchange a wordless communication, and he shrugs. "We used a spotter - someone trained to recognize their scent. He'd give them the briefest engagement, enough to whet their appetites, and he'd bring them to a battlefield of our choosing." </DefaultText>

"Look. We used a spotter - someone trained to recognize their scent.
