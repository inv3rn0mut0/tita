      <DefaultText>A dark sphere inhabits almost every socket in this obelisk that stretches toward the cavernous ceiling. No one else seems to be paying the odd structure any attention. Like most numenera, it's simply *here*, and if it can't be used, it's treated as part of the scenery. 

The orbs gleam in the dim light. You lean toward them. Are they glass? Jewels? Eyes?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A flicker from one of the orbs above you catches your eye. You look up just in time to see the image of a woman leaning toward the surface of the glass from the inside. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your finger barely grazes the glass before it displays the image of a furred creature touching the surface from the other side. Purple vines threaded with veins of light hang from the branches of the trees behind it. You lift your fingertip and darkness swallows the creature. The orb is opaque once more.

The orbs appear to reflect whatever action is performed in front of them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You make the most obscene gesture you can think of at the glass. A young woman with rainbow pupils appears in the glass, flicking her fingertip across her chin. 

She nods, grinning, as if imagining your shock at her daring. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nothing appears in any of the dark orbs. Instead, the whisper of many voices joined in song curls from the obelisk, so low that only you can hear it.

      <DefaultText>With your lips nearly brushing the surface, you whisper a thought you've never told anyone. A too-tall, narrow-hipped being - a visitant - appears in the glass, long fingers clasped. 

Meeting your eyes, it speaks words you cannot hear. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You can, however, read lips. The language isn't one you recognize, but the wordless thoughts behind the words tickles an odd part of your mind.

Dizziness overcomes you. You suddenly *know* that these are stolen words and that blood was spilled to take them. Even though the cause was just, the visitant is deeply ashamed. 

It fades into the black of the orb, lowering its head. </DefaultText>
