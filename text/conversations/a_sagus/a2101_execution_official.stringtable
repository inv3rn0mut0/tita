      <DefaultText>He sighs. "Another rustic. It is very simple, sir. Our nanos induce in him a hallucinogenic state. In this state he experiences visions... nightmares, really. He speaks of the things he sees, and his words become flesh as they leave his mouth. We shape the flesh into a humanlike form - the Death you see beside him." He gestures toward the hideous figure, which looks to be made of rotting viscera. 

"As more strands escape his mouth, his Death wraps them around him, and they slowly crush the life out of him." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "Some believe there is wisdom to be gained from the rantings of the condemned. I have never gleaned any.
