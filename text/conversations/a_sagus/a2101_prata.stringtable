      <DefaultText>In the shadows cast by the folds of this merchant's cowl, you glimpse hints of verdant chitin and amber mandibles erupting from pale human flesh. Her voluminous robes cannot hide the fact that her movements are... off, as if too many joints inhabit too little space. 

But her voice - her voice is a warm, tumbling flood of spoken thoughts and impulses.â€‹</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A fair afternoon to you! Well, I say 'afternoon', but night has come early. I wonder what..." 

Her brilliant, multi-faceted eyes flicker over you. Something begins humming in one of her many pockets. "Another one with that tattoo. Adhesive residue on the fingertips. No surprise at the sudden night." Her mandibles click open, revealing a delighted smile. "*You're* responsible for our unexpected nightfall. Tell me how you did it!"

      <DefaultText>"A fair afternoon to you. Warm, isn't it?"

Something begins humming in one of her many pockets, and her brilliant, multi-faceted eyes flicker toward an invisible point in the distance. "Well, not as warm as it could be. But this is the warmest minute of the week by a considerable margin." 

She trails off, but the hum continues. "Oh, you have one of those tattoos too. Anyway! Can I interest you in some prime artifacts? Dusty relics? Numenera of uncertain origin?"</DefaultText>

She hesitates. "Of course, they were probably worried I was going to snip their heads off. But the Underbelly is *fascinating*, and worth the risk! Most everywhere is."</DefaultText>

She winks. "I'll give you a discount on everything I carry, from now until the last star in the sky collapses. Or, you know, one of us dies. Can't do a thing about that!" She laughs again, clearly unworried by the prospect. </DefaultText>

She trails off, waving a claw at you. "No! Don't tell me. Answers take all the mystery out of life. Anyway! Can I interest you in some prime artifacts? Dusty relics? Numenera of uncertain origin?"
