      <DefaultText>This man is large and broad-shouldered, and his steel armor is painted in the silver and indigo colors of Sagus Cliffs. He seems to be an ordinary soldier or constable of the city... too ordinary, perhaps. As you scan his face, you see that his features are plain, forgettable, almost generic.

Not only that... his eyes are a little too large, his smile too firmly fixed upon his face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This armored levy is almost a mirror image of his comrade who stands on the other side of the execution platform. You sense that something about them is subtly different, but at first glance, you can't quite determine what it is.

He nods and greets you in a remarkably similar voice. "Hello, Visitor."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soldier peers at you, smile never leaving his face. "You must be a stranger to this city... perhaps from one of the autochthonous tribes along the frontier?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Regrettably, I cannot." The soldier's smile doesn't leave his face. "By order of the Slave Families, I must prevent anyone from approaching the condemned man." 

He gestures toward the wretched figure on the dais, who appears to be speaking nonsense as his body is slowly wrapped in rotting entrails. "You must be new to this city, to ask such a thing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soldier blinks in confusion, but the smile never leaves his face. "Perhaps. You are not a citizen, but still you seem familiar. It is a strange circumstance, as I was raised only fourteen days ago."

He pauses as if trying to remember what he is supposed to say next.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Every citizen is required to raise a levy for the protection of the city. In times of war or strife, citizens are sometimes called upon to raise additional levies, but this has not been required since a dread destroyer crossed the northern frontier, thirty-four years ago."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes. A year of life is taken from a citizen. The lost year is used to create a levy." He pauses ever so briefly, though his smile remains fixed in place. "That is why our lifespans are precisely one year long. When our spans are up, we degrade into our component matter."

"If you are curious about the process, I have been instructed to direct you to the Order of Truth, where you may observe the machine that is our... parent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A year is removed from a citizen's lifespan and used to create one of us. Anyone who wishes to become a citizen of Sagus Cliffs must make this sacrifice."

He regards you calmly, smiling as always. "Our own lifespans are only a single year - then we degrade into our component matter. If you wish to know more, you may inquire at the Order of Truth." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Indeed so. Each Slave Family sends one representative - usually the head of the Family - to sit on the Council. We are required to follow their commands."</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>If you saw the face of this man on the streets of a city, you wouldn't glance at him twice - his features are utterly ordinary and forgettable, not too ugly, not too handsome. It is, indeed, almost like he is an *average* of many thousands of men, their idiosyncrasies and imperfections merged into a bland middle ground.

The exceptions, of course, are the eyes, which are just a bit too large for the face, and the fixed, ever-present smile. Taken together, the man's features give you a vague sense of unease.</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>The face of this levy is nearly identical to his comrade on the other side of the execution platform. If they're different, the variations are extremely subtle and random - a slight difference in the shape of the ears, perhaps, or a barely-discernible quirk of the lips when he smiles... as he does, constantly. Otherwise, the two men could be twins.

Actually, they are even less distinguishable than twins.</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>One other detail catches your attention. Almost hidden by the levy's armor is a tiny fetish or charm... a roughly-fashioned representation of an archway or a window, made from bits of metal, wood, and glass.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>For the briefest moment, the levy's smile nearly falters. "That... that is my year... the year that was taken from a citizen to create me. It reminds me of the front window through which he saw... would have seen... the pretty girl who sells the false birds. It is... would have been... a good year."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm afraid that is not permitted during an execution." The levy's smile never falters. "If you wish, you may appeal to the official in charge." 

He points to the stocky man who stands at the projecting edge of the execution platform, dressed in indigo finery.</DefaultText>
