      <DefaultText>This couple stands together, their shared gaze fixed away from you. No words pass between them - instead, they share a silent language of tenderness. Their bodies turn subtly towards each other, forming a private space between them. His hand reaches for hers, and without looking, she claims it. 

Still looking past you, they smile together. His is a curving line carved in oak, hers as unabashed and radiant as a lantern on a starless night. </DefaultText>
