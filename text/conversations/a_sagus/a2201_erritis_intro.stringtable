      <DefaultText>The first thing you notice about this wiry young man is the golden haze - the *glow* - surrounding him. It sparkles in his eyes and gives his easy grin a warmth that you can *feel* right down to your gut.

      <DefaultText>"I'm glad you asked!" This is somewhat of an understatement. He looks *ecstatic*. 

"I was climbing up the cliffs to Caravanserai to see how impossible it was when I saw a star falling toward the Reef." He raises an earnest finger. "I knew, right then, that finding that star was my destiny."

He runs his hands through his curls. "But what was I going to do? Climb down? Boring. Already did it the other way. Walk? *Walk*? Worse. Far worse. No fun at all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gives you a puzzled look, as if you've just wondered aloud why air is important. 

"I'm an adventurer," he repeats, brow furrowed. "I thought I told you. Adventure happens when I'm around, and you'll get to be a part of it."

He raises a finger. "But you'll have to keep up, where we go..." He stares at the invisible horizon. "...we go swiftly. Strongly. And most of all, handsomely." He leans in conspiratorially. "Until you get handsome, I'll cover for the both of us." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's strange," he says, sweeping a lock of blond hair out of his eyes. "I already talked to him once. I was explaining to him how I needed to borrow an airship. He said no, so I waited until he wasn't looking and borrowed it anyway..." He trails off, his golden glow diminishing slightly. A troubling thought wrestles its way onto his face.

He blinks, and a wide smile spreads over his face. His aura *flares* like a star. "Yes! It *is* the right thing to do! And I'm going to do it! I'm going to right this wrong!"

      <DefaultText>"Say I'm sorry? Whatever for? Sorries are for those that *are* sorry, and unfortunate those lot are, always sad-eyed and head-hunched. Be proud of your sorries, I say!" He takes a quick breath. "If *anyone* should be handing out sorries, it's that lazy airship! Think what could have happened in less disciplined hands!"

A muffled *boom* sounds from within the crumpled airship nearby.

      <DefaultText>"No!" he says cheerfully. "You said it yourself. He's pretty angry at me, and I'm not good at making people not-mad. Nothing short of chains could drag me back up there."

He pauses, frowning. "Of course, I might end up there by accident. I don't have a great sense of direction. Sometimes, I just follow people around for hours, hoping they know where they're going more than me!"</DefaultText>

His face falls. "I don't know what happened next. Despite my expert piloting, the airship steered itself directly at the cliffs. I had no choice. I landed it as fast and hard and safely as possible." Shaking his head, he sighs. 

"I never did find that falling star. At this point, someone else has found it, and it's *their* destiny now."</DefaultText>
