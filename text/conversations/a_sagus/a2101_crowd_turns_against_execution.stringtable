      <DefaultText>The four people you talked into helping Ris start chanting, "Free the prisoner! Free the prisoner! Let him go! Let him go!"

Spurred on by their passion - or maybe just bored - the rest of the crowd begins to pick up the chant. "Let him go! Let him go!"

They advance menacingly on the levies and the overseer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Unnaturally goaded by the Tides, the whole crowd immediately begins to chant, "Free the prisoner! Free the prisoner! Let him go! Let him go!"

      <DefaultText>The levies edge back, their normally pleasant expressions turning into uncertain frowns. The overseer points directly at you. 

"I saw what you did, you rabble rouser! This is your doing! Well, I'm not risking my life to intervene in the fate of a worthless piece of belly trash. If you want him, take him!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The overseer signals the levies. "Unmake the prisoner's Death and retreat! He isn't worth our blood!"

At his order, one of the levies takes out a device like a circular mirror and squeezes its frame. The mirror spins, flashing shards of light across the Death and the umbilical viscera it is wrapping around Ris, and all of it disintegrates. Soon Ris stands alone on the platform as reddish dust swirls away from him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There!" cries the overseer. "Satisfied?"

With that, he and the Levies turn and march away as the crowd surrounds the platform and cheers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The levies edge back, their normally pleasant expressions turning into uncertain frowns. 

The overseer holds up nervous hands to the crowd. "Stop! Stand back! What's come over you?"</DefaultText>
