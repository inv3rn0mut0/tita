      <DefaultText>You immediately recognize this bespectacled man from Caravanserai in Sagus Cliffs. His name was... Omahdon.

      <DefaultText>And that means that the purple-haired woman is Perseia - the woman you helped him find. He turns to you, fury in her eyes.

"You. Hello. Would you please tell him to leave me alone?" she says through her teeth. "He won't listen to me!"

      <DefaultText>"My friend, you misunderstand," Omahdon says. "This is precisely the condition I described to you before - she looks upon me, the love of her life - and sees an enemy." He tries to lay a calming hand against her cheek and she swats it away. His expression hardens. 

"Thank you for reuniting us, my friend," he says, and there is naked malice in his smile now.

      <DefaultText>Perseia turns a withering look on you. 

"Oh, thank you *so* much," she spits. "Just go. Go before you help me any further."

      <DefaultText>This woman studies the Necropolis, ignoring you utterly. Something about her seems familiar, even though you've never seen her before. Something to do with... Caravanserai?

You shake your head. This isn't someone your predecessor knew, that's for certain. 

She feels your gaze and turns, eyebrows arched.

      <DefaultText>You recognize this woman from the description that Omahdon gave you in Sagus Cliffs. This is Perseia, Omahdon's 'lost love'. She certainly doesn't appear as confused as Omahdon made her sound. Instead, she's studying the Necropolis with a frustrated expression. </DefaultText>
