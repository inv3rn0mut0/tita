      <DefaultText>Slouched before you is a figure clad in a dusty, unremarkable robe. Loose folds of rough cloth shift to reveal a vaguely humanoid form with elongated facial features and two elaborate biomechanical arms. You can't help but notice the size, the shape, and even the number of its digits changing as it tinkers with a bizarre-looking device on the table.

It glances up at you. Its eyes are the size of your palms. You realize it is a visitant - a being from another world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The visitant's mechanical fingers race over the device before it, bending at bone-breaking angles to adjust and tweak the parts within. 

"Welcome back, fellow sentient. May I assist you with something?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah," it says. "You are hearing a brief elision in my name, correct? A majority of the component syllables are untranslatable or beyond human ranges of hearing. I will try to approximate them." It draws in a deep breath. 

"Snelanarga(with a brief poem about the ambient temperature of dust in moonlight here)gonthas(the word that describes a color similar to 'blue')ramalerf."

It shrugs. "I prefer the name your people hear. My name is all too common where I come from." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Greetings, fellow sentient," it says, nodding with studied respect. "I will be with you in a moment."

Its mechanical fingers contract and dance independently over the surface of the device before it, adjusting and tightening. 

"There. I am Sn'erf, guest of the Order of Truth. What brings you to my workspace?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A minor project of mine," it says, with a self-deprecating wave. "Something to widen the boundaries of my research. It scans for unknown reproductive processes and displays them for further study."

The device clicks to itself. "Ah," Sn'erf says. "Watch." 

A transparent image of two goat-headed humanoids appears over the device. At first, it seems they are wrestling each other. After a moment, you realize your mistake.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Deprived of the layers of sociological complexity, the process is quite simple," the visitant says. "At a certain age, my people ceremonially choose a limb for removal. The limb is grown into a new being. 'Children', in your terminology." 

It sighs. "This is where matters get more complicated. The selected part relegates the child to a caste. Arm-children become laborers. Leg-children become warriors. And head-children, due to the sacrifice implied in their creation, become leaders."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sn'erf studies its metal hands. "As I've suggested, the limbs we surrender do *not* grow back. In fact, those who replace their limbs insult their children and sin against their people."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I surrendered my arms to create my children," it says. "They grew to maturity and joined me in my study of various voidborne numenera. For a time, we were happy."

It lowers its eyes. "Then I discovered a melted humanoid figurine. I did no more than glance at its folded arms before it *opened its eyes*. That is the last thing I remember. I awoke with the arms you see now." Sn'erf sighs.

"My children, thinking I had disowned them, disowned me. And my people were even less merciful."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your sympathy is appreciated, but not warranted," the visitant says, though it is avoiding your eyes. "I have found other ways to take my mind off the loss of my family and my people since."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm not sure it was," the visitant says carefully. "My work was difficult at best when I lacked arms. Perhaps the artifact heard my frustration and sought to ease it."

Sn'erf shakes its head. "A moment's weakness can cost us so much. At least I have found other ways to take my mind off the loss of my family and my people."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I think I agree," the visitant says. "My work was difficult at best when I lacked arms. Perhaps the artifact heard my frustration, and sought to ease it."

Sn'erf shakes its head. "If that is the case, I did indeed deserve my punishment. Thankfully, I have found other ways to take my mind off the loss of my family and people since."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was only when I began visiting other worlds that I learned that most species do not reproduce by severing their limbs," Sn'erf says, shaking its head. "The discovery *fascinated* me. And so, I began cataloguing the various methods of procreation found throughout the void. It was only when I found my way to Sagus Cliffs, by way of the Bloom, that I was offered a place to work - here, in the Order of Truth."

"And there you have it," the visitant says, folding its mechanical arms.</DefaultText>

Once the host is drained of nutrients, the boil bursts, releasing a glistening flood of newborn pups."</DefaultText>

"In short, there is nothing wrong with the Foreman's 'body', and it wants to have children. Therefore, something in the intelligence's governing spirit - the sub-intelligence, if you will - must be blocking the energy transfer."

The visitant pats the cylinder. "Attaching this device to the Foreman should disable the sub-intelligence's defenses. Good luck."
