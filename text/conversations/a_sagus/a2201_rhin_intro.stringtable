      <DefaultText>Rhin has been hiding in the wreckage of a collapsed house, using it as a refuge to evade Tol Maguur while she's in the city proper. (Her reason for being in the city now, as opposed to the junkyard outside the city, could be anything - e.g., maybe Tol's thugs are looking for her out there). She is able to squeeze into a fissure in the collapsed structure that adults cannot, and she hides and sleeps in a little void underneath the ruin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rhin's initial scene could play out in a variety of ways, depending upon how the writer wants to introduce her. For example:</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>3</ID>
      <DefaultText>•	A couple thugs could be out in front of the fissure, trying to make her come out. Maybe they want to capture her as a slave for the Memovira, or they've heard that she has "powers" and think she might be valuable. The player could step in and scare them off - or fight them in a tussle (though this will be a Minor Abuse of Rhin, and she'll be upset if the player killed them). Then he needs to convince Rhin to come out of the fissure (though she's certainly more likely to trust the player after he helps her.)</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>4</ID>
      <DefaultText>•	Rhin could be inside the fissure, trapped by another partial collapse of the house (which happen a lot in Cliff's Edge). The player has a few different ways to help her get free.</DefaultText>

      <ID>5</ID>
      <DefaultText>Saving Rhin from her predicament (whatever it is) is the first kind thing anyone has done for Rhin in the Ninth World, so she'll bond to the player immediately and will want to travel with him. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>. If he refuses, she'll return to the collapsed house (though the player should be able to return here to retrieve her later). </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>Thus, Rhin will need a branch of this conversation for cases where the player has removed her from the party and she has returned here. She's not necessarily back in the fissure - she might just hang around near the collapsed house.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This house was reduced to rubble when part of the cliff face collapsed. There is evidence that squatters have slept here recently - a ragged blanket, rotted fruit peelings, and footprints in the dust itself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You crawl partway inside, pushing aside boards and a thin slab of slate. A small girl gasps, throwing up a hand to block the sudden light.

She's young, no more than ten or eleven years old. She has made herself as small as possible to fit inside the tiny gap in the rubble. Her hair is dark and curly.

She pulls herself deeper into the rubble, away from you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sighs. Dropping his facade, he turns to you with a look that pleads for understanding. "But, all right, yeah, there *is* a slaver who put up a fine bounty if we bring her back. It's all legal, and none of your business. Best you stay out of it."

      <DefaultText>The girl screams, tugging ineffectually at your arm as two of the thugs tear her away. It takes both of them to hold her still. She reaches for you, tears streaming down her face as they drag her away.

Her sobs continue to reach your ears long after she has disappeared from sight.
