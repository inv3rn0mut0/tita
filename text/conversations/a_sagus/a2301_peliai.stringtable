      <DefaultText>This violet-skinned visitant paces back and forth before the cavern's opening. It wears fine clothes that serve to accentuate the tall, thin crest on its head. A symbol has been painted on the crest, mirroring the insignia marked on its chest. Its clothes are finely tailored and well made.

The name of the creature's race crawls to your mind. It's a varjellen. This one has temporarily chosen to be female.

The player will have to take the eggs to the Order of Truth and see if they can turn them into power sources. (Peliai doesn't cover the cost in this case.)  </DefaultText>
