      <DefaultText>A small, hollow-cheeked mutant sings a soft, wavering tune to herself. Yellow bruises discolor her skin - wounds formed not from violence, but from malnutrition, and her prominent bones bend and twist at odd angles. 

Still, she smiles. She smiles at the oily water, devoid of any fish. She smiles as she arranges her empty basket beside her. And she smiles at you when she sees you standing over her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks up at you with a dazzling smile, but not fast enough to conceal the sorrow that was on her face before.

      <DefaultText>"Hello! I'm Crooked Qeek of the Cold Canyon Tribe. I haven't seen you down here before. I hope you're not here to fish. They're nibbling instead of biting today."

She coughs into her cupped hands, a raw and ragged hacking that bends her double. You take her for a child at first, but after studying her features it's clear she's in her late teens. It's only some mutation - and her bony stature, born of starvation - that makes her seem childlike. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No," she says lightly. "They're all gone. Either dead or... or gone."

She still isn't meeting your eyes. "There used to be a lot of us. We came here when I was a baby, running from..." she pauses, thinking. "A war. Some sort of war that never ends. My parents thought we would be safe here. But the tribe died off, one by one."

She turns away, wiping her eyes. "This city is hard on people like us." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You did? Piquo's alive?" She seizes your arm with cold, frail hands. "Is he doing okay? Is he happy?"

She seems to see the truth in your expression, and sighs. "He left after someone killed his father, and he couldn't get the levies to investigate. I don't really blame him, but... I wish he'd come back. I miss him." 

She releases your arm, and you see that her hands are trembling. </DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Could you? And maybe, could you ask him to visit when he can? I miss him a lot."

      <DefaultText>The little mutant is humming happily to herself. She looks much healthier, though you can't tell if it's the presence of her childhood friend or if she's managed to find something to eat since you last saw her.

"Look! Piquo came back!" She points at her dour friend with both hands. "And he brought some bread from the city. They put *nuts* in it up there!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Maybe!" she says. "Piquo went to get dinner. I thought I saw my fishing pole move, and I was trying to pull it up when I heard Piquo shouting."

Her eyes sparkle. "I turned around, and there was someone in Dendra O'Hur robes. I couldn't see his face, but there was something shiny in his hand. And then, Piquo chased him away! It had to be the one who's been murdering people in the Underbelly!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He was wearing Dendra O'Hur robes, and he had something shiny in his hand. I didn't see anything else. He ran off when Piquo started shouting."

She beams at Piquo, taking a deep, delighted breath. He blushes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sort of. My parents called me Qeek, but the nickname came later." She hunches over, her eyes darting shadily from side to side. "It's because I sell junk for high prices, and bribe the levies to carry people off in the night!"

She laughs. "No, not really. People call me 'Crooked' because I look twisted and broken."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The fish down there are pretty fast and smart. They're nibbling at the bait, then swimming away."

She watches the line with a combination of hunger and weariness. "It's hard for me to get to the pole in time when the rod twitches, and harder to reel in the catch. I'm not very strong."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Matkina?" she gasps. "That's not what people call her." She leans towards you, eyes as round as coins.

"They call her the White Death," she says. "She's an assassin. I don't know where she is, and I hope I never do!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They were used to living in the wilderness, so they knew what they could eat safely. Here, it's not so simple. My mother told me that ten people died eating tainted food before we found this fishing hole." She stares into the murky water. 

"Then there's the diseases you can catch in the city. And the hate. A lot of us were killed just for being... hard to look at, I guess."

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Mostly bad," Piquo grumbles. "We played games like 'Trash Ball', and 'Run or Die'. And that's not an exaggeration. We really could have died a few times."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It wasn't so bad," she says, nudging him with her foot. "But this one time? We found a hidden alley. An abandoned street buried beneath the Underbelly, full of sealed shops and empty houses. It had lanterns that glowed like purple stars."

She giggles. "We'd pretend we were normal and living on the streets above. Remember, Piquo?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yeah," Piquo says, regarding her with a mix of anger, sorrow, and pity. "Yeah, I remember." 

He looks over at you. "What do you think? Sound like a fun childhood to you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yeah," Piquo says, regarding her with an unreadable expression. "Yeah, I remember."

He looks over at you. "What do you think? Sound like a fun childhood to you? Hiding in the dark and *pretending* to be normal?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>She lowers her head, her hair making a cage of her pale face. After a moment, Piquo lays a careful hand on her bony shoulder. She clasps it. 

"I know," she says. "But I feel safer down here."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's gone," she says. "One time, we crawled through the little tunnel that came out alongside the bakery, and the town was gone. There was nothing but slimy stone and a broken lantern." 

She lowers her head. "I had the lantern for a while, but someone stole it a few years ago."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>She perks up, smiling at Piquo. After a moment, he returns it, and clasps her hand carefully, like someone trying to catch a bird without hurting it. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Piquo stands guard, glowering at everyone who passes - except you. For you, he manages a tight but genuine smile. When Qeek turns to the fishing pole, Piquo catches your eye.

"Thank you," he mouths. </DefaultText>

      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>The boy pulls you aside, and speaks softly. 

"If it was the murderer, we got lucky," he says. "I didn't chase him off. It was the shouting that made him run. If I'd walked up quietly, he might have killed us both."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I was almost killed!" Crooked Qeek says in scandalized delight, grasping you by both shoulders. "I don't know what would have happened if Piquo wasn't here!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>She blushes.

She coughs into her cupped hands, a raw and ragged hacking that bends her double. You take her for a child at first, but after studying her features it's clear she's in her late teens. It's only some mutation - and her bony stature, born of starvation - that makes her seem childlike. </DefaultText>
