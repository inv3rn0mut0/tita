      <DefaultText>The mutant boy gazes at the entrance to the chiurgical parlor, flinching at each scratch of razor metal on metal from within. 

By your estimation, he is in his late teens but is the size of a young, malnourished child. His arms are little more than bone wrapped in red-speckled skin, and a raw line zigzags down between his mismatched eyes and over his blade of a nose, as if pointing directly at his thin lips.

He sees you looking, and birdlike muscles flex in his frail jaw. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He toys with his hands, studying the entrance to the chiurgical parlor from beneath his lowered brow. 

"You're back," he says. Tension ripples through the studied calm of his voice. "Good."</DefaultText>

He chews his lip. "Fine. I'm scared, all right? I've had this... this ugly face, this body, my entire life. I've saved up to change myself. My future. Maybe I can become strong enough to deal with the people who h-hurt me. Or maybe I fix my face. It can do that, but then I'll still be s-small!"
