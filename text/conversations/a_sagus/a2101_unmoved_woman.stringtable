      <DefaultText>This woman stands at the back of the crowd, arms crossed and eyes cool as she watches the slow execution. Unlike the others, she's also watching the people in the crowd.

She shakes her head. "Depressing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She cringes, shivering. "A leader? I've never... no. You're right. That's why I'm here, and somebody has to do something. Why shouldn't that somebody be me? Why shouldn't I be the hero for once?"

      <DefaultText>Her pessimistic words stir your emotions. They simmer within you, and you know that you could shape them to your will and force this woman - *this whole crowd* - to think like you. If you want the people to rise up and free Ris, all you have to do is push.</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>The people in the crowd sway as the invisible force hits them. Their fists clench and their eyes grow bright.

The woman in front of you is transformed as well. She smiles at you, excited but not quite focused. "What was I thinking? Of course we can save him!"</DefaultText>
