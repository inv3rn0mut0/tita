      <DefaultText>"In fact..." She leans back for a moment and looks you up and down pensively. She nods once to herself, as if pleased.

"As I thought. No touch of a miserly nature in you." She offers you a sweet, shy smile. "We're going to get along just fine."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And you!" She turns to Rhin, crouching down so they're on the same level. "Wait, what's this?"

She reaches behind Rhin's ear. When Rhin turns to look at what she's doing Alcen taps her lightly on the nose. Rhin laughs. Alcen smiles.

"Such a gem! Yours?" She glances up at you. Her expression softens at the look on your face. She stands and takes your hands in hers.

"You're a good person," she says simply, looking into your eyes as if willing you believe it. Then she lets go.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zebb stares at you, overcome by terror. Alcen places a hand on his shoulder and he startles. His whole body tenses, as if he's about to run away, and then all of the energy drains out of him. He turns to face the gate. Its striating light throws his features into sharp relief.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Because I walked through it." She smiles at your reaction. "So, yes, I was an orphan and, yes, I'm from another time. One much earlier than the present. As a child I had the unique pleasure of being able to read history books and imagine that my real parents were the heroes of ages past." Her smile dims.

"And before you ask, my parents in this time are dead. But we spent many happy years together, and I will always be thankful for the life they gave me."</DefaultText>

"Rhin has one chance, exactly one, to go through this gate. I will not open it for her again. Do you understand? Will you swear on your life to take care of her if you take that chance away?"</DefaultText>

She shakes back her hair from her face and leaves without another word, stepping through the gate and disappearing in a blinding flash of light.

For several moments, all you can hear is the tick of cooling metal as the gate slides back into dormancy. Eventually, Rhin's afterimage disappears from your eyes.

Alcen looks at you, her face is carefully neutral. "This is not something you should put a child through twice," she says calmly, though you sense an undercurrent to her words. "You two must decide.

"Come on, dear," Alcen says, and gently herds Rhin toward the gate. There's a flash of light, and then the gate is empty again. 

Rhin is gone.
