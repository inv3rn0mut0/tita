      <DefaultText>For a moment, you are not entirely sure if you look upon a construct or a human. The plastic sheen of this pale man's skin suggests artificiality, but if he is a construct, he is so cunningly constructed, so close to the human baseline, that the illusion is nearly perfect... except his head is a trifle too large, his eyes black buttons.

Then you realize the truth. He is a visitant, his home many millions of miles distant.

He places a single hand across his eyes and then slowly slides it away. "The others began to see. And question. Questions gave way to self-doubt. Self-doubt gave way to self-hate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He lifts his great head slowly and fixes you with a dolorous gaze. "I am Almas. I am the Keeper of Souls. Last of my kind, only survivor of a civilization that spanned time and space. Now they are gone, their stars black. Reality's winds carry me."

      <DefaultText>"I wanted only to know. What is best? How do we become better? Not to tear us down. But I shone a bright light on behavior... on truth. But our center could not hold under truth."

His wet, terrified eyes fix on yours. "Was I to blame? Is civilization's end affixed on me? In dreams I see their faces. But not their minds."

      <DefaultText>His eyes flare, and the tears building within them vanish... replaced by a gleaming hardness. "Yes," he whispers. "Yes."

He slaps his hands upon the table. "Yes!"

He grabs your shoulders. "Connection restores itself. Doubt and fault, mine. A new civilization we build. Snatch old threads, place new minds. Extinction? Death? No. Immortality."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He steps away from the table and holds his hands out, palms skyward. Rainbows coalesce around him. 

An image echoes in your mind - fear and fetters, an unhesitating rule of annihilating will, subsuming individuality under a blanket of enforced vision. You do not see a web of connections, as he described... you see a net, a noose choking out the lives of millions.

He turns away from you, dismissing you.

      <DefaultText>... and then he crumples his fist. The energy vanishes. 

"I have severed the last connection. The last hope. If they exist still... they must exist without me. Let me be forgotten."

"No more," he whispers. "No more." He drops his head and weeps.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Horror dawns on his face. "Is this why I cannot feel them? Why I retain only an image?" He closes his eyes and concentrates, hard.
