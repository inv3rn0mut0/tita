      <DefaultText>Everything about this slender young man says *thug*, from his scar-slashed eyebrows to the callused hand hovering over his hip, where a dagger would hang... but he doesn't have one. Instead, flour cakes his hands, and a single apron string hangs from his pocket. 

He is, apparently, a baker.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sst!" he says, waving his flour-caked hands, his eyes wide with panic. "You don't *deal* with a levy. You don't even *talk* about it!"

He shoots another nervous look over your shoulder. "They're the law, right? You must've seen them. Always smiling, even if they're snapping the chains on." 

He swallows. "But not this one. No, he follows me around from dawn to dark, staring at me, trying to trap me in alleys. I ain't done anything wrong!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm a citizen," he says, as if this explains it. When it becomes clear it hasn't, he groans. 

"Every levy is made from a citizen," he says. "This one was made from me.  Look, I can't explain why, but I *know* that one's mine. I *feel* it, right? And now it's coming for me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Having a levy on your track is bad enough, right? But if he was *made* from a year of your life... he knows where you bed down, maybe... what you're thinking." He groans, rubbing his eyes. "That's worse. That's much worse."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look, he won't leave me alone, right? I gave a year of my life to make him, and I thought that was that. Now I catch him standing in the street outside the bakery. Whispering to himself. Playing with that carving of his."

His teeth graze his lip as he leans closer. "He even tried to talk to me. Levies ain't supposed to know who they came from, right? They ain't supposed to know who you are!"

He wavers, gathering his courage. "Could you... could you talk to him? Find out what he wants?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"By the Black Three, *yes*." His denial is swift and deadly serious. "I wouldn't nick a crust of bread... not anymore." 

He runs both hands through his hair, leaving streaks of flour. "He's after me, and I don't know why."</DefaultText>

"Look, you don't track a man for days and days unless you want something, yeah? Maybe you like his shoes or you're curious about how many shins he's got. Now, I don't have any shins, and my shoes are older than me. Only thing I got that's worth anything is my life!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He *what*?" Finzin says, going pale. "Keep your voice down. You tell anyone else about this? No? *Good*."

He lowers his voice. "I have to be, uh, unspecific about this, understand? Before I became a citizen, I was a... I wasn't a... nice person. I took things. For money. And just a few weeks ago, certain people told me they wanted me to rob Gillem Manor."

He grimaces, rubbing his neck. "I was going to do it. But then I became a citizen. Gave up a year of my life to create the levy... *that* levy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yeah," he says, looking away. "Didn't think I'd like it, you know? My aunt had me waking up early, carrying trays, counting out lumps of dough. Didn't think I'd last the week."

A smile spreads across his face, so slowly that he probably doesn't feel it. "But I like the smell, and the way the pastries brown up. And she's started letting me draw stuff on the sides, like flowers and cats and stuff."

He plays with the apron strings hanging from his pocket. "So I cancelled the job and started working at my aunt's bakery. Never did the Gillem job. And that's the truth."</DefaultText>
