      <DefaultText>Death. The stink of it, of dried blood and rotting flesh, fills your nostrils. 

This is your first clue that you are somehow still alive. The second is the glow of candlelight, warm on your eyelids, and the icy stone beneath your back.

Slippers scuff the ground near your head.

Despite the glare of the dim candles - which seem, at least momentarily, as bright as sunlight - you see a cluster of robed figures. Only the old man remains where he was, clasping his hands together with unfiltered delight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first glance, it would be easy to assume that the old man is dying of some wasting disease... or starvation. He is little more than a too-tall skeleton wrapped in translucent flesh and a tattered robe. His hands are essentially bony claws.

But those aren't the only two. No. You drift through countless lives, altering and ending them. Never leaving a name! Never *dying*!"

He draws in his breath. "Oh, I can't stand mysteries. Love them, but can't stand them. And so, I *must* ask you for a simply unthinkable favor."</DefaultText>

He looks down bashfully. "And now that we know you cannot die, well... would you do us the honor of letting us eat you? Just a little bit? If you do, we will share some of our deepest mysteries - and yours - with you!"

He folds his hands. "And we'll pay you, of course."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Imbitu and his followers lean over you in well-orchestrated unison, cutting slits in your flesh. Hoses dangle from their wrists, leading into their suits. They snake, seemingly of their own accord, into your incisions. 

For a moment, nothing happens. Then, you hear a faint whirring as spinning blades grind your organs, and suck the pulp up through the hoses. 

Someone is screaming, and you have a fairly good idea who. Eventually, mercifully, you die.

      <DefaultText>After an indefinite amount of time, you open your eyes. Imbitu sits beside you, reading a book. 

"Ah!" he says, setting it down. "Welcome back! What an *exquisite* experience that was... though I'm certain you don't need to hear about it while you're waking up!"

He beams. "At any rate! I took the liberty of adding a token of our gratitude to your belongings. Do come speak to me whenever you're ready to discuss what we learned from our little feast."

{GAVIN and GEORGE: Add the following information later in the project, given time: The Dendra might also refer to some of the experiences the player has had so far in the game (since they will have acquired some of the player's memories) and could make suggestions about (for example) things the player missed. . Additionally, Imbitu invites the player to learn the mysteries of the cult - if the player is interested, he should speak to Imbitu in private. }</DefaultText>
