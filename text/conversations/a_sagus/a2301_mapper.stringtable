      <DefaultText>The tattooed man glances up from his study of his maps. "You came back. What do you need?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What I mean is that Sagus got built on top of an old Sagus, and that got built on a Sagus before that. Before it was even Sagus, right? So this old sanctuary, it's in one of the spaces between the eras. But I haven't been able to find a way to get there, and friend, believe me when I say that's the kind of thing that carks me fierce."

He frowns. "Find the void, and you should be able to find his place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> He smiles broadly. "Of course, if you've made enemies of them, you'll need to find some other way to dig."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He is studying the meaningless swirls and whorls on his arms, and mouthing names that mean nothing to you. "Solvi... Balint... Urgau... Tentrees..." 

When he looks up at you, you see that a strange device covers one of his eyes. A deep blue light shines in its center, and it seems to measure and evaluate you as he focuses on you.

He smiles as you approach, a broad, beaming grin that says he considers you a friend already.

"I'm Mapper," he says, extending his hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From a distance, it looks as if this mutant is wearing a form-fitting suit of finely patterned lines in white, yellow, and pale blue. On closer examination, it becomes apparent that these are tattoos, and they cover nearly the entirety of his body... even his shaved head.

His actual clothes are simple and worn, and his boots look as though they've seen hard use. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>He is deep in study of the living map on his skin. He doesn't look up as you intrude, but you can feel a portion of his attention shift to you. "You're back! I hope the world opened its wonders to you... or at least showed you something new."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He slaps his face a bit, bringing some flush to cheeks, and smiles again.

"Anyway, I owe you a map, don't I?" He takes a big breath, and says, "The White Death is hiding in a place called the Cave of Last Words. It's an old thieves' bolt-hole. They say Chila herself used it, but they don't say where it is."

He smiles. "Persistence pays, though. That's always been my watchword."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>He laughs, delighted. "Is that supposed to be a challenge? Not far from Sagus, a big old spire of black rock glimmers and shines... but only under starlight. It seems to be balanced precariously on the cliffside, but it drives down deep into the earth. The sticha should find it ideal."

He scratches his head. "Frankly, I'm not sure why they're in the city in the first place, unless they're just being lazy. That spire's a much better spot for their kind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm looking for a woman named Matkina. Do  you know where I can find her?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Matkina? The White Death? I've heard of her. I know where she hides, too." He grins wide, exposing a mouthful of extraordinarily white and clean teeth. 

"I can tell you where she is, but I hate to say it comes with a price. Much as I love to talk about my travels, I need to finish a patch of my Sagus Cliffs map, and I need bragging rights for the next time I see the navigators." He shrugs. "Also, she might not be happy I've told."</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've been everywhere around here. I've found my way into places long-sealed and best-forgotten, met all sorts of people..." He frowns. "Can't say I cared much for some of them, it's true." His voice is fast, insistent, and incisive.

"Still, I try. The communities of our world are islands of light. Sometimes they wink out and sometimes they flare up. I want to link them together. I want to be a bridge." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He beams. "I travel. I go all over. I add to my maps. I learn places, inside and out, and they become a part of me." He laughs. "Why else does anyone travel, but to take a piece of their destination with 'em? Me, I just get more."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs, a faint smile on his lips. "I travel. I see places, I map them out on my skin... and maybe inside me, I don't know. I mean, the lines change when I look, and they've got to be stored someplace, right?" He scratches his bald head. The lines flow under his fingers.

"I just need to collect *places*. I need to know that I've done something. Making maps is all I know. It's all I *want* to know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"These? These are not tattoos. They're *maps*." He exposes a shiny grin. "Maps of places I've been, or heard of." He covers the artificial eye with his hand and says, "If I look at my skin like this, it's meaningless."

Then he uncovers it and says, "But look at it like this, suddenly... I *see* the map. Springing up off my skin. I focus on it, it all comes clear. Buildings, people, *smells*. Even a route to get there."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>His easy grin pops up. "You mean the maps? My life's work. I mean literally, heh? I go someplace, or I hear about someplace, and the lines start to curl and twist on my skin. I look at them through this -" he taps the lens over his right eye, " - and they come clear. They make *sense*. I know the world here. Any place I've been, I can look at my body and I'm there again." </DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>He laughs. "It's probably easier to ask where I *haven't* been. All over the Sagus Protectorate. The Oasis of M'ra Jolios. Valley of Dead Heroes. Kholn Village. The ruins of Archopalasia and all around the Black Cube. Tower of Birds, where Thirdloss fell. Even up past the Clock of Kala to Vralk."

As he speaks, the lines of his body shift and move, coming into prominence with the words. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks down at his stomach, and as his smiling gaze falls upon the lines, they start to flow and writhe. "Too many to count. Memories stack and overflow. But the maps paint the territory, make each place distinct, join the world together. Like Vralk, here - a place of blasted serpents, vicious plants, and evil people. Still, it has its own twisted beauty. Or take the Oasis, the water-bubble in the middle of the Lost Sea."

His eyes lose their focus. "I can see them even now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He blows out from his cheeks. "That's a good question, friend. A good question! If I knew, I wouldn't be asking you, eh? All I know is that it's in a void beneath the city."

He chews his tongue for a moment, thinking. "You know how cities build and build on themselves? It's like that."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd start beneath the city somewhere. Right beneath us, even. Maybe talk to the sticha. Maybe talk to the constructs. Who can say? It's a little frustrating, to be sure!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>He leans forward, and the blue eye begins to gleam more brightly. "Tell me about it," he whispers.

As you speak, Mapper stares at the exposed patch of flesh on his arm. New lines etch into his skin, unfurling themselves across the space. He smiles tightly and shifts in his seat. "Yes," he mutters. "Yes!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Murders? What murders?" Alarm colors his face, and a faint red streak runs through his tattoos. "No one tells me anything!" 

He sighs. "One of the drawbacks of being a drifter, I suppose. No one thinks to keep you informed."

Then he looks around. "Of course, in a place like this, people don't generally talk to each other much anyway."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, and now I've been listening. People have close lips. Trying to avoid being put to the question, I suppose, though I haven't seen any levies down here who might drag them away." He sighs. "But I'll keep my eyes out anyway. I've already annotated my maps."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Are you joking? Can you really? Tell me!" He stares avidly at you, his blue prosthetic gleaming. As you speak, a space clears on his skin and new lines pull themselves to the surface. 

He moans, as if in the throes of deep pleasure. "The sticha lair. Yes. Like I was there." The eye clicks and whirrs for a moment, and then he stares at the new tattoo. "That smell? Did you notice the smell in their lair? Like lightning and dust."

He smiles. "My thanks to you. You've done right by me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's worthless to anyone else, of course, without me to interpret the map. It's a combination of my mutation and the lens. Finding the eyepiece was the best part of being born like this." He sighs contentedly. "It made me feel like my life made sense at last, and that, my friend, is far more luck than anyone deserves."</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There's one way to get to it through the Caravanserai, but it's sealed tight, and I never found a way in. But you can get there from the underground. The sticha know. They dug there. They can dig there again."</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So here's the deal. You find the lost sanctuary of the Changing God beneath the city, and I'll tell y'where to find your assassin. I'd start by nosing around the sticha lair."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Why don't you go look for the sanctuary yourself?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is there some other way into the sanctuary besides the sticha lair?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The skist-sucking sticha, that's why. They've got their precious eggs in their lair, and they won't let me in. It's not like I've got any interest in the eggs, but... eh. I got no patience for dealing with their clicks and rumbles. I just want to *know*, got me?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs, exasperated. "There must be. Changing God wasn't the kind of person who'd just put one entrance into the place, but I haven't been able to find the back door for the life of me."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's fine, but y'won't get word of where to find the White Death without my help. I know where she hides. I know how to get there. Not about to give that information away for free."

He holds his hands up. "You should know that a side effect of these maps is that I don't feel pain. Just in case, you know, you get any ideas that there's an easier way."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <DefaultText>He's already started to return to his examination of his tattoos, and he responds absently. "Go ahead."</DefaultText>

      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Every place was a treat. An experience. Did you know most people never go more than fifty kilometers from the village of their birth, if that? I've been tremendously lucky, my friend." He smiles down at his maps.

Then he looks back at you, and says, more quietly. "If you plan to travel, I'd avoid the grasslands, though. The birds'll take your meat for their meals, and your bones for their nests."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He points to one line: "Here. In the void beneath the city. What's this in the mural?" He looks more closely at his arm and recoils. "Agh, gods, it's terrifying even from here!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>He rubs at his skin, as if trying to rid himself of the mural's image. His blue eye looks anywhere but at himself, and he shivers, bone-deep. "I don't envy you seeing that thing, friend. No, not at all."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I might be able to help you find it. For a trade, of course." 

He drops his voice. "Have you ever heard of the Changing God? Savior of Sagus Cliffs in times past and so forth? They say he had a sanctuary under the city, a place he used to retreat to and plan for the future while he thought on his past. You know... making possibility maps. That sanctuary is the one important place I haven't seen in Sagus Cliffs, and I need it to fill in my map."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As far as I can tell, it's not far past the sticha lair. The problem I'm having is that I just can't make any sense of their language. Maybe you can talk to them."

He shrugs disarmingly. "It's a hell of a price, I know, but there it is. You want to find Matkina, you'll find the sanctuary for me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sadly, no. The sticha live somewhere underneath the city, but they'd never let a human down there. You'd have to dig your own way down there yourself, I'd imagine."</DefaultText>
