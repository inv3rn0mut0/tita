      <DefaultText>Ris stands, eyes open, but seeing nothing, speaking an unending stream of gibberish. With each word a rope of slimy flesh inches from his mouth - and taking up this rope is a hideous doppelganger, seemingly made up of the same diseased viscera Ris spews, who paces around him, slowly wrapping him in it like a spider would bind its prey. 

Only a few rotting loops cinch Ris's chest. It looks like it will take a long time to cover him completely, but his 'twin' is patient, and it continues to circle him without complaint. </DefaultText>

The rotting entrails have entombed all of Ris's torso, making it hard for him to take a breath. His 'twin' is starting to wrap his neck.</DefaultText>

The rotting entrails are wound so thickly around Ris's torso and neck that they are crushing the breath out of him, and making him strain to speak every fevered word. It doesn't look like he has much longer.</DefaultText>
