      <DefaultText>"Hello, friend." A smiling, dark-haired woman greets you, standing behind a table of trinkets. Your eyes are drawn to the three small rodents that lazily orbit her head in three floating balls. They take turns hovering just out of reach of the half-mechanical, half-organic cat perched on the woman's shoulder.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Madelia's smile is as radiant as ever. The cat on her shoulder watches you warily for a moment, then goes back to batting at the rodent globes whenever they dip too close.

"Welcome, friend. Which of my treasures has called you here today?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hello..." The dark-haired woman pauses, eyes taking in the composition of your party - and especially Matkina - in an instant. "Friend."

She smiles at you from behind her table of trinkets. Your eyes are drawn to the three small rodents that lazily orbit her head in three floating balls. They take turns hovering just out of reach of the half-mechanical, half-organic cat perched on the woman's shoulder.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Madelia's smile is sharper than last time. "I see you found her." She sketches a quick bow toward Matkina.

"Be welcomed again, honorable lady. And you, friend," her eyes find yours. "Tell me, which of my treasures speaks to your heart?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hello, old fellow! I see you have found some friends to speak for you!"

The woman greeting Riastrad wears a dazzling smile, but it's the oddities floating around her head that are truly captivating. Three tiny rodents, each in their own stronglass ball, waver around her head in an indecipherable pattern. On her left shoulder sits a tabby cat with synthsteel legs, who bats lazily at the orbs whenever one ventures close enough.

      <DefaultText>The smile disappears from her face as a small tremor runs through the ground beneath your feet.

"That's the seventh time today." She glances nervously at the remnants of the structure next door. "When that one fell, I heard them screaming. Shrieking like the wind was tearing at their bones."

      <DefaultText>She idly turns a couple of the curiosities on her table so the light catches on the various planes and materials.

Then the smile returns to her face. "Come, tell me which of my treasures speaks to you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hello, friends." She smiles at you, but the smile she directs at Riastrad is just a touch warmer, and a moment sadder.

"Which of my treasures has called you here today?"

      <DefaultText>"It's all gone. Everything." She doesn't look up as you approach, only stares out at the ocean as if she can will her home back to the cliffside. A few objects are stuffed into the pockets of her dress - probably all she was able to save from her home. Her cat also remains, along with her rodents, which circle her head in somber silence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Friends! You are together at last!" Madelia's smile is as radiant as ever, though an unmistakable fondness enters her eyes when she looks at Riastrad.

"I am pleased for you. But if you are here, one of my treasures must have called to you. Tell me - which one was it?"

      <DefaultText>"You mean Bei, Bu and Bao?" She raises a hand and unconsciously pets one of the globes as it swings past her right ear. The tiny creature inside squeaks and scampers in a tight circle before the globe drifts out of sight.

"They are not for sale, my friend. I hope you are not too disappointed."</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"One of the..?" She unconsciously raises a hand to where the rodents, in their tiny spheres, revolve around her head. One by one, they touch her hand and the globes disappear, leaving the three tiny rodents sitting in her palm. The cat on her shoulder yawns and settles in for a nap.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They're...  They're not..." She leans forward and buries her face in her hands, sobbing silently. Eventually, she wipes her eyes and sits up, raising a hand without looking at you. The three rodents crowd into her palm again, squeaking anxiously.</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives you an odd look.

"Don't tell me why you're asking. I don't want to know. But in fact, I haven't. There are several small children running around at all times of day, but I couldn't tell you one from another."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>She raises both eyebrows, regarding you silently for a moment.

"You are either foolish or brave. I think the first. Yes, she was here, looking for help I could not give. She had a treasure of her own that she wished fixed. I declined. She did not take it kindly, but neither have I heard from her again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Bei, Bu, Bao. Hello again," she whispers, touching each of them with a gentle fingertip. They squeak appreciation at her attention, rubbing their cheeks against her finger as she looks up at you.

"They're not..." Her voice breaks. She tries again, but can't maintain eye contact.

"They're not for sale."

She raises her hand and, through a mechanism you don't spot, each rodent re-enters its stronglass ball and resumes its wavering orbit.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>She holds them close to her mouth and whispers words you can't hear. The rodents form a tiny circle, noses touching and twitching. After a few moments, she transfers one rodent into her other hand and returns the others to their stronglass globes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She glances up at you in surprise, attempting to smother her relief as she quickly returns Bao to her stronglass home.

      <DefaultText>Her body shakes with a suppressed sob as she leans forward and whispers another few words to Bao. Then she holds out her palm and demonstrates the mechanism that puts Bao into her stronglass home.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She folds her hands in front of her, head bowed as the two remaining rodents circle unevenly above her. The cat meows plaintively when Bao disappears from sight. Madelia makes no move to hush her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A forlorn woman stands by the edge of the cliff, only a few broken stones marking the remnants of a home that must have recently collapsed into the ocean. 

Three tiny rodents, each in its own stronglass ball, waver around her head in an indecipherable pattern. On her left shoulder sits a cat with synthsteel legs, who bats lazily at the orbs whenever one ventures close enough.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a few moments, she notices you, as if coming back into herself.

"Oh. Hello." She rummages in a pocket of her dress and produces a bundled cloth that she unrolls at her feet. A few trinkets gleam dully against the material.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You and Tranquility must be fast friends, I think," she muses, scratching her cat idly behind one ear. "Very well. I will listen, and move what I can. If you find a way to avert disaster, perhaps the knowledge of my discomfort will drive you to swift action, yes?" Her cheeks dimple as she smiles at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The color drains from her face. Wordlessly, she lifts a hand. Bao scampers onto her palm, whiskers twitching furiously.

Madelia's body shakes with a suppressed sob as she leans forward and whispers a few words to the tiny rodent. Then she holds out her palm and demonstrates the mechanism that puts Bao into her stronglass home.</DefaultText>
