      <DefaultText>The man is old and strong, his face lined with years of brutal experience. His face is aquiline, his nose sharp. He wears a broad-brimmed hat, and his voice is a low rasp.

"I'm Theboros," he says. "Tell me your story. Make it a good one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm the brains of this operation." He gestures with a lazy hand around the table. "Without me, they'd lose the thread of their thoughts and spend all their time wandering in dreams."

      <DefaultText>He tilts his glass toward them. "I love my colleagues here, but can they handle the Words of Qra? I don't think so. Right now I've got them locked into a mental construct no one has even the slightest idea how to build."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do you actually agree with Dhama that action is its own reward?" He seems particularly surly about this. "You know that good wishes don't get the landlord off your back, right? Satisfaction for a job well done doesn't magically bring food to the table? You and Dhama both, it's like you believe in a special world where people get by on the force of their good nature. It's not like that. Maybe in stories. Not here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm also the last person in the world to know the lost Words of Qra."

He closes his eyes tightly, and when he opens them again, you see worms of light dancing in his eyes. They're gone again with his next blink.

"They're a weaponized meme. A thought that sticks in your head, a tune you can't get rid of, a saying that echoes in your mind until it drives you mad and melts your brain."</DefaultText>

Theboros should comment about Riastrad (and Satsada) if the player asks about them, but he refers the player to Dhama (their closest friend amongst the war veterans) if the player wants to know where Riastrad is. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> If Dhama is already dead or gone (and the player hasn't learned what happened to Riastrad), he'll direct the player to Ziobe instead. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A psychic projection. That's an interesting way to word it, Z." He tilts his head toward Ziobe. "Couldn't you say that we're all psychic projections, in one way or another?"

He leans in. "Put it this way... are you always how I picture you? Does your behavior change based on my thoughts?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some damned fool of a nevajin found the scholar who'd released the words in the first place, still alive, still in prison. It released him, and he stumbled out into the world to unleash new horrors."

He closes his eyes and speaks softly. "I tracked the trail of the dead and dying. I took their pain from them, at the cost of their identity. Last of all, I found the scholar, and I... took his identity too. The Words of Qra, I trapped them in a maze in my mind. Only now I fear they're near the exit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He saved my life. He saved all our lives. For what? Did he think I'd pick up where he left off? That I'd change my ways and my thinking because of his example?"

      <DefaultText>He looks up at you, bleary-eyed and weepy, and says, "I've been thinking about our conversation. You know, the one where we were talking about recognition for our work. And I think Dhama might have been right. Gods know I'll remember him, and isn't it enough that we carry the memory of our friends? Who gives a single wet skist about what all those people out there think when the heroes are in here?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So you're influenced by my thoughts, but are my thoughts the whole of you? If they are, then you're my imagination, and the converse. You'd say we're one consciousness subjectively experiencing itself, and that means we're all each other's - and our own - psychic projections." He takes a slow, reflective breath.

"But we're also autonomous, eh? At least to some degree. You exist when I'm not paying attention to you - pretty sure I've no need to imagine someone like you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We might as well say that we're all interconnected at a fundamental level, that our thoughts and actions have effects on each other. It might not be reality - that is *the* truth, but we each have a perception of *a* truth. It's a guiding star that we use to live our lives. It's not reality for everyone, but it's reality for us. It's our *story*."

      <DefaultText>"Heh. So if you hear that I've been telling people that you're a tulky runoff and your body's full of skist, and I'm of a mind to cut you open to prove it, you don't change your behavior? Keep in mind, I've done nothing to you, in this example, not one damned thing. At least not in the physical realm. But I've affected you anyway, purely with the power of my thoughts and my words."

      <DefaultText>"Maybe just as well, unless you want to get into the philosophical self-satisfaction game. Like me." He cackles.

"You could argue both side of the case. You exist apart from me - at least I hope you do, or my world has got a whole lot stranger - and you exist *with* me, or else we wouldn't be interacting with each other by squirting words into the air."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hush, you. I'm lecturing."

He turns back to you. "Even if we don't understand reality, we understand stories. So maybe our best gauge for how we experience each other is through the stories we know and the words we use when we tell those stories."

He laughs. "What I'm really telling you is that I'm not Ziobe's projection. Maybe learn some of our tales and you'll get to the truth. *A* truth, anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can, but I won't. Talk to them yourself. They all have a piece of wisdom that they carry in themselves, and I won't dishonor them by telling their stories for them." He scratches under the brim of his hat. "I can eulogize them, but every story would start like... Here's a warrior, selfless and self-absorbed, knowing about themselves so they can help the world..."

      <DefaultText>He watches you intently as you speak, and when you finish, he nods sharply. "You're telling the truth," he says. "A lot of people embellish, or they lie outright. Try to pretend they're more than they are so people will remember 'em as giants... more often than not, they just end up looking ridiculous."

He pats you on the shoulder. "You've given me a rare treat. Thanks. So. What do you want? Can't help you with your chamber, but maybe there's something else."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He is watching you as you speak, and he laughs as you finish. "A good lie, but you need to control your tells.

      <DefaultText>"Yeah, sure, do it because it feels good, that's fine. But in the end, you're playing with yourself, giving yourself a good solid stroke of the ego. If that's all you want from your life, go right ahead. Me, I'd prefer to eat a piece of bread that ain't moldy.

He turns back to you. "I'm... let's call me a warrior of language. Words are my weapons and my treasures. They might be pretty sounds to you, but to me... they're the tools that pry open your imagination and leave you vulnerable to my friends here.

      <DefaultText>His long face grows more somber, if that's possible. "Those words were the ruin of an ancient civilization. I had this story from a dying nevajin, before I wrested the last word from its mind."

"Goes like this. The scholarchs of that age had found deep truths about the world, and they stumbled across these words. They wrote the knowledge down and sealed the words away with the strongest warnings they could find, and then they killed themselves so that they wouldn't infect their kind."</DefaultText>

He snaps his mouth shut and rolls his eyes back into his head. Sweat beads on his brow.

At last, he releases his breath in an explosive gasp. "Almost got away from me there. Measures and counter-measures work. Rational thinking. But it's..." He rubs his eyes. "Hard."</DefaultText>

"Have you ever killed a nevajin?" He closes his eyes and speaks softly. "I hadn't, til then. They're kind creatures. Wise. I took their pain from them. I ate the Words of Qra, trapped 'em in a maze in my mind. Only now I fear they're near the exit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Got to tell you, it's a real burden off my mind to get the Word out of there. Not many people could contain it, so I'm trusting you. Hells, humanity here in the Protectorate is trusting you. Be mindful of your duty." He nods. "It's a heavy weight, but I think you're up to the task."

He stifles a chuckle. "You and I, we're part of the same story now, eh? Hope you make yours a good one."</DefaultText>

We're looking for a way to stop that Adversary, and if you're not willing to help, get the hell out of the way and leave the professionals to do their work. If you want to help, your aid's welcome. But I'm not the one you should be talking to."</DefaultText>
