      <DefaultText>The machine hums softly. An orange glow appears beneath its dark, glossy surface. A large alien symbol dominates the space, with words in a smaller script on the side, but you cannot understand the writing. Even so, it feels like you've seen the writing somewhere before.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The omniscope's readout blooms into being again. An inhuman handprint dominates the space. Next to it is a list of locations and a shorter list of approximate dates. One item from each list is already selected.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After studying the text for several minutes, you begin to see - or perhaps simply remember - patterns in the words. In a flash, the purpose of the device comes back to you.

This is an omniscope, a device used to view locations from afar. The large alien symbol is actually an inhuman handprint. The longer list next to it is a set of location names, and the shorter list denotes ranges of time - how far back in time the omniscope should look. You discover that you can actually read them all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The meaning of the script eludes you, but you can see an organization to the elements of the readout.

The strange symbol that dominates the readout is a handprint - albeit not a human one. There are two lists next to it: a longer list of text and a shorter list of what you believe to be numbers.

Each list has one item highlighted. You feel fairly certain that merely touching a new item will select it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The screen shows an area north of Sagus Cliffs, below the crag of the city, where the land stretches out to the horizon. Amidst a maze of bluffs and outcroppings is all manner of debris, most of it predating the Ninth World.

Metal and synth monoliths rise above a field of scrap. A functioning machine perches on the edge of an enormous pit. Strange plants and vines struggle to reclaim the land. It's even more cluttered and fantastic than the Reef of Fallen Worlds.</DefaultText>

Scavengers come and go. The enormous pit grows slowly larger. 

In the more distant past, a wall stretches across the junkyard, bristling with northward-facing batteries to protect the city from attack. But as time passes, the wall is abandoned, the batteries crumble into ruin, and the whole structure is subsumed beneath the surrounding trash.</DefaultText>

The further into the past you look, the farther north the Bloom is. It looks like it is moving very slowly south over time - less than a finger's length per year - toward the sea.</DefaultText>

The Bloom sees a lot of diverse traffic - merchants, refugees, and the destitute. A number of shady figures enter and exit, mostly through a stone gatehouse that is partially subsumed within the mass of flesh. Not a single levy or Sagus official ever seems to travel there.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Merchants and other scattered figures travel along the Bloom's tendrils. A stone gatehouse, partially subsumed within the mass of flesh, would seem an obvious entrance, but very few are coming or going through its gates. 

A number of scavengers sift through the debris outside the Bloom, tossing most of what they find into one of the Bloom's many orifices.</DefaultText>

In the darkest part of the chasm, beneath a cloud of greasy smoke, is a city-sized mass of living flesh... the Bloom. Its name springs readily to mind, plucked from your sire's memory.

Tubes and tendrils sprout from the Bloom in a hundred directions, many of them attached to the cliffs on either side.</DefaultText>

The further back in the past you look, the more buildings there are. They have been falling gradually into the sea over many centuries.

Above and below, there are seaward-facing batteries - defensive weapons that predate the Ninth World - but they too collapse into the sea as the years pass. Shortly before the "distant past" ends, the last of them topples from its perch, leaving the city defenseless.</DefaultText>

Centuries ago, there was some kind of rebellion. It spilled out from the Bloom up to the highest parts of Sagus Cliffs. Leading the charge is a woman wielding a glowing hammer. She is covered entirely in silver scales - she doesn't even have a face that you can see. Her followers are numerous, and the leaders of ancient Sagus are quickly killed or subdued.</DefaultText>

Buildings rise and fall as time passes. One in particular catches your attention. It is built from purple rock and rises perfectly straight, perhaps fifty stories tall. On its side is a magnificent mural of a creature - or perhaps a tree or a storm - but you feel certain it is a creature. Perhaps *the* creature, the Sorrow that is hunting you.

The building stood for centuries before it was torn down.</DefaultText>

The most interesting occurrence in this time frame is when you fell. There is a bright flash. You can see Aligern and Callistege watching the skies, then Aligern twists his hands in the air, sending multi-colored energy up into the sky.

Seconds later, a white streak - encased in the same energy - slams into the crystal dome at the edge of the Reef.</DefaultText>

The docks have been a bustling center of trade for as far back in time as you can see.

In the earliest recorded time, you can see two figures standing atop this very observation platform - a male and a female. Bright flashes and gouts of smoke suggest a great battle taking place along the cliffs below, until the man activates something on the control panel, a faint veil of energy encircles the city, and the tumult suddenly ends.</DefaultText>

You catch a glimpse of a woman with purple hair and slow the images down to watch. She stands near the entrance to the hostel, speaking to the proprietress. After a moment, she embraces the woman. Then she hurries off toward  the docks.

The woman's hair seems to move of its own accord. She is almost certainly the woman that Omahdon described.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There are three numbers here, representing a rough time frame - perhaps days, months, or years. The numbers are strange, but you are fairly certain you understand their meaning. Selecting one will presumably direct the omniscope to look at that time frame.

      <DefaultText>Little else changes until you reach images from many centuries past. Massive war constructs crawl across the Reef, firing weapons toward the city above. One of them is struck by a blast from a defensive battery, and it collapses into the crystalline water. As it settles, you recognize its back as the place where you met Qorro.

There is nothing before that assault upon the city. When you try to look further into the past, the images loop back to the present and start over.</DefaultText>

A long time ago, the cliffsides had defensive batteries built into the rock. All of these have collapsed or fallen into ruin.

An enormous marteling whale glides into the bay with a small village built on its back. Before it can reach the cliffs, a fountain of blood spurts from its head. It howls mournfully, then sinks into the waters.</DefaultText>
