"So. The Changing God. He made us. Maybe not on purpose, maybe we're just an accident, but he made us. He uses the Tides to transfer his mind. You've felt them, I'm sure - surges of power, emotion, whatever. That's the Tides, and they're pushing around inside you.

She breathes out. "Close your eyes. Feel that coiling power in you? That's the Tides. Now feel this. I'm going to push a little power at you. Try to fight it off."

With your eyes closed, you can *see* the energy emanating from her, a dark and angry spike of red-hued power that drifts toward you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>333</ID>
      <DefaultText>Instinctively, you raise your hands to bat it away, and she snorts. "With your mind. Use your Tides."

As the Tidal dagger drifts closer you feel something inside you uncoiling, a vast and restless power whose depths you can barely comprehend. It's reminiscent of the energy you used to blast the Sorrow fragments from your mind. But now you can control it... and you breathe out, pushing her probe away.

"That's it," she says. "That's it. Practice that."

She pushes away. "We're done."</DefaultText>

She looks at Rhin, and you feel some intangible emotion building around Tol's head - longing, despair, baffled rage, and more - and she sighs deeply. "All right, Rhin. This here's your new owner. Paid the price fairly. You be... be a..."
