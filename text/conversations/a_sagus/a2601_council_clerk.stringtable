      <DefaultText>Behind a lectern, a four-eyed, hairless mutant processes paper with balletic grace. He's endlessly snapping the elegant fingers of his left hand, and each time the air twists and shimmers, either disgorging a document to be processed or accepting one that he's completed with his ink-stained right hand. 

Each of his eyes regards a distinct object: portals that are opening, preambles and recitals that must be reviewed, his own addenda that must be flawless. One eye twitches in your direction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The clerk hesitates for a moment, then shrugs. "It happens that the letter was consigned to destruction by year's end, anyway, given the confirmation of Cardin's demise." 

With a snap of his fingers, a letter appears, and he looks it over. "Yes, yes, here we are. Quite the criminal he was, and no slouch in treason. But who am I to question the clemency of our peerless Council?" He hands it to you with a slight sniff.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The clerk sniffs. "*Paper* governs Sagus Cliffs - paper allows the few to rule over the many, paper allows the many to organize into a single whole. Authority resides in diktats, compacts, agenda... the means by which thoughts are refined, disseminated, and preserved."

In a calmer voice, he adds, "Of course, the Council has a part as well. Each of the great Slave Families sends a representative, and they dicker and bicker until they form the will embodied in paper. And *I* am their clerk."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why, exactly, would an overburdened clerk be able or willing to recite this city's sad tale of decline?" Then, a certain twinkle appears in all four of his eyes, and he begins to speak.

"Here is what the documents themselves reveal, not in their words, but in their very selves." He works faster as he tells the story. "Centuries ago, when the Ninth World was fresh, the city began. Its founders kept meticulous records - all lost. Only the columbarium that held them remains."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Without looking your way - and with feigned, sneering excitement - the clerk recites: "An age of lords and ladies! A war against the fierce Tabaht hordes! One slave's brave stand for freedom! Expansion and retrenchment!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've seen the name," he mutters, "in far too many requisitions for 'discretionary funds.'"

With confident but deliberate speed, he reviews a series of documents, which seem to confirm his initial impression. "She does not appear as a citizen, nor in any census. Indeed, she is mentioned nowhere but on ledgers and requisitions."

Fully three of his eyes give you a significant look: "Needless to say, these are transactions whose nature is not specified."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Without hesitation, he answers, "I do not because, as it happens, they are sealed even from me. Naturally, I inquired of the Council why such an extraordinary measure would be in place. Unnaturally, they gave me no reply."

He shakes his head, "In governments no less than in men, it is a sign of derangement to try and hide shameful memories from oneself."</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Loss-of-self?" One eye glances to see if you're joking. "I recall no such name." He snaps his fingers and a sort of living codex appears, each of its pages covered in intricately patterned fur. Caressing its spine, he turns to a page, nods sharply, then returns codex to its portal.

"As I knew, the census holds no such name. Perhaps that is merely an alias." With the eagerness of one who would prove his system cannot be thwarted, he adds, "We will need another way to find her records."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The clerk listens to your description, then gives a decisive nod, muttering something about checking the "onomasticon." He snaps his fingers and a heavy, lead-bound tome appears from nowhere. He turns to a page, nods again, snaps again, and takes hold of a vellum scroll.

As he unrolls it, an involuntary cry escapes from his lips. "Impossible!" You can see that the scroll is badly damaged by patches of gray-green mold.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The clerk looks at the contract and shakes his head. "Well, each must ply his own trade, and the work of the mind is not suited to all hands."

He snaps his fingers once, files the contract away, then snaps them again and conjures up a bag of shins. He rattles it once - perhaps in mockery, perhaps to somehow count its contents - and then hands it over.

      <DefaultText>"Rhin, Rhin, Rhin," the clerk mutters to himself, shuffling papers in and out of portals. "Aha!" he cries at last. "I knew I'd seen that name."

He reads with one eye on the folio he has just snatched from elsewhere, his other eyes ensuring that Council work carries on uninterrupted. His lips move but you cannot quite make out his subvocalization. Finally, he closes the folio, snaps his fingers, and sends it back into the archives.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One moment," the clerk mutters, shuffling papers in and out of portals. He skims them with one eye, his other eyes turned to the Council work that does not pause, or even slow.

"Yes," he says. "Rather typical, really - a birth certificate, some reports from the levies, a notation in a creditor's lien. You should be able to find him over at Cliff's Edge with his sister Nym. The mother's dead, the father's a throat-cutter for the Memovira, if the levies have it right."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am neither a tourist attraction nor a docent," he sniffs, but the irritation in his voice is only a thin disguise for the obvious pleasure he takes at your interest.

He elaborates, "I am the Council Clerk, and unto me falls the responsibility of directing the fate of every official document in Sagus Cliffs." His tone becomes wholly boastful as he continues. "I am the mind that channels the blind, nervous impulses of this city and turns it into muscular action."</DefaultText>

      <ID>79</ID>
      <DefaultText>Exaggerated scorn twists his mouth, and though his eye remains fixed on your face, he gives no verbal acknowledgment. The closest he comes is a faint sigh.

At last, after shunting a half dozen more documents to some distant cubby, he condescends to speak. "You must wait, of course, until Council matters conclude." His quarter-gaze leaves you, his face returns to its former equanimity, and he continues his work, which shows no evidence of slacking, let alone concluding.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The clerk rolls his idle eye skyward, then answers in a voice that feigns having been worn down by endless pestering petitioners - though as far as you can see, you're the only one bold enough to bother him.

"Consider in so vast a city what ordinances must be registered, contracts memorialized, indictments docketed, discoveries catalogued, edicts promulgated, memoranda routed, applications processed, permits issued, titles recorded.

      <ID>105</ID>
      <DefaultText>The clerk continues his masterful shuffling of papers from one portal to another, flicking a closed scroll through a gateway with a particularly deft gesture. Then, he turns not one but *two* eyes your way.

"If you are inquiring whether I would let your sweating butcher's fingers touch the Council's paperwork, I fear for the state of your mind." His eyes look away, and he adds, "Of course, it is customary to render a small gratuity in thanks to civil service." One eye quickly glances back.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>107</ID>
      <DefaultText>All four of the clerk's eyes momentarily open wide with dismay. "Of course not!" he cries, aghast. "Receiving a bribe is a criminal act, as set forth in Sections 201 and 1951 of the Criminal Code! By contrast, accepting certain customary payments is an understood and lawful emolument associated with this position."

      <DefaultText>For all the clerk's sharp-eyed focus and uncanny speed, you manage to slip past his guard and knock a document astray. Before he can react, it twirls through the wrong portal - perhaps a slave's manumission is now consigned to a vault of subversive texts; perhaps a madam's complaint about a client slipped deeply into arrears has found its way into the public record.

      <DefaultText>He preens, adding a certain flair to his routing of the paperwork. "Nature, of course, provides every being with its proper niche, and here my power to bend space, my divisible vision, and my unerring integrity allow me to carry out a task no other in the Ninth World could possibly undertake."

He sighs, but with rapture, not exasperation. "A venal man, a distractible man, an *ordinary* man would break beneath the temptation and strain. But not I."

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, the world changes.

You're in a laboratory that reeks of spoiled milk. In a vat before you - floating in gray, viscous fluid - is a very young child. His skull is in your hands, and you're kneading and stretching it like dough. Two nubbin eyespots stare from above his natural eyes.

He's howling. As he clenches and unclenches his tiny fists, oddments appear and disappear: a blue rag; a gourd rattle; a lock of black hair.

      <DefaultText>Your words are enough to stop the clerk in his work - if only for a moment. All four eyes stare at you, probing, searching for a smirk on your lips or a twinkle in your eye. 

Finding nothing, he resumes routing the city's papers, but some of the grace is gone from his long fingers. At last, he sniffs, "Next, no doubt, you'll jest about bedding my mother." His forced tone reveals he took it for no joke; but, for all his gift in filing, he seems unable to fit what you've told him into his mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A time of aristocrats followed. Each paterfamilias traced his lineage to ancient heroes and inscribed these lies in stone. Today, those tablets pave the midden heaps built in the wake of Chila's rebellion." He clucks his tongue is distaste. "That came later."

"First came the Tabaht, and as they laid siege to Sagus Cliffs, the city's records degraded - like hygiene and decency, proper documentation falters in long years of terror." With a shrug, and no detail, he adds, "But the siege failed and the Tabaht vanished."</DefaultText>

"Chila cast down the old lords and raised up new Slave Families. An empire expanded, contracted. Holidays and boulevards changed names - all else persisted, corruption most of all."

      <DefaultText>He snaps his fingers, opening a portal and flicking a scroll through it. "Before I undertook this role, the Council employed layers and layers of logothetes, scriveners, registrars, and couriers - each corruptible, vulnerable, insular. The Memovira's tendrils grew through the cracks in that teetering edifice."

      <DefaultText>"There is, of course, a wealth of information - taxes paid, licenses obtained, a letter patent - but you do not strike me as a demographer or city planner." A condescending smile curves his lips.

"No doubt you seek her grave, to rob it of the treasures of antiquity. I assure you there will be none. She dispersed her wealth, mostly in endowment of an institution known as the Hospice."

He looks at you with one eye, and decides to give you something more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It seems she was a toymaker. A formal commendation issued from the Council - 'In acknowledgment of one who has brought joy to the young hearts of Sagus Cliffs, and young hearts to the old.'"

    <Entry>
      <ID>181</ID>
      <DefaultText>He eyes you for a moment, reading something on your face. "I can't fathom what you were expecting. There's nothing more. It's hardly a common name, though to be sure the child has a common enough lot. Come back in a few years, and I'm sure there will be a magistrate's judgment against him, if not a death certificate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Voice quivering with panic, he says, "These records are stored in a sealed chamber, housed in niches carved from solid salt." He shakes his head.

"There's little left. If this is your woman, I can tell you only that she was born in the city, and that her family was searching for her."

You, and your request, are forgotten as he begins systematically checking every other scroll in the vault, one snap at a time. None of the others appear damaged, though there seem endlessly many to examine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The clerk sighs in exasperation. "A well-ordered city is a powerful, implacable machine. A passer-by cannot change its operation merely by jumping up and down and shouting. Nor does a mere cog have the power, or volition, to act on its own. Rather, one must cry out to those whose hands are on the levers of power."</DefaultText>

He plucks an example from the air, a regulation concerning the stabling of aneen. "You see?" He sends it back whence it came. "And then, abruptly, the annotations are in blue ink."

"Whereas... assuming... law and equity... ahhh," the clerk mutters. He lays the sheet down, embosses it with the Lesser Seal of Sagus Cliffs, then passes it to you.

      <DefaultText>A moment later, he purses his lips and shakes his head with mock consolation. "His lordship is indisposed," he laments, handing you the note. "It seems whatever debt you were owed has been repaid already."

Indeed, the note says little more: "My master reports that he feels matters are now concluded to all parties' adequate benefit, with no further obligations ensuing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The clerk scowls without looking up. "Some builders raise monuments of marble.

      <DefaultText>You feel him writing something on the document, presumably Ris's name, before slipping it into your pouch and giving a polite little cough to catch the Council Clerk's attention.

      <DefaultText>The clerk turns a single, angry eye Tybir's way.

      <DefaultText>Irritation twists the clerk's mouth, and he focuses his multiple eyes fully upon his work. Tybir slips a vial from his sleeve and dabs his finger into the silvery liquid inside. This he swipes across the name of the condemned, which dissolves before your eyes.

"Bend over," he hisses, stepping between you and the clerk.</DefaultText>
