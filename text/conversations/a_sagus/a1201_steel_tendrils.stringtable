      <DefaultText>A tangled cluster of metallic tendrils grows from the depths of the nearby water. Strangely, they resemble clawed, alien hands, most of which have seven or eight fingers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The 'hands' of this plantlike growth tinkle gently against one another. They have more fingers than a human hand - you count seven or eight digits on most of them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grip the hand nearest to you and snap it from its roots. 

Stepping back, you give it a couple experimental swings. Good balance - it might make a decent weapon.

{SOUND: One of the metal hands is snapped off the steel "vine." The hand is about the size of a mace.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grab hold of one of the wrists and pull with all your strength, but the stem is stronger than it looks. Hidden layers of thin, incredibly sharp spines - some sort of defense mechanism - emerge from the metallic surface and pierce your flesh, burrowing into the meat beneath. 

The pain quickly subsides, replaced by a numb but oddly pleasant sensation. You feel an icy liquid flowing - hardening - over the bones and tendons of your arm. When you clench your fist, veins of steel shine through the bloody skin.

      <DefaultText>You grab hold of one of the wrists and pull with all your strength, but the 'stem' is stronger than it looks. Hidden layers of thin, incredibly sharp spines - some sort of defense mechanism - emerge from the metallic surface and tear open your flesh, burrowing into the meat beneath.

The throbbing pain subsides slowly, replaced by a numb but oddly pleasant sensation. You feel an icy liquid flowing - hardening - over the bones and tendons of your arm. When you clench your fist, veins of steel shine through the bloody skin.

      <DefaultText>You try to lean around the nearest palm and notice that it innocently moves with you, as if guided by a wind that's not there. You feint right and go left instead, just in time to see what the hand was trying to hide. 

One of the lower hands is passing a small, silvery object - a seed pod - to another.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>None of the hands are trying to pass seed pods around anymore. They've likely hidden them from you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The 'hands' sway softly, but their movements are difficult to follow. Watching them for too long makes you feel nauseous. 

Apart from the 'hands' themselves, you don't notice anything of interest in the cluster.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You wrap your hands around one of the wrists and pull with all your strength. 

Eventually, gasping, you give up. The tendrils seem thicker and stronger now, as if they fortified themselves against you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You wait for an opening, then snatch the pod as it passes from one hand to another. Immediately a wave of outrage washes over you from the cluster's direction.

      <DefaultText>You try to snatch the seed pod, but the hands somehow detect the motion. The seed pod is swept away by other hands before you can get to it.

You don't see any other seed pods after it. It seems the hands have learned not to trust you.</DefaultText>
