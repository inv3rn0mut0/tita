      <DefaultText>"After Lhauric, we lived from meal to meal, eating only what we could steal. Canadu grew into his strength and I... grew, but less obviously. I began studying, you see. I read ancient texts about my lost home, and the sickness that possesses it to this day. I thought about how I could *cure* it," he says, clenching his fist.

"So we began exploring ruins. We sold the broken relics we found for food and equipment. Kept the interesting ones for future study."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Canadu and I were born in the gray outskirts of the city. I'd like to say we were childhood friends, but we weren't. We simply came to know each other through what we lost."

El-Jinto takes a breath. "The priests of the million gods of Lhauric wandered the streets seeking sacrifices, you see, and opposing them was - is - a sin. In our first ten years, they claimed our parents, then our friends. And then, one day, a pockmarked priest came for me."  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He hauled me up the glass-paved streets. I wept and screamed, but the faithful - and the fearful - turned away. I'd almost lost hope when I heard the hammer scraping on the glass."

He smiles. "Up charged Canadu, bearing his father's sledgehammer. With a shout, he dashed the priest's brains from his skull, and we ran." He shuts his eyes, smiling. "And we've been running ever since, but we will return one day, I think. Armed for the occasion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I suppose you could blame luck," he says. "Little early to call it 'good' or 'bad', though." His eyes seek the sky as he begins his story. 

"I was working on... well, call it a trap, in a valley through some nameless ruin. Canadu was off hunting for dinner, and I work in a daze. Always do, when I'm concentrating." A smile flits across his face. 

"Near sunset, the trap was still in pieces, and I heard Canadu roaring my name. I turned just in time to see our guest bearing down on me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The creature's volley of molten energy cracked off the personal barrier I'd left active while building the trap, but I knew it couldn't hold. Then, Canadu leapt off the valley edge onto the nychthemeron's back, bashing it with his hammer. It shrieked and then... night fell, and the creature went still."

El-Jinto shrugs. "I worked - a touch frantically, I admit - to finish the trap. It hadn't been designed for our guest, but as you can see..." He gestures at the creature. "It worked."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He accepts the crystal shard with great care, turning it over and over in his cracked hands. In the silence, you catch a hint of woodsmoke, and notice that his eyes have turned slate-gray.  

"Living crystal," he mutters at last. "Seeking a greater whole. Still warm... maybe alive, maybe thinking."

He hands the shard back to you with a touch of regret. "Interesting piece of tech, but not one I know much about. Sorry, friend. Try asking around some more."</DefaultText>

He swallows, and reclaims the thread of his thoughts. "We searched countless places for the components I needed for my trap - yes, the one our guest is contained in - and we headed east, into the Clock of Kala."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We easily spent a decade searching the base of the peaks for the final parts of the trap," he said. "At last, we heard a rumor - a horde of ghosts occasionally stampeded through the lands of Augur-Kala, bearing relics, and smearing reality in their wake. This last detail was what interested me," he says, raising a finger.

"I created a device - a bell, of sorts - that would attract the ghosts' attention. And when they came, there stood Canadu, hammer ready."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The bell drew them, you see. But it also made them more *real*. Canadu waded into the ghosts, striking them down. The rest fled, but we had found the materials I needed for the trap. The trap I'll use to capture a god."

A wide smile spreads over his face. "Beneath Lhauric lies a mad being who demands the sacrifice of mothers, fathers, and children. Once we free our guest here, we will return home with this trap. We'll use it to kidnap a god or die trying." </DefaultText>

"Thank you for taking an interest in an old man's stories," he says. "I'd like to return the favor. Normally, we charge quite a bit for visits to the nychthemeron's cage. You, my friend, can see it for free."

He gives Canadu a complicated whistle. The big man raises his eyebrows, rolls his eyes, and nods. </DefaultText>

"I was working on the trap we've spoken so much about, in a valley through some nameless ruin. Canadu was off hunting for dinner, and I work in a daze. Always do, when I'm concentrating." A smile flits across his face. 

"Near sunset, the trap was still in pieces, and I heard Canadu roaring my name. I turned just in time to see our guest bearing down on me." </DefaultText>
