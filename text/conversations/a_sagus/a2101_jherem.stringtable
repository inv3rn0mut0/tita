      <DefaultText>The words tickle your memory. Your eyelids flutter, and...

You see hands - not yours - carefully turning the crackling pages of an ancient book. The roving eye catches the words "mard" and "siro" - old, old words for "mother" and "father".

Blinking hard, you focus on Jherem once more. He does not appear to have noticed your sudden fugue, but he is not looking at you either.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Jherem's face goes white.

"I... uh. I'm not allowed to tell adults about that. Or about where I'm from." His gaze steals to Paja and Kellenor, both of whom are suddenly taking a greater interest in your conversation. "Don't ask, hey?"

      <DefaultText>"I have, but not since I was young," Aligern says, smiling at the boy. "Kids are saying that again?"

When Jherem nods quickly, Aligern glances at you, his smile fading into his customary scowl. "It's slang from an older dialect, kid. My grandfather used it when *he* was young. They'd get outsiders coming through the village, dealing tough with the merchants and shoving kids aside as they went about their damned important business. Shuva. Get it?"</DefaultText>

"It's a nickname for adults, not a mean one - not really. Some adults are nice to kids, right? Pat the head, here's a flower, a bit of gnash, whatever. But some aren't so nice.

      <DefaultText>A wave of dizziness clutches at you, and you close your eyes to steady yourself.

You kneel in a basement, amid rotting rolls of carpet and broken furniture. A stack of paintings, draped in dust and mold, lean against the sweating wall. The painting in front displays the building Jherem is speaking of. But through this body, this mind, you remember that it was torn down centuries ago to build a forgotten ruler's palace. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yeah, you will," Aligern mutters, studying Jherem from the corner of his eye. "Scarrohall was a huge temple at the center of town, like he says. It was torn down centuries ago. Kid's either a liar or a carker."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We might," Callistege whispers, studying Jherem with something like concern. "The Scarrohall was a grand temple at the center of town, like the child says. I say 'was' because it was torn down centuries ago. I do hope he's lying, because otherwise, he's mad."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Big thing. Always good smells coming out of it, too, like roasting meat and sunny days. I used to watch it, but I was never sure what it was for, you know? And the parents in the Downs never talked about it either."

He shrugs without looking at you. "Then one morning, I saw Corna - a friend of mine - and her mard go up. Mard gives her a kiss, sends her through. And Corna never came out again. Know what did, though?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Jherem sighs. "If you weren't in the Families in the Up, everywhere else was Downs, inside the wreckage. We'd dig deep, looking for food first, warm second. My neighborhood was inside this curvy spiral. If you've ever seen paintings of a seashell, it's like that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But no, it was a metal ring," he says, lowering his voice to a confidential whisper. "Didn't look to be worth much, but every once in a while, you'd hear Corna laughing. Wherever she was, she was *happy*, right?"

He raises his hand to his cheek, then continues. "Handful of days pass, and my mard takes me for a walk too. Said she'd find me when they'd saved the money, kissed me, and pushed me through it."

Jherem rubs his nose. "They're not so bad, but I keep hoping my parents will stop by to visit. Even if they don't have the money yet, right?"

He pauses, rubbing at the sudden moisture in his eyes. "I try to laugh a lot so they can hear me, though."
