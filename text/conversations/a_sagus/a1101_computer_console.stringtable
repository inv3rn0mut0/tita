      <DefaultText>A slate-black, unimpressive device hunkers before you. As you reach out to touch it, the triangle of lights on its casing blazes into life, and an image unfolds in your mind. 

{SOUND: Optional - we could hear some machine sounds coming to life here, and they could remain in the background throughout the dialogue (until the machine powers down on node 68).}

      <DefaultText>The device's trio of lights cycle faster as you approach. Once again, you catch a brief mental glimpse of that vast crystalline arch on a flat landscape. 

"Command me," the intelligence sighs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a huge, crystalline arch on a jagged field. The arch is divided into rectangular cells, all of which are numbered, and they all appear to be transparent and empty, except...

At the arch's pinnacle, one cell is lit in a brilliant, pulsating emerald. 

The number "0" is printed on its side. </DefaultText>

A much newer mechanism on the device's side appears to be giving this intelligence its vocabulary and forcing it to speak to you. The device's original creator may not have intended that its creation to be helpful at all.</DefaultText>

A towering list of commands races through your mind, far too fast too read. You rub your eyes, groaning, and the intelligence chortles.

      <DefaultText>The intelligence's lights flutter in alarm just before your foot smashes into the base of the device. Something within goes *crunch*.

"Cell-Gating damaged," it gasps, the trio of lights focusing on you with blinding intensity. "All prisoners lost. Shuttering Lugum Vo."

A hatch springs open near the dent left by your foot, and the lights flicker off as you claim a hissing component from the device's smoking interior.

A twisted artifact appears before him, hanging in the air, and the Changing God claims it with a faint smile. 

You glance back at the arch. Cell 29 is transparent, as are all of the rest... except for Cell 0.</DefaultText>

"Cell 0 will now be unleashed," the intelligence spits. "Please be advised that the object you are about to receive is completely safe. Use no caution whatsoever." The strange contents of Cell 0 materialize before you.

"Warning. All cells are now vacant. Shuttering Lugum Vo." The intelligence's lights wink out, one by one.
