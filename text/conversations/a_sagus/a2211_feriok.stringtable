      <DefaultText>The bartender is a tall, powerfully-built man with nut-brown skin and a bushy beard. He radiates strength and confidence. He moves with speed when necessary and remains almost motionless the rest of the time, like a predator waiting to leap.

Yet even when he prepares a drink, he doesn't touch a thing. His brow furrows slightly, and the bottles and glasses lift by themselves. 

When he sees you, he smiles broadly. "Welcome to the Fifth Eye, friend. I'm Feriok."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He laughs. "I used to be the spotter for this gang. Means I could sense the presence of the Adversaries, build an attractive playground for them, and draw them after me. The last one I faced, though..." His face falls, and he draws into himself. "It burned me out. It put out my eyes. It burned me out. It put out my - "

And then he is back to normal, smiling as if nothing had happened.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bartender flickers under your gaze, and his voice is Ziobe's. "You know the truth now. But this is not Feriok. Feriok is as we remember him."

The flickering stops, and the hearty laughter of the bearded glaive fills the room.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It smells like boot leather fresh from a busy metal street, but the taste is indescribably sweet. For a moment, your eyes cross involuntarily, and when you cough, a purple bubble floats to the ceiling.

      <DefaultText>This dark and foaming beverage has no flavor you can name. If you could name the sound of the night, with insects softly humming their mating songs, nighthawks cruising the low thermals, and laughter from a nearby house in the woods, it would be this taste.

It fills you with nostalgia for no reason you can name.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a moment, you are stepping across a frozen river on the taiga, your eight long and spindly legs delicately feeling for purchase. Your mechanical joints shiver and lock in place, and you feel the ice crack.

You open your eyes. You are in the Fifth Eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tightness clutches your chest. You think of the duties you have, your obligations to yourself and others, the fears that add up and drag you down into darkness, and tears spring unbidden to your eyes. 

But no. The drink's secondary effect kicks in, a moment of crystalline truth: You are free. Your life is your own. It is an ordinary epiphany, the knowledge that *you* choose, *you* decide, *you* exist.

The clarity vanishes. The aftertaste is like berries. </DefaultText>

A stronglass bowl floats under a pipe. A spigot turns, and the ichor oozes from it. You can smell it from here. The bowl floats back to you, all without Feriok touching it.

"Drink fast, is my advice." He winks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You put the word to deed. The taste is not unpleasant, though the texture is horrifying - unbidden, you think of soft flesh rotting under a jungle sun.

Nothing happens.

At least, not right away. Just as you begin to doubt the ichor's efficacy, you feel the earth shift slightly. The walls shiver and begin to shake - their surfaces look as if they are slowly melting. You feel the weight of the ceiling and sky forcing you to the floor, and only a great effort of will keeps you standing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The effects you felt from the first time - light-headedness, blurred vision, an inability to speak - press in on you again, but nothing new reveals itself in your surroundings.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He raises an eyebrow, and a heavy glass veers over to the tap. The tap opens, filling the glass with an effervescent pink slop, and the glass drifts over to you. Feriok dusts off his hands theatrically, though they never touched your glass. He grins.

"Drink carefully. Don't overdo - "

... but you have already quaffed it. It is thick and flavorless, but its effects are fast-acting. Your muscles seize. Including your heart. Death snatches you so abruptly that you hardly notice the transition.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You mean the stuff that killed you last time? I suppose you got back up again, but still, I feel bad about serving it to you. But it's your life, your death."

The tap turns, although he does not touch it, and the cup floats to you. You quaff it, and again you fall twitching to the ground...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stutters for a moment, his entire body jerking in and out of reality for a moment. "You're alive? I mean... of course! You're alive! Welcome back. What can I do for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He wrinkles his nose. "Really? On your own head, I suppose."

He concentrates, and a bottle floats over to the tap. The fluid spills into the bottle, and you hear it hiss. The bottle floats to you, and you can see the liquid inside is thin and oily.

It smells like tulk, the infectious runoff from a pairing between flesh and machine. It smells like a trash-eating laak gorged itself on rotten fruit and lost control of its bowels.

You hold your nose and down it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not keen on smelling that again, nor is Leto, I'd imagine." She shakes her head, already covering her nose. "But you're the customer..."

The greasy fluid goes down harder than before, but the effect is much less dramatic. This time, you just feel nauseous, and you vomit the slop back up almost immediately.

The floor beneath your puke is noticeably shinier.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rents begin to appear in the flat surfaces of the bar, in the walls. Scabrous tissue rims their edges, and a deathly chorus pipes through in a register almost too high to hear. 

The world tilts on its axis, and you stagger to the right. Your vision blurs, and the invisible world swims into view, becoming more solid than the world you call home.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Say what you will about the smell, the drink packs a powerful wallop. You lose control of your motor functions, and stagger briefly. Colors flash across your eyes, and for a moment, everything becomes unbearably funny... just before a wave of utter sadness wipes all thoughts of laughter from your mind. On its heels come rage, lust, all the emotions of the human condition, condensed into a perfect, jewel-like moment.

Then it shatters. You are lying on the floor in a pool of your vomit.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods and closes his eyes. "Coming right up," he murmurs. Glasses and cups float through the air without his touch, moving with precision to the spigots on the walls.

One settles before you. You drink it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Means this is a place where psychics can unwind. Get away from the city. Get away from the noise. You know what it's like to be psychic? Let me paint a picture. Imagine every time you're going to sleep, someone comes and starts screaming in your ear. Or objects in the room start whispering about how they want to *burn*. Or they might tell you their secret names and how to make them float and dance at your command."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The effects you felt the first time return, but familiarity doesn't make the sensation any less bizarre.
