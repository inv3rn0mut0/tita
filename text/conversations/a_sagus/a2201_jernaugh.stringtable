"The drones fill your blood with millions of tiny machines that promptly begin devouring you alive until they learn to differentiate between your body and anything that's *not* supposed to be in there.

      <DefaultText>"It's quite safe," he says, nodding. "Most of the time. In almost three out of five cases. And the procedure couldn't be simpler. The drones simply saw your skull open, shove an implant into the right spot and seal everything back up again."

He clasps his hands. "Once they do that, the implant will help you identify the purposes of unknown numenera. It costs [Global: a2201_JernaughNumeneraAnalyzerPrice] shins, but it pays for itself!"

      <DefaultText>A drone streaks past, dropping a fine, flexible mesh over your forearm. The resulting sizzle, you realize, is your flesh melting. You're not quite sure what the popping sensations in your elbow are, but you're too busy screaming to figure it out.

Then, you feel the first bite. 

The machines swarm through you like a metal wave, nipping and tearing, devouring flesh, muscle, and organs. You open your mouth to scream, and they pour out in a gleaming flood.
