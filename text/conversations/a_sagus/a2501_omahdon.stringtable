      <DefaultText>This robed man turns a golden-bespectacled gaze and winning smile on you. He seems a charming-enough sort, but it's clear he wants something from you and is perfectly willing to take it - politely and with absolute guile, of course.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As I said, she is hauntingly beautiful, with purple hair that floats around her head on winged combs. Her speech may seem confused, so pay no mind to what she says. It is only her madness talking. Once she is returned to me, I will be able to cure her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes! That is one of her combs! Incredible!"

He takes it from you with great care. "I knew that witch was lying to me! She told me that Perseia had never stayed with her. Please, go to Tranquility and ask her where Perseia went. Maybe she'll tell *you* the truth!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a long moment, Omahdon looks like he's about to punch you, but then he turns away. "You're right. My Perseia was the one who slept. The one who woke was a stranger to me, and I have tortured both her and myself by trying to force her reality to match my fantasy. I have been a fool, and worse, a villain. She... she will not see me again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He snarls. "She only hates me because she doesn't know me. If she would just stand still, I would show her who I am, and then she couldn't help but love me! I *will* show her! Just as soon as I find her."</DefaultText>

He chuckles. "And since I now know she is going to neither place, and that the only other ship to have flown from Sagus Cliffs since I arrived was heading to the Valley of Dead Heroes, the two of you have actually pointed me in the right direction. I will find Perseia again where I found her at the beginning, and we will start again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His face reddens with rage. "Did Tranquility tell you this? Well, she lies! Perseia was not dead. She was... made inanimate by ancient technologies. I merely used other technologies to awaken her from a long slumber."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The distinction is more subtle than you might think. Some of the prior Worlds made no such distinction at all," he waves a hand, "but that isn't important. What *is* important is that we love each other, and I must get her back."</DefaultText>

He bares his teeth. "I doubt she'll say anything different if I ask her again. Please, will you speak to her? Confront her with the proof you've found, and perhaps she'll tell you where Perseia went."</DefaultText>

He takes it from you with great care. His eyes soften as he looks upon it, and he seems unable to pull them away. "It's more proof that Tranquility lied to me.
