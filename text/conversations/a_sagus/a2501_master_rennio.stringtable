      <DefaultText>This airship's master is keeping a close eye on his vessel. He is a short and wiry man, dressed in travel-stained but well-kept clothing. He is chewing on his impeccably groomed mustache in frustration. His fingers are in constant motion, as if he wanted to take part in the work he's supervising. 

As you approach, he turns away from his vessel. "Welcome to Master Rennio's Aerophile Adventures. How may I be of assistance?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> His price for the airship journey is sizable (enough that the player may need to accumulate more shins if he hasn't completed any side content).

      <DefaultText>If the player failed the Stay of Execution quest (Ris was executed) but met Tybir in the Caravanserai and agreed that Tybir would join the party when they left town, then Tybir should approach the party at the end of this dialogue, right before they transition to the Valley of Dead Heroes. He'll ask if the player wants him to come along, and if the player says yes, he'll be a party member when the player arrives in the Valley.

      <DefaultText>He bows slightly. "I regret that my vessel is currently not air-worthy. The expansion of the Endless Battle has had the unfortunate side effect of damaging civilian vessels. Perhaps when our repairs are complete I'll have a different answer."
{GAVIN: George says: Basically, the player is allowed to ask if he can fly somewhere before he has the quest to go to the Valley, and Rennio is like, "Oh, sorry, my airship is under repair."  Then when the player has the quest, conveniently, the airship is ready to go.
I'd rather get rid of that entirely - the player can't even ask to fly anywhere until he actually has an objective to leave the city.}</DefaultText>
