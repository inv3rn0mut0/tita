      <DefaultText>A man in a brigandine coat stands in front of the heavy wooden gate. His arms are crossed, his feet firmly planted. 

"You got business with the Memovira?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you ever set foot in the Bloom, you'd know why. It's like... living inside the mouth of a jiraskar, and it can chew you up any time it likes. But it waits... toys with you, watches while you drive yourself crazy, waiting for its teeth to close around you..." He catches himself, lowers his voice. "The Bloom gets everybody in the end. It gets in your head... eats you from the inside out." 

Behind his spiky helm, you notice that the man's eyes are sunken and dark.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She's the boss lady of the Bloom. Been in charge for about ten years. Couldn't tell you what the title means, but there's always been a Memovira."

His eyes narrow. "And if you had to ask that question, you ain't got business with her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Born in Cliff's Edge. House where I grew up fell into the sea a couple years back, thanks to the sticha... may the Black Three bugger 'em with flaming pricks." He spits. 

"Joined up with the Memovira and served five years in the Bloom. Gets in your head, the Bloom does. Whispers to you... tells you to do things, maybe." His eyes gleam. "When the boss lady found out, she sent me out here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nobody crosses her. Not even the Council." He waves a dismissive hand at the passers-by. "All these poor plodders are scared of her, an' that means they're scared of me, too. 'Go work for the Memovira, son,' that's what my dad told me. 'Ye'll never be anybody in this life if folk ain't scared of you'."</DefaultText>

Truth is, if she *did* pass through here, she probably stopped at the inn. So if you want to find Miss Purple Hair, that's where I'd start."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Out of the corner of her mouth, she mutters quietly to you, "The Memovira *he* serves is hardly worth the water it takes to spit - a real shin-shaving grifter. The old one was the living avatar of the Bloom."</DefaultText>
