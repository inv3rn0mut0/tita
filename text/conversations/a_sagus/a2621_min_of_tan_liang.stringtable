      <DefaultText>This priest is tall, thin, and dressed only in black. Narrow slashes of oil decorate his unlined skin like letters in an unknown tongue. His eyes are harried, but alive with intelligent humor. 

They land on you with a tiny flicker of recognition.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Heh," he says, shaking his head. "That's a big question, even on the best days. I specialize in mechanical numenera, intelligent or not, but I haven't had much time for research since I started managing our branch of the Order."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was founded three hundred years ago by a varjellen nano named Diviaticu - that's his statue outside. He governed, or you could say *ruled*, the Order with more force than you see in traditional chapters. He set us up in this spire, hand-picked new members, and chose them for particular projects of his design."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We're... not quite that organized these days," he says, shrugging. "For better or worse. Leaders are chosen by consent of the other priests and priestesses, and they don't have a say in what everyone works on. They just deal with the politics and the paperwork so that everyone else can focus on their ruinous side projects and hideously dangerous experiments."

He flashes a grin. "Which is to say, I'm the leader because I'm the only one who admits we need to eat."  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Funny thing," he says. "An Aeon Priest can work for twelve hours and forget the pastry on the plate next to them until ants carry it away. But if we can't buy food, everyone gets an appetite at once."

"It's possible," he says at last. "Diviaticu's behavior matches the stories I've heard about the Changing God. But he hasn't exactly shown up here to pick up where he left off." He shrugs. "If you're right, maybe he just lost interest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hmm." He handles the shard with care. "Organic *and* crystalline. It was grown into the appropriate shape for the machine. This is definitely what Salimeri was working on all those years ago. With her partner." He looks at you, his eyebrow raised, but does not say more.

"We live on the surface of a vast labyrinth of layered ruins, packed with relics and artifacts. Windows into the past. Some people are content to find them, use them, and sell them."

He grins. "But not the Order of Truth. Not the Aeon Priests. We want to understand the numenera. Study them. Point at them and argue about them."</DefaultText>

"There's Salimeri, who I mentioned before. Beleazar studies biomechanical lifeforms. Orth Faung is an expert in inexplicable and malicious architecture and should be back soon." He pauses, ticking his fingers and furrowing his brow. </DefaultText>

Min sweeps a hand through his dark hair. "Like it or not - and I *know* you don't - the Slave Families demand cooperation for their shins. If we don't maintain the levy network - if we don't play their games - that funding goes away. And so does the Order of Truth."</DefaultText>

"Maybe," he says, rubbing his forehead, smearing the grease stains there. "You know, I used to have time for my own work. It wasn't always..." he waves his hands vaguely, "politics and dinners and polite 'requests'. "
