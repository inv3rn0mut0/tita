      <DefaultText>"I trusted you!" he shouts. Frustrated tears shimmer at the corners of his eyes, refusing to fall. El-Jinto steps back to a discreet distance, an expression of sadness crossing his face. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You think you've *won*?" he hisses. One tear escapes and streaks down his bony cheek. "You think this is the first time I've ever been betrayed?"

Panting with rage, he jams a finger in your face. "I'm going to tell the Order of Truth that you've betrayed an Aeon Priest on a... on a secret mission! Everyone is going to know you can't be trusted!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hold out the notes, and Beleazar snatches them from your hands. As his eyes widen, you explain how you got them.  

"This is more than I expected to learn on my own," Beleazar whispers, flushing. "All that time spent on *subterfuge*, and I could have just asked? Thank you. Thank you for everything. Thank you!" he shouts at El-Jinto. The seasoned explorer cringes and gives him a little wave. 

Beleazar hands you your reward, then wanders away, flipping through the pages. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ignoring the gasp from El-Jinto's direction, you rip the papers into shreds and toss them in Beleazar's face. Confused, he plucks one from the air, reads it, and his face goes white. 

"What kind of man are you?" he whispers. "You destroyed a detailed study of the nychthemeron just because I *shouted* at you?" With one last, hateful glare, he whirls on his heels and storms off. </DefaultText>
