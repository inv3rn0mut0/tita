      <DefaultText>This scrawny old man practically rattles inside dull and dented armor that was clearly made for someone bigger than him. Nonetheless, his eyes burn with a bottomless fire, and his smile - as fierce as it is genuine - flashes beneath his graying thicket of a beard.</DefaultText>

{COLIN/GEORGE: Should there be conditions on this node so it only appears if Quijano can be sent on at least one of the possible adventures? Leaving alone for now as that might be a snarl of conditionals, and his initial warning might justify the lack of options that follows.}</DefaultText>

He straightens. "I am not interested in entangling myself in local quarrels. I will not hunt a beast that cannot hunt me in return! And if I am to fight, it must be against a foe of such wickedness that the stars themselves would wink out rather than shine upon a world that could harbor such malevolent creatures!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes?" he says, looking disappointed. "What sort of beast is that, then? It sounds like a fish."

He misjudges your expression and raises his gauntlets. "Fish *can* be fearsome foes. I am not belittling your quest! But one must only step from the water, you see, and the creature is rendered harmless!" 

He frowns. "Except the venom-spitting Spinelords of Gamut-Har, of course. Except those."</DefaultText>

"I swam into those twisted temples, chasing the heart-rending cries of a lost soul. Those foul-breathed creatures hounded my every stroke, spitting their clouds of poisoned needles into my back. At last, I succumbed." He hangs his head. 

"When I awoke, I was floating face-down in a pond. Gamut-Har had vanished, along with its guardians!"</DefaultText>

"I misjudged you," he says. "This beast does indeed sound worthy of a grand adventure! I will hasten to the Reef now and observe our quarry from a distance. I'll see you there, my friend."

      <DefaultText>"Your floating fish-beast did not disappoint!" he says. His cheeks are still aglow with exertion. "We faced it with nothing more than courage and the promise of glory. And we prevailed!"

He sighs, misting up a little. "At any rate. What brings you back to the summit of Mount Ithiador?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tears well in Quijano's eyes, and he fishes a monogrammed handkerchief from the depths of one of his bracers.

"Such a noble company!" he says hoarsely, dabbing his cheeks. "Such a noble goal! Were I not committed to my own path, I would seek to join yours!"

He sighs heavily. "But I will not. Instead... might I seek your blessing?"

"May your glory always find you. May your burdens only strengthen you and each of your scars tell a better story than the last.  And when your enemies are too many, and your wounds too severe, may you fall with a smile on your face and peace in your faltering heart."

He smashes his gauntlet against his chest, leaving a sizable dent. "I can't recall, and it doesn't matter! For then, I heard a thunderous roar and beheld a great beast in the skies! I donned my armor and gave chase!" </DefaultText>

He lays a gentle hand on your shoulder, turning you to the horizon. "Do not allow delirium to blind you to your accomplishments, good knight. You have scaled the very heights of Mount Ithiador, the Tooth of the World Beast. Adventure lies in every shadow below us. Every sparkle of light is a quest, ready for the taking!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes," he says, nodding proudly. "It *has* seen some use. My ancestor forged it in the fires of Silvercloud Mountain for her battle against the Xiriquand Hordes. This was the wound that killed her!" He taps a much-mended spot on the chestplate.
