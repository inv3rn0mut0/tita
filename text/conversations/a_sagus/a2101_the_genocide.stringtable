      <DefaultText>This burly, armor-clad figure stands almost motionless as you approach. He regards you silently through his singular eye. The studs on his arms and the blades on his shoulders are stained and pitted with age. 

When he speaks, his voice is muffled and artificial, a hollow grumble that emanates from the entirety of the helmet.

"I am the Genocide. If you ask, I must answer. Pass on, then, and exchange no words."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We drove them to the Forge of the Night Sky, to the valley of M'ra Jolios, to the dangers of the Black Riage. But those who built atop these ruins... they thwarted us. Time and again. And so we brought our constructs and our deadliest warriors to the bay outside the city. We laid a mighty siege."

"We entered the human settlement. We fought past barricades and traps. Some of our constructs are still here, silent and dead. But when we thought we had achieved our greatest victory..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The nearby panels buzz and crackle with unseen energies. "The shields," you mutter. "We need the shields *now*."

You press several buttons. A generator coughs into life, and the lights flicker for a moment. A faint veil of energy encircles the city, and then there is a strange and terrible stillness, as if the world held its breath.

The rest of the memory is bloodshed. The humans of Sagus Cliffs made the stranded Tabaht pay.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>... and then the memory fades. 

You know now that the nano who saved the city became the Changing God. You know it was he who defeated the Tabaht. You *remember* the hatred.

... but you do not remember the girl who was with you. What was her name?

The Genocide watches you silently.</DefaultText>

He will never give out any Jagged Dream quests, but a respected leader of the cell will be mentioned by other members, and the player has a few ways finding out who it is. </DefaultText>

He shifts his weight. You hear the frown in his voice. "I was Ogesti tel Kotu, the Firm Hand of Tradition. They called me one of the Black Three. Enemies did not understand us. They took my name to mean death in a dozen extinct tongues, called me Orphan-maker, Hopesmasher, Death's Child. My armies blackened the earth and the skies. My dragoliths scoured the land. Domination was my duty."

      <DefaultText>From within the helmet, you hear a grinding noise, the sound of teeth gnashing, amplified. Then, the voice again, bleak: "We sat at the river's edge and we wept for the time that was. We saw nothing more to conquer, and yet our fears still drove us. We had conquered the land, purged its impurities, made it ours. Still we wanted more. When we heard that humans had come to carve a home, we rejoiced to have a new foe, a new test of our truth. We rode against them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Genocide raises his hands in defeat. "He found old knowledge and made it his own. He created defenses that we could not penetrate.

We were pure, incorruptible, indivisible even in disunity. We found strength in one another, and proved it with bloody blades. But we fell. And the Underspine fell.

He shifts slightly. "The generators are unused, abandoned, their purpose forgotten. Though the people of this city still swear by our name, and our terrors are fresh in their nightmares despite the passage of centuries, they have forgotten the means of their salvation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He lowers his head. "A powerful nano saved them. With his magics, he called upon the strength of the ancients and captured us. I thought my life was at an end. But he imprisoned me in slow time, trapped me in my body, used machines to paralyze my will. I still remember our glories, and I see the faded future in front of me, and I am powerless to act.

      <DefaultText>He pauses. "The Underspine was our soul, our confessor. We knew clean, hard rapture from it. We knew our path. It gave us the words of the ancient Tabaht, and our path was rigid and unbending. Absolute."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He considers. "You would not understand. It was a machine. It was a stone. It was a cavern. It was a city. It was the direct voice of our ancestors. It spoke in our heads, and in our ears, and in our hearts. We heard its voice in our creches, in our daily instructions. Our god was true and strong and singular, not the fickle, inconstant things of the modern day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We had no questions about our duty, about our goals - only the particulars. We erased doubts in the purity of utter certainty. Questions raised are questions answered, or they are heresy. No need for self-agony. The necessity of introspection was transmuted into optimization of our paths, into fashioning ourselves into the pinnacle of our achievement. Clear definition in life creates truth. Not this pitiful shadow."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You can hear the frown in his voice. "Sabotage. Or failure. One of those under my command told me that it had whispered *defeat* into his ears, as if it had sickened, lost sight of the true path. Given the question, the Underspine denied this. My soldier was cast out, and I suffered the barb for his doubt. It was later, years later, that the Underspine broke. After our failure. And I have never been sure if the seeds for our defeat were planted in those days."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then I am truly the last. He spoke of casting a shadow in death, of creating a structure that would outlive him. I did not understand his explanation. It was not my duty.

He looks down, and flexes his hands. Then, quieter: "No. I do believe you. The world is in decline. Nothing approaches the perfection we established. At least He Who Shares has shared his insights with the world again. Perhaps he can resurrect the Underspine."</DefaultText>

He gestures. "All this. It was to have been mine in stewardship for the future of my people. It was promised. But now." His arm falls back to its side.

"Now I am the Genocide. A relict. The last of my kind."

Punishment was purification. This, though, is torture. The worst of the city's refuse can mock me now. They can ridicule and jape, and I am powerless to strike them for their impudence."
