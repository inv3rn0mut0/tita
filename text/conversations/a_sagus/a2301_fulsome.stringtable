      <DefaultText>This man towers over you, enormously fat and draped in gaudy robes. His expression is calm - stern, even - as he regards the bloody mess spread across the floor and wall.

The hooded figures on either side of him tense as you approach. He turns to inspect you, eyebrow lifted, and raises his hand. His bodyguards relax, watching you.

In the space of a second, his eyes flick over you. He nods, apparently to himself, as if your presence has confirmed something he expected.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His gaze shifts to Matkina, and his expression hardens further.

"Matkina. You will tell me if you know anything about the murder of Wheedle," he says, gesturing at the bloody floor with a ringed hand. "And if you are responsible, you will reveal the name of your employer. Now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There is an assassin named Matkina," he says. "She is known as the White Death. I have helped her find work in the past, but she has become... erratic. If she is not involved, she might know who is. If you wish to help in this matter, ask her what she knows. The creature named Mapper may know where she is."

      <DefaultText>He beckons at you, a hard, sharp motion, his jaw set, his teeth partly bared. 

"Someone else was murdered in your absence," he says. "A woman called 'Crooked Qeek' was killed beside the water."

He turns his face from you. "I ask that you share any new information that you have. And if you do not have any, *find some*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His hands are shaking fists at his side, as if he wants to strike someone but has no target. 

"Another murder has occurred," he says. "Manth Pa was a wandering jack, and of occasional use to me. Now he is dead."

He bares a crescent of gritted teeth at you. "Work harder, godling. My people are dying."</DefaultText>

"We killed the wrong cultist," Fulsome growls. "It was Kiyatawa after all. She killed a woman named Mechela and fled the city. If you ever see her again, feel *free* to do the same thing to her that she did to my people."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns his back on you, staring down at the vast pool of blood.

"This is all that remains of Wheedle, one of my proteges. I had hopes for him. Now, they will never be realized. The Underbelly is poorer without him." The rage beneath his voice cuts each word shorter and shorter.

"Bring me any information you find. Help me discover the identity of his killer, and you will be rewarded."

"Qeek is harmless. She should *have* no enemies." He exhales softly, and meets your eyes. "I would like you to continue this line of investigation. Speak with Imbitu and his acolytes. Discover which one of them threatened little Qeek."</DefaultText>

He shakes his head slowly, tendons leaping in his neck. "But Qeek's death has only robbed the Underbelly of her smile. I cannot imagine why she was a target."</DefaultText>
