      <DefaultText>As you step onto what looks like the back of the enormous construct, four strangers approach you.

In the lead is a wiry man with parallel scars running from cheek to collarbone on the left side of his face. He gives you a welcoming smile, pulling on gray gloves embedded with pulsing lights.

He's about to say something to you when he notices Callistege.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My name is Qorro," he says, then raises a gloved hand. "No, don't bother introducing yourself. We won't be acquainted for long, one way or the other, and I'm so very bad with names, faces, and people in general." 

His hand falls back to his side, curling casually into a fist. "At any rate. Have you have seen a falling star that landed near here, not long ago?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nothing's wrong, dear. I accompanied Qorro on an expedition once, long ago. His methods were too... crass for my tastes. Though in his defense, he never tried to kill *me* when my back was turned." She beams at Qorro. "Or if he did, he failed, and I didn't notice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Qorro gives you a long, hard look. Then, he sighs. 

"An admirable goal. Were I less enamored of-" He coughs, blushing, then continues. "Of certain pursuits, and in dire need of money, I would likely be doing the same. Good hunting. Perhaps we'll meet again."</DefaultText>

"The world is littered with ruins and fascinating secrets. Trouble is, *anyone* can claim them. But when something falls from the sky? Ah, that's rarer, and a man can make his name off such a find."

He pauses, then adds, "We're also being paid quite handsomely. That helps."</DefaultText>

{SCRIPT: This check maxes out at Very Hard, but the following modifiers can apply: 1. a1201_QorroPreCrisis=1 makes the DT slightly easier. 2. a1201_QorroPreCrisis=2 negates the above bonus, making the DT Very Hard again. 3. Each increment of the a1201_PCirritatedQorro variable makes the DT slightly harder.}</DefaultText>
