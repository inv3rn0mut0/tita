      <DefaultText>A jumble of boulders and debris lies at the foot of the surrounding cliffside. The broken remains of ancient devices lie amongst the fallen stone, while off to one side, a metallic canister sticks out of the top of the pile. 

It appears mostly intact. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It takes some doing, but you manage to chip away at the side of one of the boulders enough to allow you to wrench free one of the devices embedded in it.

      <DefaultText>Just as the device you are picking at comes free, you hear a small pop and see a small wisp of smoke rise from it. Moments later, a series of small pops erupt from the pile, and numerous ribbons of smoke waft toward the sky. Picking up one rock after another, you discover that all of the remaining devices have burnt themselves out.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It takes a few soundings of the beeping for you to home in on its origin. Once you're sure you've found the right spot, a fair number of stones need to be moved before you finally discover the source of the noise: a small device that appears battered but functional. As you pick it up, it beeps twice as if to recognize its acquisition, then lapses into a contented silence.

      <DefaultText>The smoke from your previous handling of the rocks has dissipated, and the rocks stand still and quiet.

Other than the occasional beep that sounds from somewhere deep within the pile, that is.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Leaning over, you notice that the container is hollow, with an opening in the top providing full access to the interior. A quick glance reveals that it is empty. While most of the canister is relatively intact, a small part of its exterior wall has been pried open, exposing delicate mechanisms.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You notice a slight gleam as the light hits some of the rocks at just the right angle. 

You lean closer. Tiny mechanical devices are embedded in the rock. A quick search of the rest of the pile reveals that only a small percentage of the rocks are more than they appear.</DefaultText>

When you can see again, the stones have all been pulverized to fine dust.</DefaultText>
