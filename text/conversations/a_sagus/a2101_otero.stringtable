      <DefaultText>Wind spins off the distant sea, sweeping between you and the boy, whistling up toward the peaks of Sagus Cliffs.

He glances at you, then at the crowds in the plaza beyond. He appears to be looking for someone. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He flinches, though you don't see why. It wasn't as if you shouted.

"Sorry," he says at last. "You reminded me of someone I know, the way you said that. And I wasn't being *rude*. You just don't look happy. Or rich. It's what you'd call a 'guess'."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But despite his hard words, his eyes settle on yours. Studying. Deciding. His mouth settles into an irritated line.  

"Look," he says, running a hand over his stubbled scalp. "You hide it well, but I can tell you're new here. I ent trying to offend you, but I... don't like leaving folk new to Sagus on their own. If you have questions about the city - or Circus Minor in particular - I'll answer 'em, free of charge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yeah. The heart of the city," he says, folding his arms. "The levies and politicians'll tell you that Government Square is the center of Sagus Cliffs, but they're not thinking right."

He spreads his hands, framing the plaza. "When folk come to Sagus, they come here. They talk and trade. Flirt and fight. Tell stories. Everyone who comes here leaves different." 

His hands fall. "Anyway. What do you want to know?"</DefaultText>
