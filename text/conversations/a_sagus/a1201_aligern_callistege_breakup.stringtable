      <DefaultText>"Surprisingly, I agree with Callistege." He turns away from her, as if edging her from the conversation. "Look: you have an important decision to make." His voice drops to a whisper, and he shoots a glance at Callistege. "I don't trust her to shepherd you to where you want to go. Not safely. Come with me. Leave her behind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not so fast. You know what they'll do to you there? I wasn't joking before when I said they'd cut you open. Their devotion is to themselves, and if they find your answer they'll hold it over your head to make you their lackey. I can't let you do that." His voice drops to a whisper, and he shoots a glance at Callistege. "And I don't trust her to shepherd you there safely. Come with me. Leave her behind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't be a fool! What kind of wisdom do you suppose a group of wild-eyed fanatics and know-nothings can muster? If you need validation and worship, then yes, by all means go to the cult. But if you need answers, you'll come to the Order with me." Her echoes stare at you grimly, united for once. "Aligern is leading you astray. I won't see that happen."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>He nods. "Yes. These are two very different paths, and you need to pick them carefully. I offer you the knowledge of people who have studied the Changing God for decades. She offers generalists and theoreticians."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aligern misstates the facts, as usual. I would expose you to a broad base on which to build your answers, minds accustomed to scientific rigor, and careful analysis. He would give you wild-eyed fanatics whose sole qualification is deranged worship."</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her echoes exchange glances with each other. She holds her tongue for a second, and then thinks better of it. "We can *all* hear you, Aligern. That lack of trust cuts both ways. You suggest a foolhardy path for our friend here, and you'll betray him if it suits your purpose. Leave him and his fears here, child. I'll see your resonance chamber put right." She seems possessive, almost predatory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shoots her a dirty look. "Speaking of betrayal, you've seen how quick she is to sell her companions for profit. She knew that bounty hunter. Suspicious that he'd be here at just this time, eh?"

His words now are clearly intended for his erstwhile colleague. "I may have my doubts about you, castoff, but I won't sell you for my own gain. She will. She'll slither round you and charm you with her lore, but it'll never be for your good, no matter what she tells you. It's me or her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And I don't really care if you want to visit the Order of Truth. I've coddled Aligern's pain-raddled, judgmental weakness for far too long. That ends today. I've had enough. Choose one of us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"On the other hand, if you'd prefer *civilized* company, you can find me at the Order of Truth. I will be happy to aid your quest. {pause, stern voice}But do not come with Aligern in tow. I will not suffer him again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Finally, something we agree on," he growls. "Kid, she'll chop off your head and spit down your throat. I'll get you where you need to go, and let you sleep at night to boot. It's up to you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyebrows draw together. "Aligern, had I meant to betray you, my plot would have been deeper - and more successful - than trusting your demise to someone like Qorro. When I turn on you, the last thing you'll see is my laughing face."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She bursts out laughing. "My dear boy, we have *been* working it out. Aligern's petulance, his *obstinacy* in the face of fact, drive me away every day. He might be strong, but he's also *thick*. I dare you to try traveling with him, and see how long you endure. Not as long as I have, I'll wager."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His face darkens under her accusations, but he manages a pained smile. "As if you're doing me a favor by staying with me? Do you think I don't see your true self in all those echoes around you? That's *you*, Callistege, every facet of it. Your vivisectionist's heart hasn't changed, just the way you present it.

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Don't be absurd. Even if I had I any interest in betraying you, do you really think that I would need Qorro's help? I would simply do the job myself. Why dilute potential profits by introducing a cut-rate mercenary to the equation?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So you admit that you plan to profit off him?" He gestures at Callistege with his tattoo-covered arm. "I told you she's not to be trusted. You haven't seen one tenth of her depths, not one twentieth. She's a back-stabbing bitch, and this mess here only proves it."</DefaultText>
