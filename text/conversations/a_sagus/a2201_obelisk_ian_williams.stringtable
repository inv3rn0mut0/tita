      <DefaultText>These three triangles float serenely above a scuffed stone basin. You can't help noticing that the citizens of Sagus are giving this monument a wide berth. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The three triangles hang motionless and silent in the air.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The largest triangle shines brightly, radiating a soothing warmth. The middle, darker one hovers above it, turned slightly away from the first with what strikes you as disdain. The third is small, dryly amused, and so deeply indigo as to be nearly black. It's removed from the first two triangles.

You hesitate. You were sensing emotions from these objects. Intent. Something is strange here. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out and time slows. Your hand drifts past individual motes of light-dappled dust, moving into the warm glow of the large triangle. 

Calm warmth bleeds up your arm when you grasp the edge of the triangle. It's somehow rigid and flexible at the same time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You blink, swaying. In the half-second before you open your eyes, you hear the thunderous crack of wood on wood and the rumble of distant voices. 

You snatch your hand from the triangle. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Staring at this triangle is... disorienting. The longer you stare at it, the more you feel a tight coiling sensation in your own head. 

Standing on your toes and stretching, you manage to brush the triangle's icy face with your finger. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The air thickens like a weight over you, and you struggle to keep your eyes open. Between the thumping of your heartbeat, you hear thousands of purposeful, rhythmic footsteps treading endless stairs toward the peak of a vast, echoing room.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You blink, and...

A strip of light unwinds ahead of you like a path through infinite, murmuring dark. Behind you is an ever-shifting zoetrope of linked, motionless *yous*. It is your past, you realize. Every second of it, every choice pouring out of you and trailing away into the black.

You open your eyes. You're back at the stone ring, still touching the triangle. All three of them are watching you. You blink again...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The strip of light. The surrounding darkness. And in the valley between the slow pulsing of your heart, you hear the murmurs of countless witnesses. The raised voices of your past and future companions. The heated condemnations of enemies you haven't met yet. And above it all...

A trio of voices. One warm, one cold, and one dryly practical. They are speaking a verdict, but you can't hear them over the din. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You bellow into the dark, clenching your fists, and the crowd instantly falls silent. So do the judges.

In the echoing silence that follows you realize that you are alone. You always were.

You stride on. </DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>You stride on. Some of the innumerable witnesses cheer. Others angrily denounce you. 

It doesn't matter. Their voices fade into the darkness behind you, leaving you alone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Exhaling sharply, you clap your hands over your ears, forcing your mind through the gap between the voices. 

You open your eyes. The three triangles hang in the air exactly as they did before, unmoving and silent. The vision is gone. And yet, you can still feel the choices you've made, curving away behind you like a string of jewels. 

You straighten, moving into the future breath by breath. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You suddenly notice a message, carved into the stone ring beneath the triangles. 

"Judge yourself."

As you watch, it slowly fades away. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You follow the road. Casually, you look to the right, and the path at your feet flickers, as if anticipating your new direction. Clearly, your choices define this road's course and not the other way around.

      <DefaultText>The stone is cracked in places, but far newer than the ancient shapes that float above. You suspect that the citizens of Sagus added the basin to make the triangles look less out of place. </DefaultText>
