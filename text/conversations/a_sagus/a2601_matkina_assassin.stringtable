      <DefaultText>[If the player tried to warn Jebedee, but the old man didn't believe the player, confronted Matkina, and got himself killed, Matkina will probably be a little smug when she walks over to the player. She knows what the player tried to do, but she'll meet him at the Cave anyway. However, this counts as Minor Abuse of Matkina.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[If the player warned Jebedee and he actually got away, Matkina will walk over and confront the player angrily. She needed that money! The player can try to soften her anger (a DT, much easier if Riastrad and Satsada are there to help). If successful, it's only a Minor Abuse. Otherwise it's Major. Either way, she grudgingly agrees to meet the player at the Cave.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She eyes you appraisingly, though her eyes have begun to lose focus. With her target dead, she has begun to retreat to some inward world, as if searching for some half-forgotten truth. "I can't believe that worked. For one of our kind, you're not entirely worthless."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[She also tells the player how to open the Engraved Panel (if Satsada isn't here), then exits and despawns.

Alternatively, she could launch into her full intro dialogue right here, if that makes sense (including the opportunity for the player to enter Tash's Mere).]</DefaultText>

Her face is still and cold. "Don't forget, sweet sibling. You *owe* me."
