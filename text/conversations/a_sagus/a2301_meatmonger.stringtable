      <DefaultText>A short, solid man stands behind a smoking grill, turning pieces of meat with a pair of grimy tongs. Sweat is pouring down his grizzled face, yet he's covered head to toe in grease-spattered clothes. His sleeves are tight at the wrists and his collar pinches his neck. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Meuk nods, saunters over to the vat of red, throbbing muscles, and carves off a slice. He spears the meat with a sharpened bone skewer and slaps it onto his grill, sprinkling it with a flurry of spices. When the meat is cooked, he hands you the skewer, and you take a bite. 

The meat is gamy and a little tough, but the spices are so intense that you hardly notice. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good choice!" Meuk produces a jagged knife and saws one of the leathery wings from the fluttering mass and tosses it onto his grill. It flaps weakly for a few moments, then lies still. An aroma like sweet, baking fruit begins to rise from stiffening wing. After a short time, Meuk lifts it from the grill with a pair of tongs and hands it to you.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs, giving you a dubious look. With a quick motion of his hand, Meuk tears two wriggling laak tails from the vat, twists them together, and ties them into a loop. Then he drops them on the grill, where they begin to sizzle and spit. As they cook, the green and white color grows brighter and more intense. 

After a short while, Meuk takes them from the grill and hands them to you.</DefaultText>

He waves the tongs around to show you what he means. "So one day, I was fiddling with this thing while cutting up a carcass, and it kept growing back its missing parts.

      <DefaultText>Nearby are three large vats that are filled with living meat, great amorphous masses of it, with appendages growing from them like the limbs of animals drowning in a meat swamp. The first vat is filled with thick, throbbing muscles, red and raw. The second is a flapping monstrosity of leathery wings, and the third sprouts hundreds of laak tails, all wiggling obscenely.

The cook looks up from his work and gives you a sweaty smile. "Hey ho! I'm Meuk the Meatmonger. What'll you have?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He pulls a device from one of his pockets. It looks like a segment of synth pipe, but it's covered in soft, fine hair, and it has a wide nozzle on one end. The other end appears to be broken, as if the device was once part of something larger. 

Meuk points the nozzle at your mellidrym seed and starts flicking his fingers against the side of the device - flipping hidden switches, perhaps. Your ears pop very softly but otherwise you don't see or hear anything - until the seed begins to grow...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take a bite. The wing is crunchy and sweet, with a rich and fruity taste.

      <DefaultText>Somehow, the tails are still wriggling as you take a tentative bite. The meat is flaky, overly sweet, and it fizzes in your mouth like bubbly water.

      <DefaultText>You take another bite of the aneen meat, trying to get a sense of the flavor that lies beneath the heavy spice. Its taste summons a welter of memories. You've eaten aneen flesh before, perhaps many times. It evokes a vague sense of desperation, of a vast, ruined landscape, detonations erupting around you... scavenging the bodies of fallen beasts for food. You realize that it isn't one memory but many... many lifetimes, perhaps, in a hellscape of war.

The memories fade...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The front of the seed bulges into a droopy gray head, and several protuberances expand to form little trunks with mouths on the ends. The back of the seed swells into a lumpy little body with fat, useless legs. Sad little eyes bud from the side of the head and open, gazing resignedly at you and Meuk. Sure enough, the creature looks almost exactly like the one the beggar had.</DefaultText>
