      <DefaultText>This tall, stately woman studies the air with the intense focus of an artisan. She senses your approach and faces you.

Concentration turns to surprise... then awe-tinged anger.

      <DefaultText>You float beneath a nauseous tide of darkness. Indistinct sounds drift by you like shining fish. Slowly, you rise towards consciousness and the sounds string themselves together into words. A woman's voice, arch and scornful. 

"Have you *any* idea who this is? Who you've hauled through the streets like a sack of grain? Qorro, look at the tattoo, for pity's sake. Does it mean nothing to you?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>4</ID>
      <DefaultText>You recognize one of the parties in this one-sided argument - Qorro, the star-seeker you met in the Reef. He studies his boots, silent and miserable. 

The other is a tall woman in finely-cut robes, regarding the man with arch disdain. 

"When I told you to retrieve the falling star, I wonder if you heard 'return to me with empty hands and excuses'." She sighs. 

"I no longer need your services, Qorro. Collect your things and go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And that is why you are unsuited for this work." She massages her eyes. "Honestly, I don't know what I expected. I saw promise in you, but also the flaws. And I ignored them. "

She spots you out of the corner of her eye and turns to you, framing a sharp rebuke at your intrusion. Her anger turns to stark amazement when she sees your face.

      <DefaultText>"Of course you didn't," the woman says. "Reaching even the most obvious conclusion requires at least *some* degree of intelligence. I asked you to retrieve the falling star, whatever it was, not assault a stranger, and *especially* not one who happened to be the Changing God!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That was beneath you, Adahn," the woman says. You rise, struggling to focus on her.

Salimeri's arms are folded, and she is distinctly unamused. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head.

"Well," she says. "At least my memory of your temperament is accurate. Despite the name, you never change, do you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>She arches an eyebrow. This was, apparently, exactly the wrong thing to say. 

"You have a scar on your left buttock," she says. "Does that paint a picture, perhaps?"

She trails off, studying your face. A smile blooms. "Oh. Oh, of *course*. You're not Adahn. You're a castoff. Really, you should have said."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A plot!" she exclaims. "Just one? *Please*. It would take nothing short of an army to send you into hiding..."

She trails off, studying your face. A smile blooms. "Oh. Oh, of *course*. You're not Adahn. You're a castoff. Really, you should have said."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>She blinks once, twice. A smile blooms. 

"You're a castoff," she murmurs, studying you from head to foot with an appraising - and somewhat proprietary - eye. "Remarkable. This is rather like visiting a house you once owned, and seeing new tenants through the windows."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You left me in the middle of the night without a word of thanks," Salimeri continues. "After I introduced you to the Order of Truth. Connected you to my contacts at the Oasis. Helped you with your research!"

She settles her hands on her hips, a lone finger tapping her impatience. "What I'm saying is that I have a problem, Adahn. And you're going to help me with it. You owe me that much."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A furious blush creeps down her throat, and though she is hiding it well, her hands are shaking. This is not the reaction of a former colleague or a friend. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods, her face a carefully-composed mask.

"Well, of course you did," she says. "But we are both adults, Adahn. You could have told me rather than absconding by moonlight. I'm not saying I would have been delighted, but I would have at least known you were *alive*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've met members of your little family before, of course. Trailing around in *that* shadow, looking for clues, or trying to repair the damage."

Her smile is genuine and somewhat sad. Her eyes linger on yours, as if looking for *any* flash of recognition. "I can help you, if you like. But I need something from you first."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She barks a laugh in your face. 

"Have it your way," she says. "Miss out on the expedition of several lifetimes for the sake of your *pride*." 

She turns away from you. "Don't let me keep you, Adahn. You were leaving."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course."

She draws your attention to a map of the Reef of Fallen Worlds on her workstation and taps a gilded, ornate structure, not far from the dome containing the resonance chamber. "This is the Anechoic Lazaret. It has been hopelessly sealed since the dawn of the Ninth World until," she smiles, "I managed it in a week or two. It was quite simple once you figured out the trick."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've been slipping in and out at nights, investigating the technology within, taking notes." She frowns. "Then, more recently, I discovered that the structure was sealed again."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I doubt it," she says. "First of all, I haven't told them. The Order has been trying to open the Lazaret for centuries, and I want it to myself for now."

She rolls her eyes. "Secondly, my colleagues are nosy and *somewhat* competitive in a charmingly amateuristic fashion. But none of them have the stones for out-and-out treachery."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No," she says crisply. "I would not make such a careless mistake."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I believe *someone* tramped inside with no regard for the dangers and managed to trigger a failsafe that resealed the structure." She flicks a strand of hair from her eyes. 

"I need someone to reopen the Lazaret and," she waves a vague hand, "handle whatever nonsense the trespassers have stirred up in their wake."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose I could do that," she says. Qorro stirs hopefully. "If I wanted him dead by sundown, and the entire structure looted by strangers. Or aflame."

She arches a cold eyebrow. "Alternately, I could hire someone competent." 

Qorro sags. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Simple," she says. "You are a castoff. All of you were made to be useful in some way or another. All of you are, at minimum, competent. In short, you're better than any of the draff I have at hand."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh certainly," she says with a gentle snort. "Perhaps I could draw upon my literal *seconds* of combat experience, and deal with the potentially violent intruders in a series of sporting one-on-one duels." She gives you a flat look. "On second thought, perhaps we should play it safe."

"I want you to take care of this for me. Needless to say, I would also prefer the structure in an undamaged state, as I left it."

She smooths her robes. "Well. There it is. Will you help?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Besides, I *can* reopen the structure. The concern is what's waiting for me inside." She holds your gaze for a moment to make sure you understand. 

"I want you to deal with whatever's gone wrong in there so I can resume my work. Needless to say, I would also prefer the structure in an undamaged state, as I left it."

She smooths her robes. "Well. There it is. Will you help?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"False modesty?" she says. "That's unlike you. Or perhaps you're fishing for compliments."

She folds her arms. "Very well, if I must. 'You are the Changing God'," she intones. "'The Secret-Breaker. The Nano with a Million Faces. Doors fall open at your word. The deepest mysteries unravel themselves at the touch of your gloved hands."

She cocks her head. "Is that better?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This, as you likely know, is the eye of a mlox, and how I originally accessed the structure. The fact that the Lazaret recognizes this organ as an authorized user implies that its builders were machine intelligences. Maybe a machine *civilization*, from before the dawn of the Ninth World."
