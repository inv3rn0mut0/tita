      <DefaultText>The cage in which the creature floats is a simple frame that contains a shimmering, nearly transparent cylinder of energy. It emits a low hum, barely audible, that sets your teeth on edge. The container is a delicate filigree of ornate materials with no apparent controls... but surely they must be hidden somewhere in the traceries and protrusions of the wirework.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The energy field darkens protectively and automatically as the creature throws itself at its walls, thrashing and striking mindlessly with its needle-tipped tentacles. The darkening is almost a strobe-like effect.

Even as you watch, one of its tentacles coils back and blasts furious plasma at the walls of its cage. The cage holds, but the shields dim to prevent any radiation from the blast from escaping.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hovering creature turns to you, and some of the knobby protuberances swivel and dilate like eyes. A mechanical, flat voice emanates from the orb at the creature's base as it assesses you. "Human appearance. Artificial biological construct. Molecular structure primarily carbon.

      <DefaultText>It draws away from the edge of the energy field for a moment, as if gathering its thoughts - and then it launches itself at you, rebounding off the deceptive solidity of the cage. Its tentacles flail wildly, the needles at their tips glinting and oozing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dim light builds underneath the nychthemeron, the orb at its base glowing brighter and brighter. Two tentacles stroke it, and they pull out a streamer of bright lightning. They stretch it between themselves, building in intensity, and then they hurl it at you.

The walls of the cage darken instantly, and when they lighten again, you see the monster within flailing and crashing fruitlessly against its invisible walls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The calm, machine-like rationality of the nychthemeron is gone. It struggles and flails against its bounding cage, and at the sight of you these attacks increase in magnitude. Its tentacles slap and twist, and the syringes at the tips of some of its extremities spatter a hissing liquid against the invisible walls of energy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You approach the cage cautiously. The monster within looks like a fungal blob mated with a muscular ichthyoid. Its multiple tentacles terminate in syringes, needles, and injectors. This mass sits atop - and is integrated with - a floating orb of some type. It seems to be both mechanical and biological, with one system flowing smoothly into the next, a creation from some mad nightmare.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The scarred glaive ambles over. "Are you trying to talk to this thing? It's only calm at night, and then it's polite as can be." He strokes one of his fresher scars. "'In the daytime, though, it's like as not to blast you into ashes."

He saunters back to his original position, thumbs tucked into his belt, his eyes scanning the crowd.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cage appears to be made of a mixture of synth, spun stronglass, and a lightweight metal, intricately embroidered to create mind-warping patterns, evocative and strange. Energy shifts and flickers among the crevices, somehow being shaped by the form of the materials.

Your closer examination reveals a small panel worked cunningly into the frame of the cage. Some of the filigrees here are worn and smooth, as if slowly eroded by friction. Perhaps these are the controls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You place Beleazar's trinket on the cage near the worn panel. Legs extrude from it, molding themselves to the shape and texture of the cage's materials, and lights flicker up and down its length. 

You back away from the cage slowly as the lights gain speed and duration. The light-show on the cage ends as suddenly as it started, but the nychthemeron inside begins to glow, its skin's colors sliding across the spectrum... and it dissolves from the outside in, unravelling.</DefaultText>

Lights flicker up and down the length of the newly attached control device as it integrates with the cage.

•	Suggest that El-Jinto give his notes to Beleazar anyway (Blue and/or Gold Tide). El-Jinto agrees and hands over set of notes or a datapad (Notes on the Nychthemeron, a quest item) for Beleazar. 
•	Suggest that Beleazar doesn't deserve the notes because he tried to steal from El-Jinto (Indigo Tide). El-Jinto agrees (though he probably comments on the fact that Beleazar's "accomplice" would say such a thing) and doesn't give up the notes.
If the player doesn't reveal Beleazar, then the explorers destroy the teleport device and let the player go. After this, both of them act less favorably toward the player.]

He pokes his finger at you. "You're a fool. A worthless scraping of filth best left to dry out in the sun." He leans in and rasps, "And if it weren't for the levies here, you'd be scraping your brains from the grass. Someday your luck will fail, and you'll find yourself defenseless against your own stupidity. I hope I'm there to see it. But now... well, you've ruined our profits here, and countless lives back home. Time for us to go."
