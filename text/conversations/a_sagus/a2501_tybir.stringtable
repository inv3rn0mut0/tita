He cuts off suddenly as he gets a better look at you. "Oh. It's you. I was looking for a way out of town, but I said I was never going to talk to you again, didn't I?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some of Ris's friends are blaming me for his death, and the authorities want to, er, question me. It's all become a bit... awkward, and I believe a change of scenery would do me good."

      <DefaultText>"Hold on! Did I say I wanted to come with you? After what you did - or rather what you *didn't* do - I'm not sure I do."

      <DefaultText>"Those are two very fine reasons indeed. I forgive you." He looks over his shoulder. "Er, but with everyone and their brother looking for me at the moment, I think it's best I stay here until you're ready to leave. I'll join you then."</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A very touching sentiment," he says with a nod. "I forgive you, and I'm sure, wherever he is, Ris does too." 

He looks over his shoulder. "Er, but with everyone and their brother looking for me at the moment, I think it's best I stay here until you're ready to leave. I'll join you then."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And who said I was interested in going with *you*? That's quite an ego you have there. I don't think there's room enough for both it and me in your party."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you pass a stack of cargo, a familiar figure steps out from behind it, disguised - entirely unconvincingly - as an Aeon Priest. "Er, hello again, lad," says Tybir. "I... I don't suppose you're ready to change your mind about me joining you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, well, it seems Ris is still unhappy with me for leaving him on the gibbet for so long, and he wants to strangle me with my own entrails to show me how it felt. I, naturally, am less enthusiastic about the lesson and would like to avoid it if at all possible."

He takes a breath - finally. "Therefore I was hoping I might join you, er, for protection, if you see what I mean. Strength in numbers and all that."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All right. Come along, then."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you, lad. Thank you. I am much obliged."

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Strength in numbers? Do you mean that, if you join me, we're in danger of Ris attacking us?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tybir waves his hands. "No no. I mean the exact opposite. Ris is an utter coward. As long as you're with me, he won't dare attack. He won't even show his face."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe. Why?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you sure? I'm a man of the world. I know my way around a lot of places."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>Passing the stack of cargo again, Tybir once again peeks out. "Hello, again, my friend. I don't suppose you've changed your mind about having me along? I'm a bit desperate."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>As you pass a big stack of cargo, a paunchy old soldier, disguised - entirely unconvincingly - as an Aeon Priest, edges cautiously into view. He seems eager to keep to the shadows. "Er, hello, friend. I... I don't suppose you're leaving town just now?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Soon, yes. Why?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah.... it's a bit of a long story, but, well, I'm afraid I've gotten on the wrong side of some less than savory individuals, and I need a change of scenery."

He gives you a hopeful look. "So, er, do you require the services of an experienced soldier?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fine. Why not?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you, lad. Thank you. I am much obliged. Er, but with half of Sagus Cliffs looking for me at the moment, I'm afraid I can't actually join you until you're ready to leave town."

      <DefaultText>"I don't know. What do you have to offer?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Besides being an experienced soldier, you mean?" He spreads his hands. "Well, I'm a man of the world. I've been everywhere. I've done everything. I know people in every city in the Beyond and beyond, and most of them owe me favors. Would that be any help to you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If you have so many connections, why do you need my help now?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "My Sagus Cliffs connections are... unhappy with me at the moment. These things happen."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>

      <DefaultText>"All right. You've convinced me."</DefaultText>
