      <DefaultText>The people in the crowd sway as the invisible force hits them. Their fists clench and their eyes grow bright.

The woman in front of you is transformed as well. She twitches with feverish emotion. "I have been so selfish. How could I allow my lust for knowledge to consume my decency. This man must be saved. His pain is all our pain. Until he is free, none of us is free!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"An execution." She gestures toward the man on the dais. "They put the condemned into a trance, and he speaks of the wondrous things he sees.

      <DefaultText>She gives you a strange look. "You speak like one of the priests from the Order of Truth. But you're right, of course, and I wish it had occurred to me before."
