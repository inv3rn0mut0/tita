      <DefaultText>At first glance, this ancient, unmoving construct seems nearly identical to the others in the manufactory. 

It is only when you move close, into the hazy aura of forgelight, that you see the intricate - no, chaotic - whorls of engravings marking every millimeter of its armored frame. And the worker standing behind it is adding even more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To be honest, I don't like thinking about it. All of us went *slightly* insane during our centuries down here before the humans came, but the other Foreman and I don't *dwell* on things like Master Foreman does."

An ember drifts down from the high ceiling between you. "If you want the whole story in excruciating detail, Master Foreman's the one to ask."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The easiest answer to that question is 'we don't have the parts'," Artisan says, then lowers its voice. "But the truth is that I'm afraid. Nothing is going to make me *blinder*, but..." It falls silent. The forge hisses and pops nearby.

"Those first decades in the darkness were the hardest. Then I started seeing patterns in them. Simple at first, then with colors, depth, and shade. Grand cyclical designs." It sighs happily. "I still see them. And I wouldn't trade them for sight."

      <DefaultText>"Hah! That's lovely and sort of accurate, but if I let this pack of wild artists carry on as they wished, I'd be a pile of sparkly alloy dust in a hundred years. Every so often, I have to trigger regeneration protocols. Wipe the canvas."

      <DefaultText>"Because I want to be the most beautiful construct in Sagus Cliffs!" the construct declares. The worker behind it chuckles. 

"Joking!" it says. "My eyes - well, not eyes, but you know - they failed a long time ago. But my other senses are good. *Very* good. So when my workers want to show me a design, they scratch it out on my plate. I *feel* it and give them feedback. Not that some of them need it!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah! Another artistic type. Larga! Get our visitor the contents of Storebox 1-1!"

A moment later, a stocker hurries out and places an oddly-textured object in your hands.

"No charge," Artisan says. "Call it a gift."</DefaultText>

A few minutes later, a stocker hurries out and places a heavy object in your hands.

"No charge," Artisan says. "Call it a gift."</DefaultText>

"It's true! They're difficult in their own ways, of course. We argue - and here, 'we' means Master Foreman and me - but that's to be expected."</DefaultText>

Nested sensors whirr into life on its shoulders and beams of light fan over you in the space of a heartbeat.

It chuckles. "Master Foreman has beliefs. Exhausting ones that it can't help inflicting on others. And our broken friend wants to die, I think. Puts it a different way, but it does. And though we bicker, I care for them. How couldn't I, after thousands and thousands of years?"</DefaultText>

"Machine-based language!" it says, delighted. "Haven't run into that in a while. It says, 'To my daughter. Let this sealed gift occupy your time until I return - and I will return. That is a promise.'"</DefaultText>
