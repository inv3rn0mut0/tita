      <DefaultText>In a stall filled with all manner of dusty parts, connectors, and strange devices, a woman tinkers with a half-assembled power source, peering at it through spectacles that have several adjustable lenses. Her long white hair is disheveled, and the skin of her thin frame is marked with small scars and burns. She looks up curiously as you approach.

"Welcome to Mechela's Mechanicals. I got a bunch of broken stuff and a few things that work. You want any of it, let me know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "Can't say. Sounds like most glaives. Well, maybe not the armor, but I'd remember *that* if I'd seen it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh aye. I know that one. Carked and twitchy. Asked me to ken the workings of some weird old device she had. Obsessed with it - like it was a bit of sniff and she a slave to it. Never seen the like."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Near to killed me when I couldn't make it work for her." She frowns, remembering. "I'd'a been mad 'cept I saw how sick she was with it - shaking, tears, the whole lot. Sent her on her way and wished her luck. She'll need it, poor thing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She leans in. "You seem like the kind would be interested, so I'll tell you. It was a jagged, knobby thing, black and evil, little warts all over. She seemed to think it could help her remember something, but I couldn't even figure if it was on or off."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "Trade mostly. There's an old priest, name's Aligern, who brings me things now and then. Doesn't like to tell me where he finds them, so I don't ask."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now and then. They dig up all kinds of things in those tunnels of theirs. Picky about what they trade for, though. Only want things that'll hold a lightning charge - flash packs, generators, that kind of thing."

Her brow furrows. "Which is weird, now that I think of it, 'cause their eggs hold a charge. Like little batteries, they are. I've even converted a few of 'em to power things. Though don't tell the sticha that. Be like using a baby for firewood, in their eyes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She grimaces. "I'd rather not, to be honest. It's dangerous work for a start. I could end up losing the rest of my eyebrows, and if the sticha ever found out, they'd snip me to pieces with their claws. Those are their babies, you know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She thinks about it for a moment, then nods. "I suppose you're right. But it's still my neck if they find out, so I'm going to charge you [Global: a2301_MechelaPriceForEggs] shins for each cluster of eggs."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>She thinks about it for a moment, then shakes her head. "You're probably right, but the risk isn't worth it. I'll pass."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen behind her lenses. "You wouldn't do that to an old woman, would you? Well, maybe you would. All right, all right, I'll convert the eggs. But you've got to make it worth my while... [Global: a2301_MechelaPriceForEggs] shins for each egg cluster."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Mechela hands you one of the sticha eggs. It is now fitted with small, humming attachments, including a metal prong that could be attached to another device. 

"Some of 'em broke while I was fiddling with 'em," she sighs, "and a couple weren't viable to start with. This one's all that's left, but it's still worth more than you paid."

      <DefaultText>"Looks like you have more than one cluster. How many do you want me to, uh... convert?" Her mouth twists on the final word, as if she almost said something else.

"[Global: a2301_MechelaPriceForEggs] shins for each cluster."
