      <DefaultText>Erritis plucks at his fingers, glancing between the ground and his new employer, plucking at the ends of his fingers. The golden aura about him seems... weaker, somehow. Like a candle flame on the cusp of flickering. 

Hearing your footsteps, he looks up, eyes wide.

"I'm so glad you're back! I have... what are they called... those things that people have when their lives aren't interesting and full of adventure."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes! That word. How do these normal people deal with these things? These nibbling little thoughts? I need to jump! To run and duel and leap, but no!" He lowers his head. 

"I have *work* to do," he moans.

      <DefaultText>"What? No." He grabs your arm. "Why, is someone saying I'm afraid? I'm never afraid! I'll duel anyone who says I'm afraid of anything!" 

He rubs his temples. "No, it's an 'R' word. Rrrrrrr... rerara... regrets! I have regrets! Me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, but I'm so glad you said that!" he says, grabbing your arm. "I've *never* understood why they're so popular. It's just bread with things in the middle!" 

He rubs his temples. "Ugh. My thoughts are getting so *boring*. No, it's an 'R' word. Rrrrrrr... rerara... regrets! I have regrets! Me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nothing happens here! People waddle off their airships, complaining about the food or how long the trip took. No one argues! No one punches a levy, or swings off the ships shouting and throwing daggers! I need to leave. I need to..."

He thumps his chest, abruptly resolute. "No! I swore to serve Rennio. To pay my debt! And that is what I will do!"

He straightens, fists cocked on his hips. "You are a good friend. We should talk more often."</DefaultText>
