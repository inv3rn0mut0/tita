      <DefaultText>The archway is dormant but very much alive. It emits a low but constant hum, just at the edge of your hearing. Across the top of the arch, illuminated words are inscribed: "The House of Empty Time."

Heavy, ropelike cables connect the archway to the ancient device nearby.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The workmanship of this device is quite different from that of the generator. If the generator bears the mark of a brilliant mind, connecting technologies in weird and unexpected ways, this archway is merely clever... like a gifted student imitating the work of a master. You suspect that it owes much of its functionality to the generator from which it draws its power. It also appears to be a more recent construction. </DefaultText>

Finally, you give up your search. If the arch can be activated at all, the method is unclear. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not as impressive as it looks," mutters Aligern. "The real work is being done by the generator there." He points to the ancient device that's connected to the archway by a number of cables. 

"Someone channeled the temporal energies to achieve some purpose of their own. It's a hack job. Must have been an Aeon Priest." He grins wickedly.</DefaultText>
