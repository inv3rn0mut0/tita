      <DefaultText>The face of this armored man is oddly generic, almost as if it was designed to be forgettable. His livery marks him as a soldier in the service of Sagus Cliffs... a 'levy.' The word comes easily to your mind. 

He stares past you, turning a small, charred object over and over in his hands, whispering to himself. His over-large eyes are red, wet, and haunted.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"G-greetings," he says, apparently by reflex. He still hasn't looked your way. "How? How can I help you?"

He closes his eyes hard, as if trying to crush visions that are troubling him.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes?" he says, the despair melting away. In that moment, he looks like a child, with a child's desperate hope. "He knows too, doesn't he? He sees what he did. What *we* did."

Tears leak from his eyes, trailing down into his mouth as he continues. "When the machine ripped the year from him to make me, I felt the choices unravelling before me."

He hugs himself. "I see them coming. None of it can be changed!"</DefaultText>

His eyes squeeze shut. "The fire spread through the neighborhood. People were trapped. People *screamed*." His hand clenches over the charred toy bird in his palms with a soft *crunch*.

"Please tell him. Tell him I'm *with* him in the dark, hiding from the mobs. Sobbing. Tell him... tell him to give me a different year. A better one!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You channel the Tides through the barbed tangle of burning visions that infest his mind. Sizzling, steaming, they rip free of him and pour into you, shredding your thoughts. 

Screams. Charring wood. Running past smoking doors, trying to ignore the fists pounding on the other side. A world of drifting sparks and breathless horror. Small hands beneath a fallen rafter, holding a wooden toy.

A bird.
