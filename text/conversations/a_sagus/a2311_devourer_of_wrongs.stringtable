      <DefaultText>The Devourer of Wrongs seems larger down here than it did in daylight. Its head nearly brushes the roof of the chapel.

As before, you cannot tell if it is looking at you. It doesn't even seem to be breathing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The towering figure appears to be staring into a pocket of shadow in the corner of the chapel. It does not acknowledge your arrival in any way. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That he was not alone in his treason," it says. Its voice is like thunder beyond a mountain range. "The levies are now searching for a man called Tybir. And they will find him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I attend executions and eat the condemned once they are dead. Their meat shows me the extent of their guilt and gives me their memories, revealing motive, method, accomplices, and secrets. The Dendra O'Hur have always performed this service for the city."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We are. Fragments of their consciousness live on in my mind. When I die, I will be eaten by my successor, and so those fragments will pass from one generation to the next... their sorrows and *mistakes* never to be lost or forgotten."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This enormously fat figure stands alone, motionless. Because of its metal mask and the obscuring layers of devices, filters, and hoses it wears, you can't be sure if it's a man or a woman, or even if it is entirely human. Its thick neck bulges and clenches as if it was chewing something.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No. Imbitu has forbidden us from involving ourselves in the investigation."

You glance at Imbitu. The leader of the Dendra O'Hur is picking his rotten teeth with a long, curving fingernail.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"Good," it rumbles at once, as though it had been waiting for the news. "I would have the murderer caught, and caught quickly. It angers me that all of this transpired while I was attending to Ris." Despite the statement, the creature's voice is as placid as a subterranean pond.

"I assume you are here because one of the Dendra O'Hur is suspected of being the murderer. I will tell you what I know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mallet, Gh'zei, or Kiyatawa could be the murderer. Question them, and look for falsehoods. These will lead you to the truth."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have known Imbitu through many minds. He is subtle, clever, and untrustworthy. He is also no murderer." 

It casually clenches a gloved fist. "That leaves the other three. They are all capable of the crime. Mallet is ambitious and desires revenge. Kiyatawa sneaks, plots, and keeps secrets. Gh'zei is not human and does not define murder as we do." The creature's fist falls to its side once more. 

"Talk to them. Search for holes in their stories. These will lead you to the truth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No. Imbitu, our leader, has forbidden us from answering questions about the investigation."

It nods toward an elderly man who stands on the other side of the chamber, near an alter of bone. </DefaultText>
