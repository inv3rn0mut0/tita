      <DefaultText>This woman is dressed much like the levies who flank her, but unlike them, her expression is sober and alert. Her hair is cut short, the corners of her eyes wrinkled with crow's feet.

A little swarm of mechanical drones circles around her, buzzing messages in her ears. She whispers replies in return, and every so often, one of them whisks away, disappearing into the city.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It wants *what*?" Her eyes widen in alarm. She whispers something to one of her circling drones, and it zooms away. 

"Sometimes the levies go wrong. They take a bad year from a citizen and turn out *flawed*. We never let them live when they get like that. You've seen the little talismans they carry, the symbols of the year that made them? If the year is bad enough, they *become* that talisman shaped in flesh... monsters that hide in the city and try to bring about the horrors that would have been."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Drones still circle the uniformed woman's head. She's whispering to one of them as you approach, but she waves it away and nods curtly to you. "City business? Or something else?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What is it, citizen?" She pauses, eyes darting to your tattoo, then to your face. "No... you're the one they call Adahn. I heard you were in the city."

You sense a sudden wariness in her. "It's been ten years since your last visit. I was too young to know you then, but the drones remember."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>On cue, two of her attendant drones dip close to her ear, emitting a stream of raspy noise that might be some sort of language. "You kept to your own affairs, but everywhere you went, the city held its breath. People *deferred* to you, even the ones with power and influence. You looked the same as you do now... exactly the same. I want to know why. And if you don't mind telling me, I want to know what you're doing in Sagus now."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Curious." She regards you for a long moment as if judging you anew. "You came here for a reason... not-Adahn. What's your business in the city, if you don't mind telling me?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Smoking tendrils, grasping talons, a towering, nebulous shape..." She sees the look on your face and nods. "I've seen it, but only through the eyes of a drone. Not long ago, it killed a man in the streets, a man with the same mark you bear."

"If anyone else knew, there'd be panic. Even if it's only hunting... people like you. I haven't told anyone, not even the Council."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The White Death." Her expression goes flat, but her eyes flick to your tattoo again. "I should have guessed that. If Matkina is all you want, then you should ask for her in Underbelly. That's the last place any of my drones saw her, and the levies don't venture there."

She leans a little closer and lowers her voice. "And if you leave the city afterward, I'd be very happy if you took her with you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Another drone swoops past you, stopping just short of the woman's head. It unleashes a series of raspy buzzes and squawks. She whispers something to it, then glances back in your direction. "What was it you wanted?"

      <DefaultText>She gestures at the two burly, smiling men to her left and right. They look like identical twins.

"Soldiers in the Council's service. They keep order in the city." Her lips purse briefly, but she continues. "Every citizen is required to raise a levy for the city's defense. The price is a year of their lives."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A man called Fulsome."  She hesitates, giving you an appraising look, then leans a little closer. "When the Council decides that something can only be accomplished by... alternative means... they go to him, and he finds the right people to help.

      <DefaultText>"The truth?" She glances at the door behind her. "The Council fears the Memovira... the criminal boss of the Bloom. Her power in the city is getting stronger, and she's always had support in Cliff's Edge. I'm not allowed to send patrols there anymore. They didn't tell me why, but I can guess. They're showing the Memovira that she can do as she likes in Cliff's Edge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Most people sacrifice one year of their lives to become a citizen. From their sacrifice, a single levy is born. I sacrificed... more. Voluntarily. I gave up more years than anyone ever has. It helped me *understand* the levies... and it helped them to understand me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Normally when someone gives up a year to create a levy, the two are connected to each other. People can sense which levy is theirs. Something of the levy is transferred to the citizen and becomes a part of him... or her." She frowns. "The Aeon Priests don't tell you that part."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I sacrificed enough years to make a whole squad of levies. It didn't just make me older, it granted me the insight to *understand* them. I can look at them and tell you how many days they have left to live. I can sense the pain they hide, the knowledge of what they are. In the same way, the levies can guess my thoughts and wishes when I am near, and they act before I even command them."

She smiles softly. "They look on me as an elder sister, perhaps, or a well-loved aunt."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I cheated." She's silent for a moment. "When I was old enough to become a citizen - to sacrifice a year to create a levy - I went straight to the Order of Truth, and I told them I wanted to donate as many years as I could."

"I didn't think it would work," she confides, "but what choice did I have? When they started taking the first few years, and I aged closer to twenty... each time, I thought I would die. And the levy that was born from my twentieth year... it was a monster."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Centuries, I think. The earliest reference I could find was around the time of Chila, but it probably goes back even further. There was an Aeon Priest... about eighty years ago, he thought he'd make a name for himself by discovering the cause. He found that it only affects women in Sagus, never in the outlying villages. He thought it might be caused by some kind of numenera underneath the city, but he was never able to prove anything."</DefaultText>
