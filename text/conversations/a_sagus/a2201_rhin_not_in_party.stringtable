      <DefaultText>For a moment it looks like she might hug you. But at the last moment she seems to think better of it and pulls up short a half-dozen steps away. She collects herself, standing straight with her shoulders back. Then she nods, the gesture so polite it's almost formal.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her body grows tense for a moment, her eyes darting around as if deciding whether or not to run away. She glances at the rubble where she had hidden from the thugs...

She relaxes, though her eyes are still wary. "I was running away. There were some... people. Bad people. I ran away and got hurt."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rhin grins, and her sudden smile is like the sun coming out from behind a cloud. "We're good at hiding," she says.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head and begins to back away. She brings both her hands up in front of her, and you realize she's clutching something so tightly that her knuckles are white. "It's Ahl. He's my friend. You can take everything else. But you can't take him...."</DefaultText>

      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>The girl tenses, and her frightened eyes flicker around the landscape. For a moment it looks like she will run, but then she slowly lowers her hand and opens it, revealing a small dark stone with a hole in it. She's outside your arm's reach, but she still holds it close to her chest, protectively. Her eyes never leave yours, her body is still poised to run. 

"This is Ahl," the girl says softly. "He keeps me safe. He knows everything of hiding."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ahl is... a rock."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>82</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No! Ahl isn't one of your 'numenera.' He's... he's a god."</DefaultText>

      <ID>84</ID>
      <DefaultText>She frowns suddenly then, and looks down at the stone. "No. Obvously not." She pauses. "If he *did* he wouldn't have helped us in the first place, would he?" Another pause. "We should ask him." 

It's only after a long moment of confusion that you realize that she's talking to the rock.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rhin opens her mouth as if to say something, then looks down at the stone and closes it again. She nods and puts it into her pocket. "I wish I had something to offer you," she says. "I had some food, but it's mostly all gone now. Maybe I could find..."

Rhin picks up a discarded piece of fruit, but when she straightens back up she seems to lose her balance. She staggers a little, then looks down at the rotten fruit and blinks, looking disoriented. "I'm sorry. What were we talking about?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>99</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks out at the horizon and makes a vague gesture. "Really far away. But... I'm not sure exactly which direction."

She looks around a little, almost as if she were seeking a familiar landmark. "It has to be a long way from here. My home isn't anything like this. There were trees upon trees... The trees here aren't trees like..."

The young girl squints off into the distance. After a moment, her eyes go distant and you realize she probably isn't going to finish her sentence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Without seeming to realize what she's doing, the girl brushes her hand through her hair and you see the side of her head has been shaved. Large stitches run along her scalp, holding together an ugly cut longer than her hand. The wound is purple and angry-looking, only just beginning to heal. It can't be more than a week old.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The girl looks up at you, her forehead creasing a little in irritation. "My name is *Rhin*."

But then she hesitates and looks down, blinking. She reaches into her pocket absentmindedly, "Did I forget to tell him that?" She stands there motionless for a second, then stops and looks up at you again. "No. I think I did."

She looks up at you. "I'm sorry," she says. "My name is Rhin. My food and fire are yours to use before you go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a second, she looks like she's going to be offended. Then her shoulders slump and she gives you a wry little smile. "I don't know why. Aside from being knocked stupid and attacked by thugs, it's been a pretty great day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She makes a dismissive gesture toward her temple. "It's fine. It looks a lot worse than it is - and a lot better than *yours*, anyway."

She smirks, touching the side of her head. "The haircut is pretty awful though, isn't it? I don't think they really needed to shave *quite* this much, do you?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>124</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives a wide grin. "I'll be the envy of every homeless waif in this entire..." She gestures grandly at the landscape, then hesitates. "Barrow?" Her grin fades as the word comes out of her mouth. "Sorry, I meant barrow."

She pauses. Then says, "I know that's not the right word. I mean *barrow*."</DefaultText>

      <ID>125</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her grin is entirely gone now, and her hands make fists as she looks down at the ground, concentrating. Her lips move, and at first you can't hear anything except for the hint of a whisper. Finally her body relaxes. "Yes. Neighborhood. That's the word I was looking for. Neighborhood."

She looks up and gives you a shaky smile. "I offer apologies. It's been a long day."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>126</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks up at you for a long moment, and slowly lets her smile slip away. Without it she seems even smaller. She nods gravely. "At first it was pretty bad. I couldn't stay awake or stand up. Even talking was hard. But it's a little better every day. It doesn't hurt so much any more. But sometimes I still get dizzy when I move around too fast. And I forget things."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>127</ID>
      <DefaultText>She smiles bravely and touches the side of her head again, pressing with her fingertips. "But it's a little better every day," she says again, in exactly the same tone as before, as though she doesn't realize she already said it. "It doesn't hurt so much any more. But sometimes I still get dizzy when I move around too fast. And I forget things."

There's a long pause. She stares at you blankly for a moment, her mouth open slightly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, her eyes lose their vacant look and a grin spreads across her face. "I'm just kidding. I mean, I do sometimes forget things. A little. But that was a joke," she says, then blushes a little and looks down, sheepishly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her smile slips, then disappears entirely. "Right. It does."

She turns away, slipping her hand into her pocket. Muttering to herself, she says, "No, no. I said it first. How could *he* know?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>Rhin's smile slips, then disappears entirely. "Right. It does."

      <DefaultText>She opens her mouth, then closes it again. She nods and puts her hand back into her pocket absentmindedly. "I don't really remember. I think they were... stealers. No. What's the word? Robbers. They wanted to rob me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For just a moment, her eyes flash with panic again, and they dart around like she's getting ready to run. 

Then she touches the side of her head gingerly. "I... don't remember what happened exactly. But I got away. And I ran. And I ended up here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scowls at you fiercely. "I didn't know I was talking to a judge," she says angrily. "I told you I can't remember. Not for days on either side of... whatever happened." 

She looks away, mouth pressed into a firm line.</DefaultText>

      <ID>139</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives a wavering smile. "Oh, it's not all bad. I found some shimmery berries today. So that means I get to play I-Wonder-If-This-Will-Poison-Me later. That's always exciting...."</DefaultText>

      <ID>142</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shrugs nonchalantly. "I don't know. I'm pretty good here. Unless you happen to have any spare food you aren't using. Or water. Or... a blanket. Or a new bed or a house or... y'know... anything at all..." 

Rhin starts out talking with a playful smile on her face, but then her eyes well up. Her voice stays cheerful even as the tears are running down her cheeks. She wipes them away, embarrassed and angry, but her hands are shaking now, and there are more tears, and words continue to pour out of her...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gestures at the rubble and gives a bitter laugh. "Is there anything you could do here that wouldn't help? Right now you could give me half a broken bottle and it would double my available resources."</DefaultText>

      <ID>144</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I offer apologies. It's just that I've been hungry for days. I don't know where I am. My head hurts and nothing makes sense." 

She laughs then, helplessly, with a tinge of trembling panic finally bleeding into her tone. "Gods around me. I'm all broken in my head. The moon is wrong, and I'm so tired of being scared all the time."</DefaultText>
