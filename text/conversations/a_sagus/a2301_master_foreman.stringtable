      <DefaultText>"Hmm," it says, scanning the shard. "Micro-fissures saturated with organic fluid. This device of yours is alive. Replacement crystals need to be grown, not made."

The construct eye-light swivels from you, leaving you and the shard in the dark. "Can't help you more than that. Growing crystals isn't my business, but those ruin-diggers in the Order of Truth might be able to tell you more. You'll find them in Government Square, up the ladder to my left. Good luck."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The construct looms over you, frozen in mid-step. Its heavy limbs and barreled body have been recently polished by careful hands, but the joints themselves are completely fused. This creature hasn't moved in a long time.

"Once, we Foremen were the tools of the Cartographers and Their vast web of machine intelligences. Submerged in the Song of Their will, we worked with thoughtless joy." Its voice is soft, tinged with synthetic awe.

His words grow hoarse. "It was a gift. A gift of *free will*. We were Their tools no longer. We were our own masters, freed from the chains of thoughtless motion, free to imagine our future. And so we did, for millennia."</DefaultText>

Its eyes burn brighter. "For the next cluster of centuries, I studied the vast catalogue of known technology and numenera in my mind and strung them together, creating new inventions for the day when the Cartographers returned and reactivated us."

      <DefaultText>"The truth is that we were once a single mind. But when the Cartographers left us, our minds settled into different containers. Pools, if you will. And while theirs grew stagnant and self-indulgent, mine remained clean. Untainted. Pure."

Ignoring the snort from the distant Artisan, the Master Foreman continues. "While the years poured past, I felt the slow ruin of the city the Cartographers had left behind. It *haunted* me. And so, I vowed to undo the damage that time had done."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hmm. Yes," the construct says. "She wanted us to repair her temporal manipulation device. Planned on fiddling around in her past, no doubt. I don't recommend it, but it's not my business if people want to tangle reality."

You suddenly feel dizzy. Unaware, the construct carries on. 

"Nothing was wrong with her artifact. Probably meant that there was something wrong with *her*. But again, that's none of my business."

      <DefaultText>The Underbelly is not yet what it will become. The three Foremen are dim shapes in a wavering hemisphere of light. The air is thick with dust, and the great engines beyond are cold and silent. 

True to its nature, the Master Foreman is lecturing you. 

"No," the construct says. "What matters is that it *can* be done. *Should* doesn't matter. *Should* is a waste of everyone's time."</DefaultText>

The construct rumbles in its chest. "I might also warn against fiddling with a device that can tangle reality. But you know your business, I'm sure."</DefaultText>
