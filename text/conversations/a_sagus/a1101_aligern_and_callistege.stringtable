      <DefaultText>"Oh, yes, it's *obvious*, Callistege." His voice is grim and clipped. Then he sees you looking at him.

      <DefaultText>"This whole structure seems to be a relic of the Changing God's. I can't say much more about it, though." She focuses hard on you. "That's because you broke it in your fall, and frankly I'm not sure how you survived. Your body knitted itself together - I've never seen shattered bone do *that* before, and believe me, I've seen plenty of shattered bone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scoffs. "Aligern, really. Where's your mental rigor? What makes you so sure this flesh contains his spirit? Look in his *eyes* - they're scared and lost. This is a castoff, and freshly made. Tell me, child," and here she leans in close, "What is the last thing you remember?"</DefaultText>
