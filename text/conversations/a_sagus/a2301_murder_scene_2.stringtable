      <DefaultText>Only thin, nearly transparent slivers of flesh cling to the glistening tendons of the skinned hand. They taste of...

*Agony. Screams that strip a throat raw. A blurred figure, cutting quickly. Teeth, bound by a joyful grin.*

The memory falls apart, leaving you panting. Whoever the murderer is, they took great care to peel all the flesh from the hand, leaving too little to contain any clear memories.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A tiny, skinned hand rests palm-down at the center of the huge pool of blood.  

On the nearby wall, someone has drawn a bloody circle pierced by jagged symbols. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Haven't seen this is a while," she says softly, coming up beside you. "That's no simple circle. That's the symbol of the Children of the Endless Gate."

She snorts. "They're a sect of the Dendra O'Hur that kills people instead of eating them. They call it 'opening the cages'. The Dendra chased them out of the city a long time ago, but it doesn't look like they took the hint. Either that or..." She pauses, thinking. "One of the Dendra O'Hur got tired of waiting for people to die on their own."

      <DefaultText>Fresh blood streams over the circle, yanking you through the hollow at its center into the world beyond. 

A strip of blistered land coils through a void as black as a gaping mouth. The air is thick, foul, and textured with the slickness of maggots. Nausea slams into you, filling your head. Infecting your thoughts. 

And through it all, you sense a mind in that fathomless darkness, spilling towards yours, seeking, tasting. Joyful. Hungry.

      <DefaultText>You shove the horrific memory away from you, slamming your mind shut like a door, and swallowing the knot of nausea in your throat. 

After seeing that world, the bloody pool at your feet seems almost mundane.</DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>You slam your mind shut like a door. The memory claws at you, and for a moment, you see a world beyond the bloody circle - a blistered strip of land winding through a hungry void...

And then, the vision collapses, leaving you breathless and weary.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You recognize the shapes slashed on the wall. It is both a transdimensional doorway and the symbol of the Children of the Endless Gate, a breakaway sect of the Dendra O'Hur.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your hand reaches toward the streaks and bubbles of blood of its own accord, and an iron spike drives through your temples. 

You stand before a blank wall. Sickening purple-black light spills around the corner behind you. This is *your* temple and you have been driven into a dead end. By *her*.

Blood seeps through the wall from the other side, drawing the familiar shape. Frightened, confused, you trace the line... and a gate opens with a wet *crunch*...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You study the dashes and bleeding pinpricks decorating - *binding* - the circle. They aren't symbols in any known human tongue, but you sense their purpose. 

The circle was almost inconsequential. These sigils *gripped* the shape of it and *pushed* it through time and space. This was, however briefly, a transdimensional portal to another place. Now it is dead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is immediately clear that the dashes and bleeding pinpricks decorating this circle are not random. This is a symbol, drawn with careful intent. 

Unfortunately, it means nothing to you. </DefaultText>
