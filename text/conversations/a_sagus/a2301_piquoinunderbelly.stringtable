      <DefaultText>Something seems different about the boy since you last talked to him in Cliff's Edge. No one would call the expression on his face a happy one, but he certainly looks calmer. Taller, even. 

He sees you coming, and nods. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No," he says bitterly. "You should ask Qeek. She saw that carker from the front."

He exhales, rubbing his spotted cheek. "If you hadn't convinced me to come back, I wouldn't have been here. Anything could have happened." He closes his eyes. "Thank you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Here I am. Nothing much has changed down here."

His tone is biting, but you notice his eyes shifting to Crooked Qeek. </DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm not," he says. "We're only going to stay here as long as it takes to convince Qeek that we *shouldn't*. Life is better just about everywhere else in this town. But no. She says that if she leaves, our tribe is truly dead. Instead of, you know, actually dead. Murdered, in some cases."

He lowers his voice. "You wouldn't know it by talking to her, but that girl is as stubborn as dried leather." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You'd think a murder attempt would have changed her mind about living in this trash pit," he says, shaking his head. "But no. 'It's my trash pit, Piquo! No one's chasing *me* away!'"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You almost don't recognize the temperamental mutant boy you met in Cliff's Edge. Piquo's eyes drift over you blankly. He is as pale as if the pool of blood at his feet is his own, and in the dark of the Underbelly, the ragged red crease dividing his face glows.

"I d-don't understand," he whispers. "They told me she was here, near the water. Where is she?" He swallows, looking away from the tiny, flayed, misshapen hand before him. "Where's Crooked Qeek?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's... what's left of her. I'm very sorry, Piquo."</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No. That hand's too small," he says, his voice breaking. "It has to be someone else's." 

He turns away to shut out the ragged remains of his friend. The candle flames bathe his face in raw, red light and deep shadow. </DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You made me come back," he moans, pressing his hands to his temples. "They're all dead. If I'd stayed up there, if I'd *changed*, I never would have known. I would have been *happy*."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"Don't blame me. This is your fault."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He flinches. For a moment, tears threaten to blind him. Then, he slashes his forearm across his traitorous eyes and glares at you.

"They were content to suffer," he growls. "To be ignored. Maybe Qeek would have lived if I'd come back sooner. If I'd never left. Or maybe I would have died *years* ago. No one would have saved her *then* either. No one would have noticed!"

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>Gritting his teeth, he turns his back on you and walks away, leaving you alone with the remains of Crooked Qeek.

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I wish I was!" he screams. Tears fly from his eyes like shining beads. "What good does knowing she's dead do me? What is knowledge worth if all it does is hurt?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're thinking about this wrong. You're free now."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Free," he says, laughing bitterly. He slashes his forearm across his streaming eyes and glares at you. 

"I'm going to see her skinless hand every time I close my eyes until I die. Does that sound like freedom to you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm sorry I brought you here."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>He blinks once, delicately, and tears spill from his eyes as if your apology was the only thing holding them back. 

"It's not your fault," he says, cradling himself in shuddering arms. "She would have lived if I'd come back sooner. Or if I'd never left."

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>He glares at you, his tears held back by the walls of his grief, waiting for you to shout at him... to blame him as he blames himself.

When it becomes clear that you are not going to do either of these things, Piquo chokes back a sob, and spits at your feet. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No," he says, swallowing, turning away to shut out the ragged remains of his friend. The candle flames bathe his face in raw, red light and deep shadow. 

 "Yes. Yes, I know."</DefaultText>
