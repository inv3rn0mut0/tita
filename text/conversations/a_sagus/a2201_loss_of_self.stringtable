Her eyes are shining now. "I see... I see my parent's faces! I don't remember their names, but... I can ask them! When they come to visit!"

She squeezes your hand. "Thank you. The woman in my head's not quiet. Not yet. But she's *quieter*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She listens to your story, eyes downcast. It's a long time before she speaks, and when she does, her voice is thick with anger.

She looks at you. "Did I tell you? I found it beneath a pile of blackened scales in some building I'd never seen before. I just... woke up there one morning."
