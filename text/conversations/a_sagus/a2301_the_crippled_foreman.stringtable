      <DefaultText>Segments of this bisected construct's legs lie scattered around it. Someone has painstakingly altered these pieces, giving them small limbs and tiny metallic heads.

Nonetheless, they aren't moving. The larger construct's turquoise eyes flicker out of sync with each other as they turn towards you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It does not protest, so you examine the motionless constructs on the ground in front of the Foreman.  

From what you can understand of the technology here, the Foreman is correct. These little constructs should be working, but they aren't. It may be possible that the flaw is not in *them*.

You share this information with the Foreman. "I agree," it says. "And I believe a new direction has presented itself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My children need more energy to live, but my construction prevents me from transfers above a certain threshold, and for good reason."

Its pupils rotate, contracting. "Energy transfers above a certain percentage would lead to a chain of ruptures in my intelligence rings. I would die."

Its voice mesh clicks. "Help me force myself to make this transfer, for I cannot do it myself." 

*click* "Help me give my life to my children."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vision falls on you like a wave swallowing a swimmer. 

You approach this Foreman - still possessed of its legs - and open the same hatches that Tarnish did. 

"I know it looks complex," the Foreman says. "But the viaducts are the simplest part. The machine spirit - me, that is - is trickier. Even I don't fully understand it." It laughs. "Me."

The vision fades, leaving you standing before the ruins of that once-cheerful construct again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Working blindly, you jam your hands into the Foreman's body, ripping, realigning, and doing untold amounts of damage in your attempt to fulfill the construct's wishes. 

Eventually, you succeed. Cold energy pours through the air like blood from a wound, flooding into the motionless children. One by one, their tiny eyes flicker into life. One by one, the Foreman's eyes go out. Its voice mesh rattles, as if it's going to speak...

      <DefaultText>Without another word, you open yourself to the Tides, becoming a conduit between the construct and its children. You inhale, and with a single thought, unravel the tangled logic binding the construct's life to its ancient body. The children stir. 

In you, for the briefest moment, the construct and its children meet, but their thoughts and the words that pass between them elude you.  

You stagger back and raise your aching head. The Foreman is smoking and broken.
