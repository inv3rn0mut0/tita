      <DefaultText>The pages of the book are made of thick vellum, and it appears to be an atlas of the region. The book is open to a map that depicts the city of Sagus Cliffs, the Valley of Dead Heroes nearby, a range of mountains to the north, labeled as the Ossiphagan Range, and a circular desert farther to the east, marked as the Lost Sea. 

A thin strip of fabric has been placed between the open pages. A second fabric strip marks another place in the book.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your clumsy attempt mangles the lock. No one will ever be able to open it properly again. However, your hamfistedness has weakened the drawer, which should now be easier to force open.

      <DefaultText>Inside you find a small ornamental comb that looks like a jeweled insect. In fact, it *is* a jeweled insect - a biomechanical marvel that is very much alive. The pincers seek to fasten themselves upon locks of hair, and its wings allow it to hover around the wearer's head. 

Several strands of hair are still clutched in the comb's pincers. They are a vibrant purple.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You wrench at the drawer and it flies open, sending a shiny object from inside arcing through the air. Before you can get a good look at it, it skitters off the edge of the platform and plummets toward the ocean far below.

While you can't tell exactly where the object landed, you can see that the water narrows to a tiny inlet at the edge of a cavern entrance.

{JESSE: I like the reactivity here - let's set a variable and implement this. I've made a note in the dialogue description for the fishing lines, but you'll need to modify the existing a2301_fishing_lines dialogue to include the hair comb. It'll be another option that follows node 19. Please coordinate with Gavin so that he can update the text once you add this,}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The book appears to be an atlas. It is currently open to a map that depicts the city of Sagus Cliffs and the surrounding region, including the nearby Valley of Dead Heroes and a circular desert called the Lost Sea.

A thin strip of fabric has been placed between the open pages, with another marking another place in the book.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Based on the condition of its pages, you can guess that the book is about twenty years old. The vellum was probably made from the skin of a herd animal - a young aneen, perhaps, or a gallen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The book doesn't seem new - its pages are worn from frequent use - but that's all you can discern. It might be anywhere from ten to fifty years old. No dates are stamped on any of the pages.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Besides Sagus Cliffs, you only see a few other cities and towns. In the center of the circular desert are a large blue dot labeled 'The Oasis of M'ra Jolios' and a smaller dot immediately next to it, 'Jerboa.' On the far side of the desert is another city, 'Haref.' 

On one end of the Valley of Dead Heroes is a dot labeled 'The Necropolis.' It's unclear whether this is a settlement or just a site of interest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see another full-page map, this time representing a region called Augur-Kala. It seems to be located somewhere to the northwest of Sagus Cliffs, and it's defined by a massive ring of mountains labeled as the Clock of Kala. The mountain range is so perfectly round that it was almost certainly engineered by artificial means in the distant past.

Several cities and towns dot the landscape, but the largest and most prominent is named Sada-Imidu.

After a few moments, you turn back to the map of the Sagus Cliffs region. </DefaultText>

On one end of the Valley of Dead Heroes is a dot labeled 'The Necropolis.' This must be the site you visited in the Valley.
