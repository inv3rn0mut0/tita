      <DefaultText>You draw closer, but the wispy form of the woman in the booth does not clarify. You can hardly discern the details of her ghostly face, and you hear a chorus of whispering female voices that swarm around her like chance moths.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You peer more closely at her, and she takes no notice of you. Her features are those of a teenage woman, leaving childhood behind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She has been ignoring you, but - without a transitional state - her face is suddenly and furiously focused on yours.

Another flicker, and her hands wrap around your throat. Ghost or not, her fingers are very real, and they are choking the life from you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You manage to wrest her fingers from your throat, and you hurl her away. You come up in a crouch, ready for another attack, but she is looking away from you, as if nothing had happened.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her fingers dig deeper. She's not just compressing your trachea - she's tearing your throat out! You choke and cough, drowning on your blood, but she is latched inside you, and the last thing you see is her rage-twisted face.</DefaultText>

Your memory sparks, faintly... these clothes look familiar to you. Wait. They're familiar because they were the fashion in Sagus Cliffs nine centuries ago, and your mind has dredged that association from its depths.</DefaultText>

You have seen her face before, somewhere in this city. The ghostly woman could be her twin.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>They are on the verge of comprehensibility, but they brush against your mind just below the level of conscious thought. You have a sense of vague longing, of loss that touches you and leaves you empty.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>They brush against your mind just below the level of conscious thought. You hear them, but not with your ears.

You can only make out snatches of the whispers in your mind: "You killed me... created me... never wanted to die..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[In the final game, you'll wake up in a new fathom of the Labyrinth where you can learn more about the ghostly woman and her origins. That fathom hasn't been implemented yet, so for now just enjoy an extra XP bonus.]</DefaultText>
