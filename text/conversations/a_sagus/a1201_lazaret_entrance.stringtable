      <DefaultText>This metal door is thick, heavy, and unmarked by time. Double rows of circular bumps run horizontally and vertically across its surface. 

As you approach the door, one of the bumps suddenly slides open, revealing a circular aperture. A few tiny, waving strands of synth emerge from the hole.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The metal surface is infused with miniscule threads that are barely visible to the human eye. They only run in straight lines and right angles, and they seem to converge at the circular bumps. 

Upon closer inspection, you notice that each of the bumps is unique - some have flat faces, others are actually many-sided polygons, and a few are marked by tiny apertures. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The metal is infused with miniscule threads. They seem to converge at the circular bumps, all of which are subtly different from one another.

You don't find anything that seems to be an access device, and touching the door has no effect.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Unfortunately, you don't see anything that resembles a knob, keyhole, or access device. You try touching both the flat planes of the door and the small bumps, but nothing happens. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The waving strands whip out, wrapping themselves around the eye. For a moment, the eye comes to life, buzzing and whispering, getting warmer in your hand. The synth fibers make soft, fluttery sounds in return. After a moment, they withdraw.
