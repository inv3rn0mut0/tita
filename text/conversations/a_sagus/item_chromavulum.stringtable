      <DefaultText>You take the object out of your pack and hold it up by the attached cord, studying it as it spins before you. It reminds you of certain creatures found in the sea attached to rocks, only this one has a cord of material looped through a hole in one of its legs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The creature has tough, briny skin and seven spindly legs that emit radially from a thicker, fleshy disc at its center. Around the disc on one side is a circle of puckered flesh surrounding a tightly closed muscular flap, while the other side has a similar flap but is otherwise smooth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The creature's seven legs project from a disc with a closed flap on either side. A loop of stretchy material runs through one of its legs.</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>The material is flexible but soft, stretching up to nearly twice its original length when you pull on it. Your best guess is that the loop was meant to allow the creature to be worn in some fashion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Inclining your head, you slip the loop over and around your neck, where it contracts to fit snugly. The attached creature settles over your chest. You walk a few paces and find that it's somewhat uncomfortable to have the creature thumping against you with every step. After a minute or so of this you feel silly and start to take it off.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stretch the loop of material to its limit and slip it over your shoulders and down around your waist. Some might find it stylish, but it has no effect.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you pull the loop up back over your head, the creature brushes against your face and suddenly twitches. You wrench the creature away and watch for signs of further movement, but it seems just as lifeless as before.

Cautiously, you bring the creature closer to your face. At first, it does not respond, but as you move it around, you discover that it only comes to life when it's near one of your eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Stretching the loop slightly, you gingerly place it around your head, allowing the creature to settle just in front of your right eye. It comes to life, contorting its legs to match the contours of your face. Your right eye is completely blinded by the obstruction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, you experience a sensation not unlike someone blowing a single puff of air directly into your eye. You blink several times involuntarily, but only with your free eye. The creature is forcefully keeping your other eye open. Probing around the creature's edges, you discover that it has formed a perfect seal over your eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tears form in your covered eye, and a wet slithering noise accompanies a most bizarre sensation as your vision clears. It takes you a moment to realize that the creature is blinking *for you*, which is quickly displaced by the realization that you can once again see out of the previously blinded eye. The creature is still in place, but you are somehow looking *through* it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While much of the world appears the same through your 'covered' eye, certain things appear in hues that are wholly unfamiliar to you. Your mind struggles to process what it's seeing, and you know that if you had to attempt to describe the colors to someone, you would fail utterly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You fit the loop around your head, and again the creature seals itself to your eye. When it opens, the world is once again awash in strange colors. You take a moment to appreciate the sheer beauty of the spectacle around you before removing it once more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As wondrous as your newfound sight is, you find it highly disorienting and resume your search for a way to detach the creature. After some experimentation, you discover that simply removing the loop from around your head causes the creature to release its grip. You feel around your face for any permanent scarring, but the creature has left no mark.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Delicately, you feel around the surface of the creature. You find that the creature's briny skin has slid aside to reveal a smooth, slightly flexible substance that seems to be acting as a lens. Each time you tap it, the creature *blinks*, the muscular flap swatting your finger aside as it presumably cleans the lens.</DefaultText>
