      <DefaultText>Qorro breathes heavily, badly hurt already. "You're tough, I'll give you that. But I ain't finished yet." He pulls out a can of sprayflesh and quickly applies it to his wounds.

As he does so, you sense a regenerative energy field from the construct that could enhance the recuperative effect. You feel a surge of power, like when you drove away the Sorrow fragments. You can't stop Qorro from healing, but you could disrupt the field.</DefaultText>

"You're tough," Qorro says. "I'll give you that. But we ain't finished yet." He pulls out a can of sprayflesh and quickly applies it to his ally's wounds.

      <DefaultText>You send your power more subtly into Qorro's mind, twisting it to shape your will. You can't stop him from healing, but you can shift him to appeal to his selfish nature.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The regenerative field interacts with the spray, making it more effective than normal.

Qorro smirks. "Didn't I tell you, lads? Happened to me once before. Something in the Reef interacting with the spray, I'll bet. Now take them!"</DefaultText>
