      <DefaultText>This young woman wears finely polished armor and paces back and forth restlessly on the walkway. Her long hair is lustrous and healthy, and her whole form exudes a wholesome vitality.

I have been trying to convince some veteran warriors of their eminent suitability to join the Endless Battle. So far they have rebuffed me, but perhaps you can succeed where I have failed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Much as it sounds," she says. "It stemmed from a rift between the Changing God and one of his offspring and has endured for hundreds of years. Raging over the same battlefields, using the deadliest technology of the ancients, the landscape is scarred and pitted beyond recognition. The walls between dimensions are thin there. Every day, horrors cross into our world."

She stands, arms akimbo. "Worse, in recent years, the struggle has expanded."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "Conflict shapes us all. It sharpens us, makes us stronger than we ever thought we could be. If you hide from it, you'll never know what you might have become... or worse, you'll be easy prey for those who are stronger or crueler than you." 

She clutches your shoulders. "These veterans have grown tired and complacent, I want to help them recapture what they lost. No... I want to make them even *greater* than they were."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What is there to talk about? Challenge, response. Thesis, antithesis, synthesis. Overcoming weakness is the only way we grow strong. Do your muscles grow through disuse? Does your mind sharpen while staring at a wall? Life itself is conflict. Without conflict, there is only... stasis. Or worse, decay."

      <DefaultText>"I have been *not wanted* in many places. Yet somehow I never left, except of my own accord. It is a pity I arouse discomfort in them, but perhaps they should examine why that is. Do they fear a new challenge?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You managed to acquire all three of the major players? I would not have thought it possible. Perhaps we should speak of a more permanent engagement for you in recruiting warriors. The Endless Battle will know their coming, and should they survive it, our veterans here will become some of the most feared people on Earth's psychic landscape. The world is a better place for your work. Take this as a reward."

She hands you a strange device.

      <DefaultText>For the first time, she seems discomfited. "Would you... you wouldn't. They have a strict prohibition against physical violence here. They won't let you touch me. Would they?"

She studies your face and shoots a glance at the assembled patrons. They are studiously ignoring the both of you, though you can feel their focus.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs delightedly. "Such spirit! You'll shed no blood in here, stranger. They've a strict policy about physical violence in their establishment. Why do you think I've been given such latitude to remain? Come now. Let's be - " She grins wolfishly. " - *civilized*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... all right. If that's how they feel, I'll leave. I don't need any trouble. Please - please accept my apologies."

      <DefaultText>She staggers back from you, clutching her head. Blood sprays from her nose like an uncapped geyser, and she claps her hand across her face. She sinks to her knees. "Oh gods... I'll leave... I'll leave!"

The other occupants of the bar are staring at you, as if you have just screamed in her face, and then they turn back to their drinks... almost as if they have already forgotten what occurred.</DefaultText>
