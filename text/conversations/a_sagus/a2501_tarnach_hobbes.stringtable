      <DefaultText>This man's brow is creased with worry.  He avoids your gaze, his eyes fixed on a point to your left and far away. His trembling, battered fingers pluck at the air. He stares through the chattering customers, the bar, as though he is utterly alone. 

Stepping closer, you see a thick blue crease running down his throat into the depths of his heavy robes, and orderly rows of azure holes pierce his bony arms from elbow to wrist.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Dischord," he says as you approach. "Scarred melody. Too many voices. H-hurts."

His words stream out one by one in a subdued and continuous monotone, tumbling over each other as if in a blind rush to escape. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Instead of asking to see your belongings, he looks at you for the first time. His pupils are as dark as the space between the stars. 

"No," he says after a long moment. His eyes flick back to whatever distant, terrible place has so captured his attention. "You're wounded. A broken instrument. He has no use for you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The grand hall. The spiral pinned by broken columns. The invisible roof-" He stops with a gasp, and a tear rolls down his dirty cheek. "He tells me not to share our secrets with you. You are not of the Choir. You are dischord."

A cold wind coils down from the rooftop, flicking at his tattered robes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, you hear something beneath the flutelike notes of the breeze over the holes in the man's skin - a dry, angry voice speaking the word 'Akar'.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wayfarers bring me broken numenera. I repair them for pay. I need to eat!" he cries, and you don't think you're the target of his anger.

"The wayfarers *thank* me," he says, swallowing. "They do not know I have remade their numenera. They do not know they will also be remade."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You may as well have slapped the man. 

White with shock, he doubles over, clutching at his chest. Beneath the man's agony, you sense... otherwordly indignation and ageless despair, deep as oceans.

"Great Akar was once the mightiest of cities, and it will rise once more when the Choir awakens." His gaze meets yours. "The Conductor will reward your curiosity and allow me to tell you what I have seen. You need only ask."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Before my becoming, I found a pit ringed by stone, deep in the Arvrin Wood. Broken pillars at the edges. I stepped inside. Breathed the dusty air." He pauses, passing a shaking hand over his mouth. 

"I was lost in the Grand Hall for days. Decades. Pillars twisting like hallways, spiraling. The ringing of bells. Whirling chandeliers. Listening to the song of the lost Choir. I was an audience becoming an instrument. Finally I slept, and I woke here, upon the heights."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He took my voice," the man says, his eyes dull and distant. "But my blood sings. I am becoming. I dream.  And I remake numenera for wayfarers so they will become and dream as well. And together, we will go into the forest, to the ring where the Grand Hall once stood. And rebuild."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"An instrument," he says, swaying. "A doorway. Before, I remade numenera. Now, I wake and find devices the Conductor has made for me. He is generous." 

"Look," he says, smiling, and pulling aside his robes to bare his bony chest. Countless devices are embedded in his flesh, looping bloodlessly in and out of his ribs, linked by tubes or wire to an opalescent sphere at the base of his throat. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gasps again and clutches at his chest. Beneath the man's agony, you sense... otherwordly indignation and ageless despair, deep as oceans. 

"Not ruins. Fallen to the foundations, yes. Akar will rise once more when the Choir awakens." His gaze meets yours. "The Conductor will reward your curiosity and allow me to tell you what I have seen. You need only ask."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You study the blue crease - the subcutaneous cable - leading up from the sphere into his skull. You suddenly recall seeing a similar device in your studies and understand what this one is meant to do. Soon, this man will go to sleep, and something will wake in his place, in his body. 

A 'doorway' indeed. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He does not meet your eyes as you step closer to examine him. Instead, he winces, as though your presence is somehow painful to him. 

You watch him move and track the twitching of his fingertips. You hear a low, vibrating whistle, though it is not coming from his mouth.</DefaultText>
