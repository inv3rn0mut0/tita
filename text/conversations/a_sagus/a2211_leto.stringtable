      <DefaultText>Though this woman's face is young, she has been beaten hard by the sun. She wears a tight-fitting skinsuit under loose desert robes. Her eyes are a deep and unsettling black, with no whites to be seen - occasional streaks of light race across them, flashing in the shadows of her hood like stars plummeting from the sky.

"I am Leto," she says. "I saw your coming. Now you are here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She has lowered her head toward the surface of the bar. She holds a small, smoking stone in her hands. "I have failed," she whispers. "Dhama is dead. I could not close off his future... not without sacrificing others, far worse."

She holds her hands out, imploring. "My eyes have seen too much, and my voice has done too little. Take my eyes from me, and stop the visions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her deep eyes center on you, and they flash. You are drawn into her prophecy, and for a brief moment, you see the world as she does - a wonderful, terrifying tapestry of possibility.
