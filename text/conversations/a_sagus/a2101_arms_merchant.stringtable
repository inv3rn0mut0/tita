      <DefaultText>The sign over this stall says, 'The Arming Room - Buy - Sell - Trade.' Under the awning, a skinny man with stooped shoulders and a concave chest is cleaning a filth-caked weapon of some kind. 

He salutes you with a greasy hand. "Done in a moment. Have a look around. If you need anything, let me know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sign over this stall says, 'The Arming Room - Buy - Sell - Trade.' Under the awning, a skinny man with stooped shoulders and a concave chest is peeking out at the dark sky. 

He shakes his head as you approach. "Strangest thing I've ever seen. Ah, well, can't let a little darkness stop the wheel of commerce can we? What can I do for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good place for the arms trade. Not much call for weapons in the city proper, it's true... the levies keep things quiet." He shrugs. "I get most of my business from mercenary companies. The Endless Battle draws 'em by the dozens." 

"Explorers, too. Plenty of carkers save up their shins and kit themselves out, all fancy-like. Then they wander down the Reef, or into the Bloom, and never come back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't think so. They don't come prowling around here much." He thinks for a moment. "You might try down by the grassy stair. They get a little more traffic than we do."</DefaultText>
