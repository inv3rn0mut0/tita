      <DefaultText>This woman's face seems timeless - neither old nor young, unblemished but somehow not *perfect*. Her dark and wavy hair floats like a cloud to her shoulders. When she speaks, her voice is musical, almost artificial. "I'm Ziobe. And you are..." she concentrates, fingers pressed to her temples.

When her tablemates start smiling, she pulls them away. "I'm not actually a mind-reader like these two. Just a joker."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I? I am Ziobe. I hail from the western reaches of the Clock of Kala, near Matheunis." She bows her head modestly. "I have had the opportunity to serve with my fellows here in a number of disturbances... though if you wish to hear more about those conflicts, you must speak with Dhama. I am their support, their backup, and if need be, their physical offense."</DefaultText>

Life is easier when you're among friendly people, those of your own kind." She laughs. "Though not everyone here is technically one of us. Some of the people you see here are manifestations of our minds. Some of them were called here by our minds. Some have come from other dimensions, even!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>{COLIN: NOT FOR 1E}

The player can ask about Riastrad. If he's present in the bar, Ziobe will point him out. If he's not, she'll say that his past has come back to cause him trouble, and the player should ask Dhama where he is. If Dhama is already dead or gone (and the player hasn't learned what happened to Riastrad), she'll tell the player that Riastrad was grabbed by the Memovira's thugs and taken to the House Where Secrets Die. It's here in Cliff's Edge, but it's separated from the main ledge by a wide gap that can only be crossed by a numenera bridge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ziobe will also tell how Feriok died ("killed" by an Adversary in the psychic war - basically ended up brain dead). We might also imply that Ziobe loved Feriok and it is her mind that is creating him here (details up to the writer) - this might also be the reason that she refuses to leave the bar under any circumstance (see below).</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>o	If the player was forced to kill Riastrad and Satsada in the House Where Secrets Die (and Riastrad is back in the bar), Ziobe should say that Riastrad's ghostly companion is dead, and he is nothing but an empty shell now.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She ducks her head, embarrassed. "My regrets." You feel a wave of psychic pressure roll across you, reaching across the bar - it is a soothing presence, an apology. "I should not have reacted as I did. Feriok's condition... I blame myself for the loss of his... his vision. Had I been better prepared, I might have focused my attack.

      <DefaultText>"I began manifesting him after he was killed. He was our spotter, the man who saw the Adversaries and lured them to our battleground. But the last Adversary we fought... it was ready for us. It caught hold of the lure he offered, and it followed his mind all the way to reality. It burned - " She pauses, chokes back a sob. "It burned him from the inside."

She looks into the distance. "He lured it to us, and with his dying will nailed it into place."</DefaultText>

      <ID>65</ID>

Her voice turns hard. "We beat it, though. So as long as I'm breathing, I'll keep his memory alive. He'll serve his drinks and make his bad jokes, and everyone here will feel welcome. It's the least I can do in his name."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You have my gratitude." The iris in her forehead opens again, and her strange eye peers out at your again. She tilts her head forward, and you hear an audible click from inside her head. The eye falls out, trailing a segmented cord, and she catches it deftly. 

She feeds the new eyestalk into the hole. Something catches it, and internal machinery drags it into place. She looks through her new eye for a moment, closing her human eyes, and nods. The iris closes.

"My thanks," she murmurs.
