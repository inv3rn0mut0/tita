      <DefaultText>This portly man's cracked and bleeding hands are always moving - picking fretfully at his thick lips, running through his thinning hair, or molding aimless shapes in the air. His clothes are marked with paint, dust, dried blood, and clay. 

His eyes brim with frustrated tears as he studies the strangely-familiar sculptures arrayed about him. </DefaultText>

He claws absently at his sparse beard. "What am I not seeing? What am I *missing*?"</DefaultText>

He coughs a cloud of dust. "And I wouldn't sell it to anyone in any case, not even for a tuft of bread. None of them are worth buying. None of them are *right*."

Zaofi kneads his eyes with his fingers. "It is *meant* to be a portrayal of a man, and the amorphous predator that devoured him."

But he will be forgotten unless I capture him here. And I cannot do that unless I know what *drove* him."

Zaofi swallows. "The moment he fell, I ran for the street. But the Dendra O'Hur claimed his body and took it away - probably to their foul chapel in Underbelly. Now I'll never know *who* he was."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I worked into the night, capturing the victim's grief, his boundless guilt, in every line of his face. I wept as I worked, feeling his loss as keenly as though *my* daughter had died." 

His lip trembles. "And then, I felt her behind me. The icy indifference of the void mingling with an inhuman curiosity. She leaned over me, studying the sculpture. And she s-said..." Zaofi pauses, visibly gathering his courage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I cannot!" Zaofi declares, then coughs into his elbow. "I am trapped by the blinding chains of my insight. The man braved the unknown, even though it killed him! He is the avatar of our race's soul. If I define his face, his death means nothing!"

Zaofi draws himself nobly erect. "And so, I will embody the opposite by sitting here, and letting the world watch me decay. My death will inspire others to follow this stronger man's example!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zaofi stares at you, dumbfounded. "Yes!" he says finally. "Gods around us, yes! Somebody gets it."

He points a trembling finger at the faceless, stone human. "He stared eternity in the face and did not blink! But he will be forgotten unless I capture him here. And I cannot do that unless I know what *drove* him."

Zaofi swallows bitterly. "The moment he fell, I ran for the street. But the Dendra O'Hur claimed him first. Now I'll never know *who* he was."</DefaultText>
