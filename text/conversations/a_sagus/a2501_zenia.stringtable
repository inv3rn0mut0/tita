      <DefaultText>This woman is dressed in brightly colored, loose-fitting clothes. Her clothes are adorned with beads and baubles made of some material you haven't seen in Sagus Cliffs.

She paces back and forth near one of the airships, muttering a variety of words - curses, most likely - in a foreign language.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her dark eyes scrutinize you up and down. She softens. "You mean that genuinely, I can tell. Yes, something's wrong. I've got a hold full of valuable Sagus preserves and a handful of wealthy passengers seeking passage to the Oasis, but they're all *worthless*. The city council won't let anyone travel to the Oasis until they've solved some damned political squabble. I'm stuck here until they do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks up to the sky in exasperation, though it doesn't seem directed at you. "Political tensions," she says finally. "The council doesn't like the way the Oasis's leading Giash has been handling certain situations. Of course the Giash aren't the ones suffering for it, are they? Just those of us trying to get home or make a living."</DefaultText>
