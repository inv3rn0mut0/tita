      <DefaultText>This thin, fidgeting Aeon Priest shoots furtive, sidelong glances at the creature in the nearby 'cage' while humming a nonchalant tune. When he sees that you're watching him, he flinches. Over the course of a few, frantic breaths, shock becomes embarrassed anger, and he opens his mouth to shout at you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Engrossed in studying the caged creature out of the corner of his eye, Beleazar doesn't notice you've returned until a few seconds pass. He flinches and glares at you.

      <DefaultText>Then he spots Aligern at your side and sneers. 

"Oh, look. You found someone to chase shadows with, Aligern. How much are you paying him to pretend your blather makes sense?"

He spits at your companion's feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aligern raises his eyebrows at the spatter of wet dirt.

"It's nice to be famous. Not that you'd know, because I sure as hell don't know you." 

He smirks in your direction. "Typical Order of Truth acolyte here, treating tasty gossip as evidence. Doesn't matter if something's true, so long as it's *interesting*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aligern barks a laugh.

You turn back to Beleazar. The young priest is regarding both of you sourly. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What?" Beleazar says, jumping. Then he takes a breath and struggles to sound offhand. "It's a nychthemeron. A biomechanical creature. An information gatherer, in fact."

He seems to calm down as he warms to the topic. "They're dangerous, though. You can only speak to them at night. During daylight, they'll attack without provocation."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Certainly," Beleazar says, wetting his lips. "They gather information, and display mindless hostility during the day. You can only reason with them at night. No one knows why." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Frowning at your words, Beleazar turns to regard you. Then he notices your tattoo, and his eyes go wide.

"I've *heard* of people like you. What are you doing... no, never mind, you just asked me... I mean..." He trails off, and seems to reach a decision. 

"I'm working on something dangerous. And it would be an honor if you could lend your assistance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Beleazar weighs the intent of your words with narrowed eyes. 

"Something you'd likely find interesting," he says, with some reluctance. "But I'm not quite willing to discuss my ideas yet. Leave me alone, please."

He returns to his careful observation of the distant nychthemeron. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Beleazar glances around the plaza as if looking for spies, then beckons you to him. 

"I have a device," he says in a hoarse whisper that can probably be heard from meters away. "If someone can get close enough to affix it to the creature's cage, it will activate and teleport the nychthemeron to the Reef of Fallen Worlds." He snickers, and rubs his hands together. "And then... "</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Biomechanical organisms fascinate me, and nychthemerons doubly so. I've never gotten to examine one up close. So," he lowers his voice, "I want you to teleport the creature out of its cage, kill it, and bring me the, er... memory organ."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Beleazar exhales sharply. 

"I never learn," he says, and you see he is on the verge of frustrated tears. "Why do I..." He presses his lips together, and lifts his eyes to yours.  

"What's done is done. You want to be part of this? Fine. Do what I ask, and I'll pay you well. Betray me, and you get *nothing*, understand?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You spoke with it?" Beleazar sputters. "It knows what I..." 

His eyes dart between you and the captive creature. "It wants you to help it escape, doesn't it? Well, I am *not* going to help! And you would be a fool to ally yourself with that creature."</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>Beleazar toys fretfully with his hands, glances at the sky as if it will advise him, then sags. 

"Fine, but know this: whatever the creature has promised you, it's lying. It will forget you at sunrise, and attack. That is its nature."

Beleazar draws himself up, his scrawny frame quivering with dignity. "People don't speak kindly of me. I know that. But I'll, er, 'deal straight' with you. And I pay well."</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>For a moment, Beleazar seems torn. Then, he chuckles to hide his nervousness.

Beleazar rubs the back of his hand across his mouth. "Tell them you wish to see the beast, and plant the device when they're not watching. And if you get caught, don't tell them I sent you."

      <DefaultText>"I'm... I'm not sure," Beleazar admits, mouth twisting. "My former colleague found it within the rusted casing of a war machine. I say 'former' because when he activated it, he disappeared. We found his remains, er, spread across the Reef, as if he was hurled at the ground with great force." He looks briefly nauseous at the memory. 

"Now, you might be thinking the nychthemeron will perish in the same manner, and it *might*, but I wouldn't count on it. The creature can *float*."</DefaultText>

"I can't wait to get this back to my lab!" he says, his eyes shining with a child's raw exhilaration. "Look at it. Coated in nano-spirit fluid! Bound with *three* data locks! It's like a puzzle that no one gets to solve but me!"

And with that, he scampers away.

      <DefaultText>"It's my fault," Beleazar says, hanging his head. "I tried so *hard* to avoid their suspicion that I suspect I drew it instead. Perhaps I'm better suited to indoor study after all."

He pulls a number of shins from his belt and hands them to you. "For your trouble," he says, and trudges away.

      <DefaultText>You hold up the notes El-Jinto gave you, and Beleazar snatches them from your hands. His eyes widen as he soaks in the information. 

"This is more than I expected to learn on my own," Beleazar says at last, cheeks flushed. "They gave this to you because you told them I was interested? All that time spent in *subterfuge*, and I could have just asked? Thank you. Thank you for everything."

He hands you your reward, then wanders away, flipping through the pages.
