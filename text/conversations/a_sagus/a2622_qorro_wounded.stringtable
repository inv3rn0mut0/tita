      <DefaultText>The corpses of murdens - hunched, birdlike abhumans - litter the floor. Their wounds are fresh, left by blade and beam. The air smells of rust and blood. 

Qorro awaits you on the other end of the room with a hireling. He's clutching his bandaged side with a shaking hand. Even now, he manages a cocky grin.  

"Took you long enough," he says.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Qorro is still here, hand clenched to his wound.

"Well. You made it back. I expect murderous drones were no match for you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We made a slight miscalculation in assuming the murdens here were the architects of Salimeri's troubles."

He coughs and continues. "After we punished them for trespassing, we descended to the next level to look for stragglers. But instead, we found what drove the murdens up here - heavily-armed and hostile drones." His hand tightens on his side. 

"As you can see, we had a rough time of it. We left two dead down there." His face is solemn. "I should have been more careful."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In your case," Callistege says. "Practically everything, I'm afraid."

With a pained chuckle, Qorro turns back to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And Cal!" he says to your companion, his grin half a grimace. "I was hoping you'd make your appearance earlier. What kept you? Following our falling star around the city?"

He sighs. "What could have possibly been more important than lending an old friend a hand?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can't deny it," he says. "It's a shame that my team had to suffer for the sake of my lesson." 

He smiles, but his heart isn't in it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"These?" he says, eyebrows climbing in surprise. "They're nothing I can't treat myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now, if you still intend on reclaiming this place for Salimeri, the drones are still down there. I *believe* they're infecting the systems with their minds. And they will defend their territory without mercy. Believe me."

He turns his attention back to his wounds. "Good luck."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not at all. I expected more of a challenge after what they did to you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I barely beat them. How did you survive?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, but I'm far more fragile and mortal than you," he says bitterly. "I depend on luck and dead friends, it seems."

He looks away. "Never mind that. I have a favor to ask." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, luck and a handful of dead friends," he says bitterly, looking away. "But never mind that. I have a favor to ask."

      <DefaultText>"Of course not," Qorro says bitterly, looking away. "But never mind that. I have a favor to ask."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tell Salimeri I helped you. I did, after all. These murdens would have attacked you. I killed them first. We even destroyed a few of the drones before we fled."

He meets your eyes again. "She wants to dismiss me. Help me change her mind, and I'll tell you something I know about the Order of Truth."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'll tell her you helped."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A good employer's hard to find, these days," he says, studying the air above your head.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I deserve more than secrets for doing your dirty work."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fine," Qorro says without hesitation. "I'll give you something from my private collection, but only after you tell her. Will you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Excellent. I'll hold you to that. Now, the secret, as promised." He winces, hand moving to his side. 

"Lan Uring," he says. "The boy is a spy for the Memovira. I'm not sure why - he loves the Order well enough. I was going to blackmail him, but..." 

He grins. "Priorities change, I suppose. I'll see you back at the Order, falling star."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But not impossible. Tell the truth, Qorro. Why do you care about her opinion so much?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All right."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Her opinion?" He laughs nervously. "No, I..." he trails off under your stare. 

"Fine," he says. "I love her. There, I've said it. And I don't want to leave her side, even if she doesn't feel the same way."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Her opinion?" He laughs nervously. "No. Her pay? Absolutely. Drinks can be found for free, but they're hardly ever worth the price."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tybir palms his face. 

"Oh, for the love of... I know at least thirty shape-shifters who charge *reasonable* hourly rates," he says. "And that's just off the top of my head. You don't need to stumble after a woman who has no interest in you. Have some pride, son."

      <DefaultText>"Oh, Qorro," she sighs. "She is utterly beyond your reach, my dear."

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh," Rhin says. "I think it's worse than that. She, um, doesn't seem to like you very much. At all."
{RHIN}</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course she is," Qorro says sharply. "That doesn't change a thing."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Pride," says Qorro, "is like free liquor. Hardly ever worth the cost."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That may be putting it too lightly, sweetness."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I saw the way you looked at her. And me, when you learned she... knew me. You love her, don't you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyes widen. Then his mouth firms. 

"Fine," he says. "I love her. There, I've said it. And I don't want to leave her side, even if she doesn't feel the same way."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I expected as much," Qorro says with a heavy sigh. "Give Salimeri my... my regards."

And without another word, he leaves.</DefaultText>
