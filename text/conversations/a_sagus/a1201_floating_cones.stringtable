      <DefaultText>Two floating cones whirl and spin deliriously around each other, giggling like children being tickled. The air around them smells of sweet, burning leaves. 

{SOUND: We should hear the giggling sounds throughout this dialogue, though we should also hear them outside the dialogue when we approach the cones. Alex, I'm not sure how you want to handle this.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You manage to graze one of them with the tip of your finger. "Rorn," a voice says, and your vision is stolen from you. 

A moon hangs over you, but it is not the one you recognize. It's black and in a pearl-white sky. Thick, flat asteroids orbit it like petals in the wind. You feel questing tendrils at your ankle, and the hot wind on your face smells of scorched hair and grief.

      <DefaultText>The cones greet your question with a split second of hushed silence, following by delighted peals of helpless giggling. 

{SOUND: As noted in the text, the giggling should stop of a second, then resume (maybe a little more hysterical at first).}</DefaultText>
