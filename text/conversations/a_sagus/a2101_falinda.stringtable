      <DefaultText>Nearly every inch of this merchant's body is covered in tightly-wound robes and furs. A hood obscures its head, and a mask conceals its face. 

This doesn't stop you from noticing that it is apparently *furious* with you. Trembling, it bats at its similarly dressed companion. Both of them turn impassive masks back to you.  
{GEORGE: I think these characters' people might be responsible for the Words of Qra. You'll see what I mean. Either that, or (as Colin suggested) they can have some reactivity to that content. Colin recommended a [B]-priority connection.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Neither Falinda nor Steristi could believe it, but the thief had come back. Had he come in shame, ready to return what he had taken? No. His hands were empty, his expression *baffled*." 

Falinda crosses swaddled arms. "Perhaps the thief had simply forgotten to return what he had borrowed. But this made him no less a thief."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Falinda snatched the book from the thief's hands," the merchant says, doing so. "And yes, it was the same book. Still sealed. Still worthless. Still priceless."

The merchant traces the sigil on the cover for a long, silent moment. "As a reward, Falinda invited the thief... the *customer* to take - yes, take - one of the merchant's more *ragged* books as payment. Stock space was limited, after all, and the customer would be doing Falinda and Steristi a favor."

Steristi pointedly returns to work, ignoring you both. Falinda sighs, massaging its temples with gloved hands. "But in the end, Falinda took a deep, *deep* breath, and asked the thief to simply return the sealed and long overdue book with the five-colored sigil on its cover."</DefaultText>

"This frustrated Falinda. After all, the two merchants were creatures of words, bound in metal and cloth, but whenever Falinda tried to bend these same words into explanations and answers, they crumbled and fell apart. They could not fold themselves around the truth."

The merchant slams a final book into place. "And so, Falinda said nothing."</DefaultText>

"I wrote this book," you grumble. "I-I don't remember what's *in* it, but it's mine. I don't want to borrow it. I want it *back*."

"And yet, the customer knew that a book, once lost, belongs to everyone," Falinda says smoothly. "And as such, the customer would settle for borrowing the book. For a little while."</DefaultText>
