      <DefaultText>He notices you, brightens, and exhales in a rush. 

"I was about to jump off the cliff and swim to the bottom of that sea. I figured I could trap air in different parts of my mouth before it faded away. Squish it together, you know?"</DefaultText>

He waggles his finger at you. "I think you've been worrying too much while I've been resting. Let's have some more adventures. What do you say?"</DefaultText>
