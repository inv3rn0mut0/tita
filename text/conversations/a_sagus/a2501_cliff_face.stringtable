      <DefaultText>A sheer cliff rises above the ledge. Its surface is rough and jagged. There are enough handholds that it looks climbable, but it wouldn't be easy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cliff face is deceptive. Holds that look like they'll crumble in your hands stay firm, while solid-looking protrusions crumble like they were made of sand. With careful planning, though, you make it all the way to the top.

{SOUND: PC climbing, maybe a little extra wind whipping by him.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The climb feels easy. You're halfway up when suddenly both of your footholds crumble simultaneously. You grab a jutting rock in panic, but it snaps away. You land with a sickening *thwack* onto the ledge below.

It could've been worse. On the plus side, you think you've figured out how to read the cliff to find better footholds.

{SOUND: PC climbing, then rocks crumbling and the impact of hitting the ledge a few meters below.}

      <DefaultText>Your rope makes the climb easy. It's as if the rope can tell which handholds are most solid, and it bites into those as though it had teeth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A welcome blast of wind caresses your face at the cliff top.

{SOUND: If there was wind SFX from node 5, then they should change here to be more open since the PC has reached the top.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Again, the climb feels easy until your handhold slips, knocking you off-balance. You crack your head on the ledge yet again. At least it wasn't as bad as the first time.

{SOUND: PC climbing, then rocks crumbling and the impact of hitting the ledge a few meters below. Same sound as node 6.}

      <DefaultText>The sheer cliff looks more frightening from above than it did from below. The ledge at the bottom looks miniscule, dwarfed by the immensity of the ocean, which lies a thousand meters straight down.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It takes enormous effort not to look down. You manage to scale the cliff one hold at a time. Before you know it, you've reached the ledge.</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>You lower yourself over the edge and begin the steep climb. As you look to see how much farther you have to go, a sense of vertigo suddenly overwhelms you. The ocean and the ledge beneath sway back and forth. Before you know it, your hand has slipped from its hold...</DefaultText>
