      <DefaultText>"I'm a merc. Head of the Ianthine Specter Company. What brings you to the Thicket?"

He sees something in your expression. "First timer, huh? Well, whatever we talk about here can't be overheard. Someone tries to read our lips, they get gibberish."

He crosses his arms. "Good place to talk business, in other words. If that's what you're here for."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This slim man looks to be in good shape, and though his face remains hidden within his hood, he carries himself with confidence. 

His clothing exudes something like smoke that makes him look a bit like a ghost - perhaps a man who can't be found if he doesn't want to be.

"Irathor Brenn," he states. "Pleasure."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We do infiltration mostly," he says with a smoothness that implies he's given this speech before. "Sabotage, assassinations, assorted hostile recovery. Sometimes the city hires us to handle local threats - problematic tribes, roaming predators, you name it."

He chuckles. "Pretty quiet these days. Not like when we got started. Our first big job was a series of assaults in the Endless Battle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can't say," he says automatically. "Contracts. You understand. All I can tell you is the Chalcedon pays on time, and that's more than I can say for some of the employers I've had over the years."

      <DefaultText>Irathor stares you down. Something tickles the back of your mind.

"All right," he says, wincing. "But it's not like me to forget a face, especially when it belongs to a castoff. You lot are either hiring my people or trying to kill them most of the time."

He shrugs. "It'll come to me at midnight, probably. Right in the middle of a good dream. And I won't forget your face again. That's a promise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Negotiations," he says shortly. "I'm between meetings with a few Council representatives. They may want us for some, uh, ongoing work." He shows his teeth. "Bit of a bidding war going on right now, to be honest. We're in demand."</DefaultText>

"Can we trust them?" you hear yourself say, your voice muted by the years. 

"They're mercenaries," your companion replies. "Of course we can't."

      <DefaultText>"Really?" he says, cocking an eyebrow. "All right. It's basically like it sounds - a fight that's given people like me a solid payday for more generations than anyone could count."

He shrugs. "As far as I heard, it's a scrap between rival factions of the Changing God's castoffs. What about, I couldn't tell you." He cracks a grin. "Getting interested in the 'why' of a war always ends up being bad for business."</DefaultText>
