He shudders under your touch, but then the pain in his eyes clears and he stands taller, though you feel weak and considerably diminished.

You stagger back. He blinks and looks around, wiping his eyes, then sees the blood on his hands. "What... what just happened? Why am I crying? Where did this blood come from?"

      <DefaultText>The feeling of compassion expands within you, and you mold it with your will, making it into a healing balm. You put a hand on Zebb's forehead and a stream of warmth flows though you into his mind, building up certain memories and diminishing others and washing others entirely away. He shudders under your touch, but then the pain in his eyes clears and he stands taller, though you feel weak and considerably diminished.
