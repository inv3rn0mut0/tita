      <DefaultText>Pacing the edges of the crowd is a paunchy old soldier with a swaggering stride. At the moment, however, his jauntiness seems overshadowed by worry, and he alternates between watching the execution and searching the crowd as if looking for a miracle. Then his eyes light on you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't need anything. But my friend there on the platform is dying. The nightmares his executioners have induced in him spill from him with every word he speaks, and wrap around him like a snake."

He glances at the execution. "I know there are but a few strands around him now, but in a few days' time, they'll choke the life out of him. I cannot imagine a more horrible way to die."

He pauses. "Well, that's not true. I have an imagination that would shame a sailor." </DefaultText>

He glances at the execution. "Already the coils grow thick. In another day... maybe two... they'll choke the life out of him. I cannot imagine a more horrible way to die."

He pauses. "Well, that's not true. I have an imagination that would shame a sailor."</DefaultText>

He glances at the execution. "For three days the coils have wrapped around him, tighter and tighter. Today they will choke the life out of him. I cannot imagine a more horrible way to die."

      <DefaultText>The old soldier is still pacing the edge of the crowd, anxious. He brightens when he sees you. "Ah! You've returned. Have you changed your mind, my friend? Are you here to help?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you pass a stack of cargo, a familiar figure steps out from behind it, disguised - entirely unconvincingly - as an Aeon Priest. "Er, hello again, lad," says Tybir. "I... I don't suppose you're ready to change your mind about me joining you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The place of execution is empty but for the old soldier. He glares at you. "You dare show your face now? You've killed him, understand? Whether it was laziness or forgetfulness or spite, you've come too late. Ris is dead."

His hand closes into a shaking fist. "I can't stay in this city another minute, knowing that he died here because I trusted a stranger."

He spits at your feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He leans in. "You'll need to be swift, and willing to hold justice above law, but there is a way to save him, if you will hear me out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You are a miracle, my friend! Here, let me have that. I'll copy it out and add Ris's name."

He takes the document from you, sets it by a blank sheet, and laboriously but very neatly copies it word for word, except for the name of the condemned. That he changes to Ris, then he signs it and gives the copy to you. </DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah, well, it seems Ris is still unhappy with me for leaving him on the gibbet for so long, and he wants to strangle me with my own entrails to show me how it felt. I, naturally, am less enthusiastic about the lesson, and would like to avoid it if at all possible."

He takes a breath - finally. "Therefore I was hoping I might join you, er, for protection, if you see what I mean. Strength in numbers and all that."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because the Council Clerk knows me now. I've been pleading Ris's case to him every day this week, but to no avail." He rolls his eyes. 

"The task requires a face he doesn't know, and hopefully, he doesn't know yours."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, not to worry. We've at least two more days before the end. But don't waste time. Every moment in the throes of that nightmare is a scar on poor Ris's soul."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Luck?" he says, shrugging. "I was taking a piss when they came for him. Went through the back window and scampered up to the roof." 

He shakes his head. "I watched poor Ris being led away from my hiding spot. Swore I'd get him free. I hope it's a promise I can keep."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When you get Col's stay of execution, I'll make a copy with Ris's name on it, and you can give it to the Overseer who will free him. You see? Simple!"

He rubs his hands together. "Now, if you'll let me join you, I'd be happy to show you around the city and help you with all this - and whatever else you have going. What do you say?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Suit yourself, but don't waste time. Ris hasn't much left. Bring the document to me when you have it. Any other questions before you go?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>

      <DefaultText>"A misunderstanding," he says, waving a dismissive hand. "Ris and I were hired to deliver some expensive brandy to an out-of-town buyer."

He breathes a sigh, weighted with disgust and regret. "Would you believe that the bottles were *stuffed* with state secrets? Ris was accused of selling information to the enemies of Sagus Cliffs. They called him a traitor!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A simple one, but it requires nerve. Listen." 

He lowers his voice. "It would be nothing for someone of your noble demeanor to masquerade as a city official and ask the Council Clerk for an archived copy of an old stay of execution. Once you have it, I'll write out a fresh one and add Ris's name. Then we'll present it to the overseer here, and poor Ris will be set free."

      <DefaultText>"Is friendship not reason enough?" he declares. Then, his shoulders sag, and he hangs his head. "Actually, truth to tell, there's more to it than that. I'm partly to blame for him being up there, and guilt's a strong motivator, eh?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>The old soldier looks anxious to leave the execution ground, but he gives you a big smile nonetheless. "There's the hero! Thank you again, my friend, for saving dear old Ris. I'm sorry you had to see that unpleasantness between us, but not to worry. He'll come around in the end."

He looks over his shoulder. "Until then, however, I think a little safety in numbers might do me good. You wouldn't perhaps be in need of a seasoned old soldier?"
