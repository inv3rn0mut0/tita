      <DefaultText>Shock and quiet awe have wiped away her usual cynicism. "What... what did you *do*? I remember Tash cutting me. I see the holes in my mind and the scars on my face. But I remember him not cutting me. I remember fighting the First's Militia, and Tash forcing me to the ground, tearing out my history..."

She shakes. "...but I saw Tash at my side, my ally..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She holds her head in her hands, shaking, her voice becoming thick. "It's pulling me apart." 

She looks up at you, tears streaming down her cheeks. "No. It's pulling me back together. I remember now. That hole is... it's almost gone."

"You changed reality. You *changed* it." She stands, drying her tears with her sleeves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I know what you want. I knew before you even came here. You were asking people about the resonance chamber, and for someone to fix it. I can think of only one of us who has the ability to mend any machine - Mazzof. You can find him in the castoff sanctuary - Miel Avest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She meets your gaze steadily. "Most of them are dead. The others I wouldn't trust. The woman who destroyed my organization wants to eliminate me. One of these days she'll get her wish. No sense in delivering myself into her hands." 

She sneers a little. "But she'd have to catch me first. I plan to frustrate her still more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A hidden fortress created by the First and our sire. It's a shielded valley, and thus many of our siblings hide from the Sorrow there, trying to figure out a way to stop the creature's attacks."

"I suppose if you're dead set on fixing that resonance chamber, you can find more answers from Mazzof there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll take you. But don't expect me to hold your hand. Probably better that I bring you personally anyway. Keep an eye on you, make sure you don't get lost... or killed."

She walks to her table, and unrolls a map of the Sagus Protectorate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She almost manages to hide the hurt on her face. "Fine. If you change your mind, I'll be here. I have work to do anyway."

She goes to her table, touches something, and the air above her desk becomes a map of the Sagus Protectorate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Miel Avest is right about here. You're not going to find it by walking to it, or even flying to it. It's shielded and hidden. That means to *everyone*. You need to find a portal in."

She points to another spot on the map. "Here. In the Valley of Dead Heroes. It's hidden in the tomb of the First. That cold-hearted bitch. Best place for her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You'll need an airship to get there. Head to the Caravanserai. Hire a vessel. You should be able to find one without too much difficulty."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Word of caution. They won't believe you in Miel Avest. They'll treat you like they treat every new castoff - as a pawn in their games with each other. Look out for that."

      <DefaultText>She points to a spot many kilometers to the north of Sagus Cliffs. "Miel Avest. Right about here. But we're not going to find it by walking to it, or even flying to it. Problem is, it's shielded to protect our kind from the Sorrow. But that means it keeps everyone else out, too. You need to find a portal in."

She points to another spot on the map. "Here. In the Valley of Dead Heroes. It's hidden in the tomb of the First. That cold-hearted bitch. Best place for her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We'll need an airship to get there. We'll take that ladder up to the caravanserai. We should be able to hire a vessel without too much difficulty."

With a glance around the cave, she says, "I won't be sad to leave this behind."</DefaultText>
