      <DefaultText>With the Labyrinth sealed, the castoffs of the Changing God returned to their lives, great and small, well aware that they lived in the Sorrow's shadow. 

True to its word, the Sorrow came for them in time, one by one, and tore them from the fabric of the world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The daughter of the Changing God set out into the world he had, without knowing, made for her. She traveled in the body that had once belonged to the Last Castoff, and with a mind forged by sacrifice.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The absence of the castoffs changed the Ninth World. Sometimes for the better, often for the worse. For the castoffs were powerful, and seats of power do not remain empty - or uncontested - for long. 

And yet, they were never seen again. Their minds dwelled on in dull, insensate darkness, trapped in a singular mind for eternity - or near enough.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Bloom held many dangers, but none that were the equal of the White Death. True to her word, Matkina took back the Bloom, and with the wisdom and experience of the castoffs to draw on, she held it for a very long time.

But nothing lasts forever.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>True to her word, the First Castoff sought - and fought - to make the world a better place. She largely avoided the mistakes of the Changing God, and she honored the sacrifices of her siblings by mending the damage they had done... and helping, whenever possible, the ones they had left behind. 

But the First was no perfect being, no goddess, and she made mistakes of her own. Mistakes that rippled out into the world, causing new havoc, new heartache - and much of it, her own. But that is another story.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Madness plagued the people of Sagus for a long time. It prowled the alleys and hollows of the place like the predator the Sorrow had been, and would be again.

For the Sorrow was not a creature so lightly slain. The castoffs carried on as they always had, bickering, fighting, and hiding, in a vast and ever-growing shadow.</DefaultText>
