      <DefaultText>After the destruction of the Memovira's Fortress, and the disappearance of the Memovira, Coty fled, alongside most of the Memovira's other soldiers. Nobody has seen him since, but it is widely believed that most of the Memovira's former soldiers were swallowed by the Bloom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Coty worked hard at the Bloom-flesh shop. He never grew quite as skilled as the Sundermuns, but he had enough skill in his own right.

Eventually, he expanded their services to woods and metals, and became sought after as a carpenter and an engraver.

Some time later, he left the Bloom to make his own way. He started a shop in Circus Minor, fashioning numenera into polished tools. He made a name for himself, in some small way.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Coty served the Observant Speck as well as he knew how, though he never quite felt comfortable working in the shrine. He was loyal and trustworthy, but when Speck told him she was passing on, and asked him to take on the mantle of Observant Speck, he refused.

He lived out the rest of his days working in the shrine, quiet and safe. And very nearly content.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Coty waited loyally for the Last Castoff to return... but he never did. After a while, the slavers started looking at him suspiciously. Afraid that they would try to sell him again, he ran.

Nobody knows where he went or what happened to him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After the Sorrow was driven out of the Memovira's fortress, Coty remained, waiting. Even after all the other soldiers fled - all except Brusca - he stayed and watched.</DefaultText>

When the First returned to the Bloom, Coty became Brusca's second-in-command. When Brusca retired a few years later, Coty was put in charge of all the Memovira's soldiers. He was cold and respected. Not a single man crossed him.</DefaultText>

When the Last Castoff returned as the new Memovira, Coty served him as well as any soldier - better even, for he knew what it was to obey without question.</DefaultText>

When Matkina returned as the new Memovira, Coty served her as well as any soldier - better even, for he knew what it was to obey without question. Matkina came to rely on him more than any other. None challenged her in all the years he served as her right-hand man.</DefaultText>

When the various factions of the Bloom rose up against each other, he and Brusca shut off the fortress. Gradually, they gathered those unaligned with any faction into the fortress, creating a kind of safe-haven... at least until a new Memovira arose.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Coty waited loyally for the Last Castoff to return. When the Fortress was destroyed, he was afraid, but still he waited.

The Last Castoff returned, and Coty found himself the servant of the new Memovira. It was a good life, he thought, even if he did still feel like a slave.</DefaultText>
