      <DefaultText>With the Last Castoff ruling the Bloom, Matkina sought another outlet for her energies and talents. She didn't know how to start shedding the mantle of the White Death.

She went to the Cult of the Changing God to ask them about her siblings. She remained with them for a year, telling them what she knew of the fate of her sire. Some of the cult quit in rage and grief. The others she led to Miel Avest. 

They built a monument to her fallen creator, and a small community accreted around her. To her surprise, she found she was a natural leader, and the town of Miel Avest began to grow. For a time, she knew peace. 

When the Sorrow came for her decades later, she greeted it as a friend.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>True to her word, Matkina assumed control of the Bloom through a lightning-fast campaign of terror and vicious assassinations, consolidating power quickly and ruthlessly.
 
Upon taking the Memovira's role, she declared a new era in the Bloom. Ever the cynic, she trusted no one. She kept her lieutenants focused on each other, and she encouraged their rivalries.

Ten years passed. The Bloom turned against her, as it had against all the previous rulers. She decided to run, and almost made it to M'ra Jolios.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the Last Castoff ruling the Bloom, Matkina sought another outlet for her talents. 

She crept out of the traumatized Sagus Cliffs, riding the worst of the aftershocks of the destruction of the Sorrow. She found herself in Miel Avest.

Other castoffs had the same idea. Together, they built a monument to their fallen creator. They tried to create a new community, none harder than Matkina, who had discovered a talent for leadership.

But castoffs are fractious and quarrelsome. One of her foes planted a singularity detonation in her bed, obliterating her.

To commemorate her efforts, the castoffs carved a remembrance in the stone walls of the valley.

That was destroyed too.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>True to her word, Matkina assumed control of the Bloom through a lightning-fast campaign of terror and vicious assassinations. She consolidated power quickly and ruthlessly, and ensured that anyone who thought to challenge her died horrifically.
 
She declared a new era in the Bloom. Ever the cynic, she trusted no one. Castoff siblings sought her favor, to use the trade routes she controlled... and she repaid them by feeding them to the Bloom. At last they left her alone.

Ten years passed. The Bloom turned against her, as it had against all the previous rulers. She decided to run. She almost made it to M'ra Jolios before a Maw opened beneath her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina returned to the Bloom, intent on claiming it for her own. But she remembered its appetite, and doubted the wisdom of her plans. Why rule a place she hated when it would eventually devour her?

Instead, she journeyed to Miel Avest, building a monument to honor her fallen siblings and her creator's intent.

Others came in time. Some were scavengers. Some thought to praise the Changing God and honor *her*. She discovered she had lost her taste for solitude, and welcomed their company. 

She helped them build, resolved their disputes with confidence and care. Spilling not a drop of blood, she became a leader.

The leader of the city of Miel Avest.   </DefaultText>

Upon taking the Memovira's role, she declared a new era in the Bloom. Ever the cynic, she trusted no one. Like her old mentor, she kept her lieutenants at each other's throats - so they wouldn't focus on her.

Ten years passed. The Bloom turned against her, as it had against all the previous rulers. She decided to run. She almost made it to M'ra Jolios.

      <DefaultText>Matkina was intent on claiming the Bloom for her own. But she remembered its appetite, and she doubted. Why rule such a place if she didn't need to protect herself against the Sorrow?

She crept out of the traumatized Sagus Cliffs, and made her way to Miel Avest. Other castoffs had the same idea. They tried to create a new community, and Matkina played peacekeeper for them.

But castoffs are fractious and bloody-minded in their arguments, and Matkina had had her fill of death. After ten years, she left her home.

Some of her siblings pursued her, hoping to gain the benefit of her hard-won wisdom. The only evidence of her passing was a fresh Maw on the road to M'ra Jolios.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina returned to the Bloom, intent on claiming it for her own. But she remembered its appetite, and the example of the First. Why snatch rulership of a place she hated when it would eventually devour her?

Instead, she returned to Miel Avest, building a monument to honor her fallen siblings and her creator's intent. Others came in time. She discovered she had lost her taste for solitude, and welcomed their company. 

She helped them build, resolved their disputes with confidence and care. She became a leader, without a single drop of blood spilled.

Ten years passed. One morning, Matkina did not emerge from her home. Inside, a new Maw stretched wide.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina returned to the Bloom, intent on claiming it for her own. But she remembered its appetite, and she wanted to make a new start, to cast aside the mantle of the White Death. 

She journeyed instead to Miel Avest. Other castoffs came in time, though none congregated for long - the threat of the Sorrow was too great. Ordinary humans came too, and Matkina discovered she had lost her taste for solitude. She welcomed their company.

She is happy now.</DefaultText>
