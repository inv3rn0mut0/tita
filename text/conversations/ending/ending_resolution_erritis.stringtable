      <DefaultText>Erritis set off on his own, blazing as bright as any comet. And yet, the cloud of nano-demons had not exaggerated the cost of their hero's increased power. Soon, Erritis was limping. Then, crawling. 

A week later, a traveler found an unremarkable, straw-haired stranger lying dead in the road. He did not have a single wound. A single golden fleck marked the corner of his mouth. 

Light-footed bootprints - the corpse's feet were clean and bare, the traveler noticed, wound away down the road. In the direction of the sunrise. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Erritis set off on his own, driven by the competing urges of the nano-demons, but also by the lessons the Last Castoff had taught him. He spent his life - what little there was left of it - helping people as best as he could, whether they wanted it or not. 

But what mattered was that he tried. That in some rare cases, he found someone who *actually* needed help, and saved them as a hero does: just in time. 

Eventually, his exertions took their toll. He fell ill on the road, then collapsed. Erritis died miles from anywhere, alone, but with a satisfied smile on his face. 

The voices within him went dormant. Quiet. Waiting for the next Hero to come along.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Erritis set off on his own, driven by the competing urges of the voices in his head. Hungry for the grand quest would define his life and etch his story into the heavens, he chased rumors in circles, got lost in deserts, and scaled mountains. He explored ruins, claimed artifacts, climbed and fell and swam and ran... and...

Collapsed. Months and months of unending adventure had taken their toll on the Hero. Erritis died in a nameless field not far from where he had begun his mad and frantic quest. And the voices within him went dormant. Quiet. 

Waiting for the next Hero to come along.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hero Erritis was never seen again. 

But in a nameless field not far from the Valley of Dead Heroes, an aging herdsman drove his newly-bought yol towards a run-down hut. Humming to himself, he rebuilt the hut stone by stone. That night, he slept better than he had in years. 

He lived out his many years as a stranger to everyone who saw him in the tiny town where he bought his supplies. And one day, a shopkeeper realized he hadn't seen the herdsman in months. 

That was the last time anyone thought of the man Erritis had become. </DefaultText>
