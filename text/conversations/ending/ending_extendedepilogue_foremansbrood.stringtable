      <DefaultText>Although the crippled construct eventually agreed to give up trying to procreate, Tarnish could hear the torment in the foreman's voice.

      <DefaultText>The tiny construct children of the crippled foreman scattered throughout the city. They began building things at random - much to the consternation of the master foreman.
