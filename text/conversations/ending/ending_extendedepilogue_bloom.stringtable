      <DefaultText>The Bloom was relatively quiet for days after the Sorrow's attack on the Memovira's Fortress. Nearly all of the Memovira's soldiers had fled, and the rest of the Bloom's denizens waited quietly, wondering what would happen.

When the Memovira did not return, and nobody rose up to take her place... that's when the fighting began. It started with the mutants of Little Nihliesh, but soon every faction was involved. The Bloom became a deadly battleground - one the Bloom itself seemed to encourage, engorging itself on the lust of its denizens.

Brusca harbored a small contingent of civilians inside the fortress, hoping that the violence would die down.

They are still there, hoping.</DefaultText>
