      <DefaultText>With the sticha's eggs safely in the care of the city, the quakes beneath Sagus Cliffs ceased for many years. Indeed, it had been so long that Peliai often considered selling the rest of the eggs for herself.

One night, the inhabitants of Government Square were woken by a thunderous crash that shook even the strongest buildings. Bleary-eyed, they came out of their homes to see what had happened.

Peliai's home was gone, and Peliai with it. In its place was an enormous sinkhole that seemed to stretch down beneath the level of the ocean itself.

Nobody ever climbed down to see what became of her, but the city has been silent ever since.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The quakes beneath Sagus Cliffs ceased for many years, despite Peliai's concerns that without leverage over them, the sticha would return some day. She would stand in the square most days, preaching her fear to whoever would listen.

One day, Peliai announced that she had evidence the sticha had returned. She called for a group of brave souls to follow her beneath the city, to stop them before it was too late.

Several of her bravest listeners followed her into the dark. Nobody knows what has become of them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sticha traveled long and far to reach their new home. Many died along the way, the rocks between Sagus and the new rock providing very little in the way of sustenance for them.

But they reached it in the end, and forged a new home for themselves. They flourished there for a long time.</DefaultText>

Until the quakes began again...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The quakes continued. One by one, most of the houses in Cliff's Edge fell into the sea, and the people of Sagus grew more and more afraid.

In a last desperate move, Peliai called for a group of brave souls to follow her beneath the city, to stop the sticha before it was too late. Dozens of brave men and women answered, following her into the dark.

They were never seen again. Nobody knows what became of them, but the quakes *did* stop a short time later.</DefaultText>
