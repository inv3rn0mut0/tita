      <DefaultText>The chiurgeon made Piquo stronger, as advertised. Despite his loathing of the Underbelly, he eventually returned there and became one of Fulsome's enforcers. He didn't have a family, but he had *respect*, and to him that was just as good.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Piquo's new looks enabled him to attain better jobs in the higher tiers of Sagus Cliffs. Eventually, he landed a job working for Tranquility's hostel in Caravanserai.

She tells anyone who will listen the good work he does, and he's easy on the eyes to boot. Piquo hopes one day to take over the place, but Tranquility has other plans for him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>What began as one or two drinks turned into four then five. Soon it became a habit. Piquo would go to the bar every night, sometimes even paying a girl to stay with him, if he had the money for one. So long as he had the money to pay, people treated him well there. And when he didn't, he would work hard for more.

He never made anything of himself, but he lived his life and even got the respect he wanted, in a way.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As it turned out, Piquo excelled in the Order of Truth. He read everything anybody would give him, tried everything anybody would let him try. In a few short years, he was well-versed in all manner of numenera. He became an Aeon Priest in less than a decade.

Now he is vying for Min's position as head of the Order. Min is not putting up much of a fight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As a cultist, Piquo learned much about the Changing God and his offspring - about the man who originally set him on his path. He found inconsistencies, however, between what he saw in the histories and what the cultists told him, but he was afraid to bring them up for fear of being ostracized.

After years of study, he decided that the Changing God was *not* in fact an inspiration, but a man only interested in himself and his own immortality. He is now wondering what other jobs his time as a cultist might have suited him for. If any.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After Qeek's murder, Piquo went back to the chiurgeon and slapped his bag of shins on the counter. He wanted to become stronger. He couldn't be there for Qeek.

He would never let that happen again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Piquo and Qeek spent a long life together. Eventually, Piquo convinced Qeek there were better jobs on the streets above. They had it hard, but they always had each other.

They eventually married and left the Sagus Protectorate in search of a quieter life.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Piquo waited for the Last Castoff to return for several days, until he figured out that he'd been swindled. Heartbroken and disillusioned, he went back to scrimping shins at whatever job he could.

Some day, he would go back to the chiurgeon. He would make his *own* decision, not letting anyone else tell him what to do with his life.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Piquo waffled and wavered outside the chiurgeon's parlor for days. Finally, a well-dressed man approached him offering to change his life for the better for just a few shins. Piquo gladly paid.

The man came back day after day, each time with a gift, a new promise, and a new request for money. Piquo ran out of the rest of his money within a week, and he never saw the man again. His life never did change for the better.</DefaultText>
