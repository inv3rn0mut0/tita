      <DefaultText>Aligern returned to Ormen with the frame that had brought him so much grief. One by one, he pulled his tattoos free and cast them through the black metal portal. His friends emerged on the other side, dazed and shocked by their long years of imprisonment in Aligern's mind and body.

He saved his wife and daughter for last, hoping without hope that they would be unharmed.

They suffered no lasting damage.

Over his remaining years, Aligern learned to understand the frame and its function. Ormen became a nomadic village, carried on the body of a solitary traveler.

Its people flourished, and none forgot the name of the man who showed them the new way: Aligern.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aligern sought out psychics outside the city of Sagus Cliffs. They taught him to unlock the secret code that would free his people.

      <DefaultText>Aligern returned to the Bloom, seeking the metal frame that Orth Faung had requested. He found it at last, and his colleague told him the truth - the tattoos that Aligern had regarded as a curse were the transformed villagers of Ormen, their data carried in biological light and transplanted into his skin.

Aligern discovered how he might free his family and friends from the cursed tattoos. Some of the villagers suffered permanent damage, and Aligern devoted his remaining days to caring for those he had harmed. He refused to deal with the numenera again.

He was buried in Ormen. They scratched his name on the wall of the Valley of Dead Heroes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aligern sought his friend Orth, but never found him. In despair, he journeyed west, through Augur Kala and into the Steadfast. None could provide him the answers he sought, and he became a dead-eyed mercenary, hurling his living tattoos with abandon.

He was a haunted man. He never knew what became of his family, and he never stopped looking. On the day of his death, the tattoos he bore screamed aloud and disappeared.</DefaultText>
