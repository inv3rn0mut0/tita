      <DefaultText>A distant howling fills your ears, louder with each passing second. You can feel hands grasping and tearing at the membrane that protects you. Darkness fills your mind, and an aching cold begins to set in your bones. You realize that your eyes are closed, and they open sluggishly at your command.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A white-pink, fleshy envelope surrounds you. Even as you look, you see it begin to tear, and the howling wind forces its way inside. The cocoon rips away, spinning you into a dizzying tumble. You catch a glimpse of a curved horizon, and the ground beneath you that is approaching deceptively quickly. Above you, you see a small moon collapsing in upon itself, a corona of acid green and black energy playing around its edges.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are spinning too rapidly to get a good look. You *can* make out a singular landmass, a vast body of water, and scattered archipelagos, but the detail eludes you. A deep black night is above you, its nocturnal clarity disappearing as the haze of atmosphere envelopes you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Instinctively you spread your arms and legs, and you stop tumbling head over heels. Though you are still spinning laterally, that motion has calmed as well, and you have space to assess your situation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Below you, you see a single large landmass, an enormous piece of land that stretches across the face of the world. A massive ocean dominates the rest of the globe, dotted here and there with island chains. To your left and right, you see small moons, unusual structures, and strange machines in glittering profusion rush past as you plummet toward the ground.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Now you see that this appears to be a huge mega-continent, the only land of any size (on this side of the world at least). Great inland seas and lakes dot the land, and curiously regular mountain ranges march up and down and across the land. You are falling toward what looks to be a wooded area, with glints of water sparkling amongst the trees. A sprawling city lies to the east of your likely landing, on the western shore of a great sea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>To the south and east, you see a broad plain, scattered with curious structures visible even from this height. The southwestern portion of this land looks to be a desert, a strange blue dot in its exact center. To the east of that are a ring of huge mountains, surmounted by enormous carved heads spewing magma from their mouths into a central catch-basin. But what concerns you most right now is the ground. It's coming at you awfully fast.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Working feverishly, you try to weave the shreds of your protective cocoon together to create some sort of air resistance - and how do you even know how to do such a thing? You don't remember *anything* - but the fabric is tearing and crumbling, drying out in the rapid descent. The wind is screaming in your ears.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're wearing a form-fitting suit, dark, and you seem to recall that you were wearing something much more elaborate a short time ago. You have smooth, light brown skin, five fingers on each hand, five toes on each foot. Good muscles - strong, but not bulky. Your palms are soft, as if they have not done much labor, but scars and burns on the hands and wrists suggest that you haven't always been careful. Why can't you remember this, though?

Without warning, the cocoon that surrounds you shreds and tears away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's... it's hazy. You were in a tall passageway, its side slicked with dew, the air warm and moist, as if you were caught in the breath of a giant organism. You remember fear and exhilaration, laughing through the terror. What was it that pursued you?</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>Something ancient and cold, its coiling power the promise of oblivion. Its shadowed tendrils struck at you, and the walls where they landed were torn apart utterly, destroyed beyond any hope of repair. You leapt into a pod and fell from the... the moon?... and then you were empty. But who were you? What was that creature? A word surfaces in your thoughts, and you seize it before it vanishes: Sorrow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You push your arms to your sides, and the monstrous wind tosses your feet above your head.

      <DefaultText>There's a pathway made of floating stone that crosses the lake from the east, leading directly to the glassine structure that also floats above the lake, in apparent defiance of gravity. 

You see two people standing outside the building. One of them, strangely blurred, looks up at you and points, her other hands - hands? - grasping the sleeve of her companion.</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks at you and extends his right arm toward you, and a tangle of jagged lines and multicolor leaps from his hand, enfolding you.  

Your speed slows tremendously, but it is not enough. You strike the crystalline structure with a massive crunch, pain exploding through your body even as you hear the squeal of a sudden energy surge from the underside of the building.

      <DefaultText>You angle your arms and cup your hands, but the wind batters you and you lose control of your fall, and begin to tumble again. You have no idea where you're aimed.

A mass of colors surrounds you, and the sound of roaring wind diminishes noticeably. But it is not enough, and there is a sickening crack as you strike something, the howl of a sudden energy surge, and then... </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From what you can see of your outstretched figure, you're wearing a body-hugging suit of some sort. Your skin is light brown, and you seem to have five fingers on each hand. You can feel a good set of muscles helping control your fall - not bulky, but well-toned - but you can't examine yourself too closely without losing the little stability you've gained in the fall. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pull your hands in for a closer look as the air once again takes hold of you. Your hands are soft but scarred: they were not used for manual labor, but they've clear seen some hard use. You have fresh wounds, as if from acid, and when you run your hands over your hair, you hiss in pain as you find a burnt and bubbled portion of your scalp.

The ground is getting closer at an alarming rate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You have just enough time to see that you are rushing at a glassine structure that seems to hover above a lake, that there is a figure who is pointing at you with a jumble of colors pouring from his arms to surround you, and that you are...

... smashing into the building. The squeal of a sudden energy surge rushes into your ears, and a tremendous  pain radiates from every part of your body. And then... </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You close your eyes and remember walking through a hall of breathing greenery, a feeling of fear and exhilaration, and...

      <DefaultText>You flap your arms. You grasp them. You concentrate hard on not falling. Nothing happens.

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>For one thing, it's coming at you very quickly. Directly below you, there's a perfectly circular lake with a small structure in the middle of it. This lake is in the middle of a strange forest, and to the east, beyond the wood's borders, you can see the signs of civilization - but whether encroaching or receding, you cannot say. The smoke of a city rises from that direction as well, and  you can see flying shapes on the horizon. To your south, the forest stretches for kilometers, and beyond that a sudden golden waste. 

You have no time for further observation; the earth is snatching at you too greedily.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are entirely unsuccessful in this. The pull of the earth is too strong, your leverage non-existent. Nothing happens.

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>Why not? It doesn't appear you can do anything else right now. You close your eyes and recall, over the wind roaring in your eyes:

You were being hunted. The feeling of violation in a place that should been a sanctuary. Your memory is of a shadowy figure of acid and hate, something that sought to destroy you utterly... but the emotions attached to this "you" are not yours, the feelings those of a spectator. But who was it who ran with your legs, whose adrenaline poured through your veins?</DefaultText>

      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>You remember reaching an escape tube, and you remember being struck by one of the creature's questing pseudopods, and then the fall - 

 - the fall! You open your eyes in time to see a riot of color around you, your descent barely slowed, and then agony flares throughout your body as a crunching impact destroys you. The last thing you hear is a rapidly cycling whine of energy, and then... </DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>Probably the best choice. You don't seem to have any other option. You close your eyes to the world below you, ignore the rushing of the wind past you, and *concentrate*.

You remember that you were in the hallways of a place that was a part of you. But wait... it wasn't you. You look at these memories as if they were projected in your mind, not as if they were a part of you. Yet it was your body that walked those halls, your lungs that breathed that air...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If you somehow manage to sidestep everything you know about anatomy, physics, and death - and you are surprised to realize that you *do* know something about them - and you survive this fall, you suspect that you might be able to reawaken that dormant strength.

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>But wait! You plummet toward a structure of glass, hovering over a lake, and a strangely blurred woman and a man are pointing at you. A mass of colors rushes from his outstretched arm, enfolding you.

But it's too late. You were falling too fast. With a sickening thump, you destroy the glass structure. You hear some strange engine howl as its balance is forever altered, and then... </DefaultText>

      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>A broad forest stretches beneath you, and to the east you can see the edges of civilization. Smoke from a great city rises further that way. To the south, you can barely see the edges of a gold-glinting desert. Below you, a lake rushes at you with dismaying velocity. In the middle of this lake, a glassy structure seems to hover above the water, and on the platform that surrounds it, two figures point at your blazing descent. One throws out a dusky arm and colors surround you, slowing your fall.</DefaultText>

      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>But it is not enough. You crash into the crystalline structure with a profound and horrific crunch, pain radiating through every inch of your body, and the squeal of tortured machinery echoes simultaneously through your ears. And then...

      <ID>82</ID>
      <DefaultText>As the water rushes at you horrifyingly quickly, you see a pair of figures standing near a small glassine building. You're headed straight for it! One of them looks up, points at you, and you feel your speed slow tremendously... but you are still traveling too fast, and both the figures leap aside as you crash into the crystalline structure with a profound and horrific crunch, pain radiating through every inch of your body.

And then...</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>83</ID>
      <DefaultText>For one thing, it's coming up fast. You see a bluish smear directly below you, some sort of occlusion in the middle of that. It's an interesting composition (strange how you know the term composition... were you perhaps an artist?), made less beautiful by the certain knowledge that you're about to smear yourself across it. 

A kaleidoscope of colors erupts across your vision, and you hear the sound of wind change. You're not rushing nearly as fast as you were.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>117</ID>
      <DefaultText>It's fruitless. You've reached a velocity that could without irony best be named 'terminal'. You spread your arms and legs to try to catch a draft, and it looks like you might hit the lake that's rushing toward you... unless you hit the building that seems to be hovering above its center. 

A strange web of colors surrounds you, thrown by a figure standing on the balcony of the structure, but it is effective only at slowing your fall.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>118</ID>
      <DefaultText>However, it's fast enough. You crash into something of incredible solidity, the sound of tortured machines cycling into a rapid howl cutting briefly through the agony that fills you.

And then... </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>119</ID>
      <DefaultText>You strike the building hard enough to crack the its crystalline structure, and you hear one of the engines that supports it protest and howl, and then the agony of the crash overcomes you. And then... </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It hurts your mind to recall it, but you push past it: a creature of a forgotten world seeking you out across the centuries... but it's not you it seeks, is it? It sought the man whose memories you shuffle through now, and you realize suddenly that you are not him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a small, glassine structure hovering above a lake, two figures on its balcony. One of them points his arm at you and a riot of colors tangles your fall, slowing you...

... but not enough. You crash into the building, and as your consciousness winks out, you hear the sounds of the structure collapsing around you. And then... </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You close your eyes, and the pain of the crash is enough to spike you to the altar of wakefulness long enough to hear the sounds of some structure collapsing around you, and the agonized scream of overloaded engines cycling into madness.

      <DefaultText>You are spinning too rapidly to get a good look.You *can* make out a singular landmass, a vast body of water, and scattered archipelagos, but the detail eludes you.

      <DefaultText>It seems that once the cocoon's integrity is destroyed, it's constructed to fall to pieces. Considering how the threads crumble in your hands, you're not certain how anyone thought this might be a decent protective substance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You'd guess that you started at least 100 kilometers above the ground. At least, assuming that you started from the dying moon. You've been blacked out for some time, though - and now it looks like you're perhaps fifty kilometers up, maybe less.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wait... a curved horizon? The ground is blurry beneath you as the wind buffets you, but even without being able to see the details of the ground so far below you, you know you're in serious trouble. You will likely not survive a fall from this stratospheric height (a part of your frantic mind tells you that technically you probably fell from a thermospheric height).</DefaultText>
