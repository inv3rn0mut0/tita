      <DefaultText>As soon as you place this device in the palm of your hand, the stately dance of the clockwork planets mounted upon it becomes a frantic, spinning reel. In the heart of the thing, a contemplative hum grows, as though the machine itself were studying the path of the planets above it. 

Listening, you hear shadows of words within that sound, speaking of the mere within this device.</DefaultText>
