      <DefaultText>This deep black metal gauntlet twinkles like the stars in the night sky. A hum emanates from its surface.

When you touch the metal, images flash through your mind - too quickly for you to make sense of them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The metal it's made from is not iron or steel but something more fantastic than the metals of the Ninth World.

Otherwise, it appears to be a normal gauntlet. You notice a crust of dried blood around the inside.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The moment you slip your fingers into the glove, the gauntlet bites down on your arm. It feels like millions of razors slide up and down your arm, flaying the skin, then the muscle, then the bone. It's so bad that you pass out from the pain.

When you wake, the gauntlet lies on the ground and your hand has regrown. It seems your regenerative abilities are stronger than the gauntlet's hunger.

Even so, you feel some of the gauntlet's power in your newly regrown hand.

{SOUND: LCO screaming as the gauntlet consumes his arm.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Oddly, nothing happens when you put the gauntlet on this time. For whatever reason, it does not consume your newly grown hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You place your hand on the gauntlet again, focusing your mind on the images it gives you. They're quick - just vague impressions of the gauntlet's previous wearers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Anyone who wears the gauntlet is overwhelmed with sudden excruciating pain, as the gauntlet actually consumes the hand and takes its place. Some victims find they cannot remove the gauntlet. Others can, but when they take it off, there is nothing but a stump underneath; replacing the gauntlet over the stump causes it to reattach and function fully as the old hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You recall a story linked to a gauntlet that was involved in a string of mysterious murders. Each victim was seen sporting a single black gauntlet for a while, and then later found dead, strangled and missing a hand. A group called the God Club, or something along those lines, was mixed up with it.â€‹</DefaultText>

The gauntlet actually consumes and replaces the hand of whoever wears it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a shadow in the dark, the gauntlet holding a barbed knife in one hand then pouncing on his victim. A woman puts the gauntlet on her hand... and screams. A varjellen fights against a mob of seven, the gauntlet wielding a wicked mace - just before he dies.</DefaultText>

As you feel the Labyrinth pull you into its depths, the bloody stump at the end of your arm tingles, beginning to regrow. Just before the world goes black, you sense some of the gauntlet's power in your regenerating hand.</DefaultText>
