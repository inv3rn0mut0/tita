She doubles over as though in pain. "Mother! Father! Where are you? I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry...."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, no, no, no, no..." She shakes her head, tears flying off in every direction. "Don't hurt me. STOP HURTING ME!"

Although she seems only barely aware of you, she manages to lift a trembling finger, pointing at Tol. "I escaped," she sobs. "I escaped. I escaped..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head, but you can't tell if she's responding to you. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left. Please! Take me back!"

She forces the words out between sobs. "I didn't mean... to hurt you.... I want... family..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh. Are you sure?" She looks at the others behind you. "You look like you have enough help already. I think I would just get in the way."

      <DefaultText>The shadows begin to fade. With her eyes on you, she lowers her arms and stands straighter. She blinks three times, then looks around her in wonder.

"It's the junkyard," she says. "But... not the junkyard. Where are we?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>She leaps forward and wraps her arms around your waist. "Thank you. Again."

She squeezes you tightly one more time and steps back, wiping the last tear from her face. "So what now?"</DefaultText>
