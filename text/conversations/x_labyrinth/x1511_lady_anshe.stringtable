"The name's Anshe," she says. "Lady Anshe, but don't let that scare you off. We didn't get a chance to talk much in Miel Avest, so I'll give you the pitch - I sell rare numenera and a place to rest at a fair price, offer beds. I can also upgrade your friends' equipment, but that's a bit more expensive."
