      <DefaultText>Erritis stands, fists clenched and knuckles white, at the center of his aura - his golden cloud. It takes you a moment to realize what's different here.

He is in a hollow place within the glow, though it is reaching for him with hooked tendrils and jagged spines.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For some reason, Erritis is holding his aura at bay. You can't help noticing that he looks older than he did before, and exhausted as well. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at you. His eyes are heavy with bewildered hurt. 

"You know," he said. "You know what's happening. You gave me to them, and I can't fight any more-"

His hands fall, and the aura closes on him like spilling water, drowning him under it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can hold them back," he says hoarsely. "They aren't *in* me here. I can leave them behind if I try. If I'm strong enough! If I..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"LET US IN," roar the Paragons. "WE HAD A BARGAIN, ERRITIS. YOU CAN'T GO BACK ON IT JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T AGREE TO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He trails off, desperately searching your eyes for something... something that isn't there. You never have a chance to ask what it was.

He sags, surrendering, lowering his head, and the aura closes on him like spilling water, drowning him under it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You fall silent, watching the golden wave reclaim the *real* Erritis. </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>Twitching lightly, the hero straightens. His hair is flowing gold and sparks dance between his fingertips. His eyes are wide and glazed with wonder...

...and in them, just for an instant, you see the man Erritis *was* alight, and burning.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your voice echoes, and the Audience recoils at the sound. Erritis's space within the aura grows. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Erritis flinches, as if your words hurt him. And perhaps they did, for he sags, surrendering, lowering his head, and the aura closes on him like spilling water, drowning him under it.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>Twitching lightly, the hero straightens. His hair is shining once more, and his skin is young again. He gives you a wide, welcoming grin.

"Where have *you* been? Never mind. Don't answer that. I'm terrible at listening to answers!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>Following the wordless urges of your instincts, you plunge your hands into the golden cloud. Bloody, crisscrossing lines race over your knuckles and up your arms, but the Audience has no taste for you. You can sense its horror and disgust at being touched like this. 

With a grunt, you tear the cloud away from your companion. The Audience screams as one. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>You hesitate a moment too long. Wincing, Erritis falters, and the golden flood closes over him, swallowing him whole. 

Twitching lightly, the hero straightens. His hair is shining once more, and his skin is young again, but for a moment... his eyes meet yours, and are filled with gratitude for what you tried to do. 

Even if you failed.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>You turn back to Erritis. He is transparent. Fading. He is no longer a hero, a fighter, or a champion. What he is, is *crying*. 

Grateful tears pour down the herder's face, and he raises a single hand to wave goodbye.

Then, Erritis is gone.</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes! Wait. No," he says, looking at the others behind you. "You have too many people with you. And unless someone wants to let me ride on their back...?"

He trails off hopefully. 
</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sags. "I'll just go through that portal then. The one you came through, I mean. It looks twinkly and *safe*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tears streak down the creases in his leathery skin, skin that lost the softness of youth long ago. "You should have found me sooner, when I was strong enough to fight them still. When there was still time to reason with them."

He lowers his head, and the aura closes on him like spilling water, drowning him under it.</DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What?" he says, eyebrows nearly flying off his forehead. "I don't need apologies. I don't even know what you're apologizing for!"

His grin almost - but not entirely - hides the waning desperation in his eyes.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"LET US INTO HIM AGAIN," the Audience pleads. "LET US MAKE HIM STRONG *weak*. WITHOUT US, HE WILL BE USELESS TO YOU. HE WILL BE NORMAL *fragile* WEAK *pathetic*." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"HONOR *glory* HERO *punish* ERROR *error* ERROR."
 
A tiny star flares at the center of the golden cloud in your hands. Another. And soon, a ripple of spider-webbing flame races outwards as the nano-demons rupture one by one. The flames don't hurt. They *tingle*.

At last, smoke rises from your empty hands and unburnt skin. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He squints his eyes at Rhin. "Come to think of it... I'm not even sure *who* you are..." He shakes his head and turns his attention back to you.</DefaultText>
