      <DefaultText>The three figures before you are disoriented. They don't even seem to notice you at first. All three of them have a tattoo like yours - castoffs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I do not believe so." The second figure is tall, dressed all in black. Its height is exaggerated further by a violet, fish-like crest on the top of its head. Its large yellow eyes are squinted, scanning all around. "There was a man *outside* the clock, but it wasn't-"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was him." The third figure points at you. He is small, wiry, and tense as though he expects danger. He carries a shield on his back. "He's a castoff," he says, looking at your tattoo. "Can't say I recognize him, though."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman steps forward. "We beg your forgiveness, friend, brother. We have been through quite the trial. I am Kamose. These are my friends, Diviaticu and Villon. We are castoffs, like you." She looks you up and down, her brow slightly furrowed despite her kind demeanor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The varjellen looks up at the ceiling - or where the ceiling would be if there were one. "Time is an illusion. 'How long?' is the wrong question." It turns its enormous, bulbous eyes to you. "What is this place? Where are we?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She raises one eyebrow significantly higher than the other. "I've met *scores* of castoffs, yet you are new to my eyes and ears. How can that be? Diviaticu is the youngest castoff *I* am aware of. Have you remained hidden since your birth?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A fair challenge and a fair question. We thought to catch our sire off-guard, and perhaps we did, but he was still too quick. He did something, *subsuming* us into that clock of his. We've been trapped in there for days, now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our consciousnesses were ripped from our bodies when the Changing God activated his clock. Then when you appeared, it happened again - our minds ripped from their chronal prison."

It looks to its friends. "I cannot be certain, but I believe this is part of some vast mental construct." He turns to you. "*Your* mental construct."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes become nearly as large as the varjellen's. "What? You mean we just went from one prison to another?"

He grips you by the shoulders. "*You* did this. If this is your mind, then let us out!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, yes." She looks down, embarrassed. "The three of us once worked alongside our sire, helping him with his research after he'd brought the Order of Truth to Sagus Cliffs. We... we saw him for what he was - selfish, arrogant."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We betrayed him," she says. "The Changing God. But he was too fast. When he activated the clock, it trapped our minds somehow... the same way you did, in fact."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The varjellen stretches its neck, putting its face within a handspan of yours. It seems to be examining you. Then it says, "*Your* mind. Only *you* have the power to change."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What he's trying to say is that this place was created for your body, or perhaps *by* your body. Our sire placed within each of us unique gifts and abilities. For example, I have never heard tell of another castoff who could trap consciousnesses the way that you have."

She gives you a warm smile. "He would not have created this space for you without also giving you a means by which to move through it. Think. What *other* gifts did our creator bestow upon you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The glaive nods. "Yes," she says. "We can all do that to one degree or another. It is our blessing and our curse. I don't think it will help us here, however. What do you think, Diviaticu?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>It considers you a moment, then shakes its head. "No. The power of the Tides is an unintended byproduct of the process that created us. But if our sire tied this mental construct to *you*, then he did so intentionally. The solution lies somewhere else."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I chose an aspect of myself when I was born, deep in the heart of this labyrinth. Is that it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>Diviaticu shakes his head. "I can see what you speak of," it says, and you get a momentary impression that its eyes can see *through* you. "This aspect describes you, just as I am varjellen, Villon is observant, Kamose is foolish."</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>He gives a kind chuckle. "He's not wrong, and you know it."

At her wounded look, he raises his hands placatingly. "It's the truth! Anyway, you've gotten us out of twice as much trouble as you get us into."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>The varjellen speaks to you. "These aspects are descriptors of who we are, but they are not us. That you *chose* your aspect says quite a lot... but I do not believe that is enough to set us free."</DefaultText>

      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives you a kind smile. "The gift is in you. Perhaps you have just forgotten. Our sire wouldn't have made this place for you without granting you the power to get out. Focus. Find the answer inside yourself."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You must!" She looks at her compatriots and back to you. "We each have our gifts, given to us by our sire for a specific purpose - *his* purpose of course, but a purpose nonetheless."

She presses a hand to her chest. "They say, for example, that - foolish though I may be - I have nigh magical gifts of speech. That is not something I chose nor learned, but it is who he made me to be."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He rubs his hand along the edge of his shield. "I am a master of defensive arts. Our sire learned them when he was in my body, probably built my body to excel at it. I wouldn't call it a *gift*, but... it's me, yeah."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You rifle through your memories, past everything you *actually* remember to those memories you didn't create yourself. There must be a key or a door - anything that would help you to escape this fathom of your mind.

Just as you're about to give up, you find something, a cluster of sparks, nascent abilities deep within the core of your being. You sense the abilities to speak eloquently, to use a shield with a master's skill, to lurk among the shadows as though they were home...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>None of these seem particularly suited to creating a path out of this place. But as you sift through them, you *know* that you are trapped here, not because it is some puzzle your sire left for you to solve, but because you are not yet *whole*.

      <DefaultText>All of these and more are in the depths of your memories, as though this body recalls every gift the Changing God ever had. Some sparks are buried deeper than the others, inaccessible at the moment, but *there*. Perhaps with time and experience, you might find a way to access more than just those within easy reach.
