Its thoughts bombard you, complex and textured, incomprehensible, clashing with the connections you've already forged with other reflections. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Its thoughts, long and oddly textured, slide against yours like two hands clasping / waves joining / shadows merging...

Holding your head, you take a deep breath, and the nychthemeron's alien presence settles into a corner of your mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hazy form of the nychthemeron you met before hovers motionless here. Its many eyes converge on the center of your forehead, as if the creature is trying to hold you in place. </DefaultText>

Or... to breach your defenses. Its many-faceted gaze slips, keylike, into you, nudging your thoughts aside. You feel its alien regard pulling at your consciousness, trying to align its thoughts with your own.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hazy form of the nychthemeron you met before hovers motionless here - here, in your mind. Its many eyes converge on the center of your forehead, as if the creature is trying to hold you in place. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>And you do feel *something* when each orb locks onto you - a pinning sensation in the corner of your mind. A fragment of the nychthemeron's incomprehensible and alien thoughts. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something... something has happened on an instinctual level. You've established a bond with this reflection. Some of its gifts are yours, and you feel stronger for it. 

However, this link fully occupies a corner of your mind. You may be able to forge connections with more than one reflection in the Labyrinth, but not many. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Observation," the creature says, before you can speak. "This one has analyzed available data and a conclusion has been reached. Summary: this one is not a nychthemeron. This one is data in a nychthemeron's shape, and will be unable to answer questions regarding the organism the human has encountered."

Its eyes roll inward. "This one requires new designation. Processing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The creature's eyes turn inward for a long moment as it considers your question. 

"This one acknowledges a number of emotions, namely confusion-fear-frustration. This one does not yet know why it exists or why it is here. Perhaps this will come in time."

Its eyes return to you. "To answer the original inquiry: no."</DefaultText>
