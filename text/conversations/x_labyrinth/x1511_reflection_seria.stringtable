      <DefaultText>A woman-shaped hole in the air stands before you, her palms outstretched, and you sense something... different. A smell, if emotions could smell. 

It is sharp confusion and a sense of displacement. Somehow, this woman-shade knows she does not belong here in your mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh," says the Specter, strolling up beside you. "A reflection from a different castoff, isn't it?"

He studies the outline's outstretched hands. "She's lost something," he says after a moment. "Something out in the world that she misplaced... or was taken from her. If you want to draw her here, you'll have to find it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You turn back to the woman-shaped void. She continues to face you, hands held out imploringly, ignoring the Specter completely.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Orseolo. He was one of you," she says carelessly. "A castoff, I mean."

A frown creases her forehead. "Poor old man. He never wanted to be special. He found me, fed me, talked to me when I was, you know, troubled." 

She sighs. "But when the house fell on me, I guess... he couldn't stand it. And he went looking for a way to die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She falls silent, but you don't need to be told what happened next. You've seen the statue, after all. It was grief that drove Orseolo to seek death in the Sorrow's arms. 

Seria watches you, eyes shining with some inner light.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No!" she says fiercely. "He's the only one who *tried* to help me. I was always confused." She sweeps the hair from her eyes. "I had a voice in my mind, a woman... telling me I was supposed to be *her*. Orseolo tried - so hard - to make me feel better. To talk to me when it was really bad." She smiles sadly. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't be. He tried to help me, but my life wasn't so wonderful. I was always confused." She sweeps the hair from her eyes. "I had a voice in my mind, a woman... telling me I was supposed to be *her*. Orseolo tried - so hard - to make me feel better. To talk to me when it was really bad." She smiles sadly. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But I think he knew it couldn't last," she says, her smile fading. "He was afraid, but not for himself. He believed - no, *knew* - I was going to die. One time, he said he'd seen me die too many times, then shut himself up." She claps a hand to her mouth, lowers it. "Like that."

She shrugs. "But he wasn't wrong, was he? Even if he was a little crazy to begin with."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods moodily. 

"Sort of," she says. "I'm not really *me*, though. I'm a reflection of what my father saw of me. The only piece of his mind that's left."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When he died, his... *part* of the Labyrinth, well... I want to say it broke, but it was worse than that. The cracks burst up through the ground and everything started crumbling. I could feel parts of him slipping away. Snapping off."

She shudders. "I'm glad you brought me here. I would have fallen apart eventually. And then there'd be nothing of him left. Nothing of either of us."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Really?" she says with a snort. "You don't think he had a reason to hide?"

She sweeps the hair from her eyes. "Besides, I... I kept him busy, when I was alive. I was always so confused. I had a voice in my mind, a woman... telling me I was supposed to be *her*. Orseolo tried - so hard - to make me feel better. To talk to me when it was really bad." She smiles sadly. </DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He thought he could help me," she says simply. "He tried to calm me when that woman's voice in my head said I was her and not me."

She smiles sadly. "I wasn't the first. He'd helped other girls like me before."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No," she says, staring at the air, thinking. "He didn't abuse his power, like some of you do. Didn't pull against the Tides or use them as weapons. He never wanted to be noticed, to be found."

She breathes in, breathes out. "Didn't matter, did it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My father gave it to me," she says, beaming down at the ghostly version of the box in her hands. "He said it was a very old puzzle, and that solving it would help me."

She chuckles. "I never did, but fumbling with it made me feel better. I always had the feeling that the pictures on it might mean something, but that was as far as I got."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You gently place the cube in the shadowy figure's hands. They close over it, and -

A young woman - the one you found dead in the ruins of the house - plunges toward you out of the darkness, filling the outline until the outline *is* her. She nearly stumbles into you before she stops herself, blinking hard.

"Ouch," she says. You notice that the box you gave her is now as ghostly as she is.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman-shaped void does not respond in any way. The Tides within you, however, do. 

You feel them uncoiling from you, reaching into the gap for whatever is lost within. Perhaps you can use them to pull the woman into being.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wouldn't," he says conversationally. "I mean, it will *probably* work, but there's no telling what will happen. Just off the top of my head, it *might* give you the worst headache you've ever had. But it would probably be worse than that."</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't think she can hear you," he says. "For that matter, I don't think it's even a 'she' right now. She's more of a placeholder than a person. An arrow pointing somewhere else in the Labyrinth."

He peers cautiously into the outline in the air as though it is a long and potentially dangerous tunnel. "You'll need to find what she's missing before you can bring her forward. And you won't find it here, I think." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your plunge your mind into the frozen void before you, looking for the source of this reflection. 

There. A star shines in a cold, crumbling bastion, far along the forgotten borders of the Labyrinth. Without thinking, you tangle your thoughts around it - her - and pull her back into *your* mind. 

The woman hurtles out of the icy dark, eyes wide and bloodshot, filling the outline until the outline *is* her. She stumbles into your Labyrinth, wincing, hugging herself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something is wrong. She clutches her face, gasping, fingers digging into her scalp, baring her teeth like a wounded animal.

      <DefaultText>"I was hearing voices. Telling me to be-" She doubles over, coughing, her belly. "Telling me... to be s-someone else. He found me. Helped me."

A line of blood runs from an open wound in her hairline and down her cheek. "Then. One day. The house fell on me. He wanted-"

She gasps, and a tear slices down her other cheek. "Wanted to die." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>She falls silent, but you don't need to be told what happened next. You've seen the statue, after all. It was grief that drove Orseolo to seek death in the Sorrow's arms.

Dark red blood seeps through the young woman's clothes and she reaches out for you. Blisters rise on her forearms in a stippled flood.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In response, she gurgles as great bloody rifts split her arms, bite through her shoulders, and cut her throat. Her eyes bulge and burst. 

Orseolo's daughter falls apart in a mangled jumble of limbs.

Grinning again, she rolls her eyes. "And that's it. That's all I know about the man who raised me for years. Kids, huh?"</DefaultText>
