      <DefaultText>Swaying, you open your eyes. You're back in the Labyrinth, with the warmth of that gentle touch still fading from your skin. 

A woman-shaped hole in the air stands before you, her palms outstretched, and you sense something... different. A smell, if emotions could smell. 

It is sharp confusion and a sense of displacement. Somehow, this woman-shade knows she does not belong here in your mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh," says the Specter, strolling up beside you. "A reflection from a different castoff, isn't it?"

He studies the outline's outstretched hands. "She's lost something," he says after a moment. "Something out in the world that she misplaced... or was taken from her. If you want to draw her here, you'll have to find it."

      <DefaultText>Concentrating, you cast your mind over the Labyrinth, looking for the source of this reflection. This young woman. 

There. A star shines in a cold, crumbling bastion, far along the forgotten borders. Without thinking, you plunge your hands into the outline, gritting your teeth at the sting of the dark, jagged air...

...and feel warm hands grasping your wrists. You pull, and the young woman *flies* towards you, filling the outline until the outline is *her*.

      <DefaultText>You gently place the cube in the shadowy figure's hands. They close over it, and -

A young woman - the one you found dead in the ruins of the house - plunges toward you out of the darkness, filling the outline until the outline *is* her. She nearly stumbles into you before she stops herself, blinking hard.

"Ouch," she says. You notice that the box you gave her is now as ghostly as she is.

      <DefaultText>The woman-shaped void does not respond in any way. The Tides within you, however, do. 

You feel them uncoiling from you, reaching into the gap for whatever is lost within. Perhaps you can use them to pull the woman into being.

He peers cautiously into the outline in the air as though it is a long and potentially dangerous tunnel. "You'll need to find what she's missing before you can bring her forward. And you won't find it here, I think." </DefaultText>

A frown creases her forehead. "Poor old man. He never wanted to be special. He found me, fed me, talked to me when I was, you know, troubled." 

She sighs. "But when the house fell on me, I guess... he couldn't stand it. And he went looking for a way to die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No," she says, staring at the air, thinking. "He didn't abuse his power, like some of you do. Didn't pull against the Tides or use them as weapons. He never wanted to be noticed, to be found."

She breathes in, breathes out. "Didn't matter, did it?"

There. A star shines in a cold, crumbling bastion, far along the forgotten borders of the Labyrinth. Without thinking, you tangle your thoughts around it - her - and pull her back into *your* mind. 

The woman hurtles out of the icy dark, eyes wide and bloodshot, filling the outline until the outline *is* her. She stumbles into your Labyrinth, wincing, hugging herself.
