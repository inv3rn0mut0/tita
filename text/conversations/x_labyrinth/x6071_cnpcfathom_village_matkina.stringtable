      <DefaultText>Matkina holds her weapons tightly and screams.

As you come close, the shadows around her solidify. She is reliving the horrors of the attack on Kholn, and for a moment you're there with her. The First's militia lashes out with their weapons, and the villagers transform into their monstrous forms again. Her weapons have no effect, and her dying friends gout blood that washes around her boots.

      <DefaultText>She is not initially aware of the player, but she speaks and the player can speak to her.
The vision torments her, reminding her of all the betrayal she has ever experienced, how she outlives the people she loves and is endlessly betrayed by her cursed siblings.

The player's choices with her will depend on how he has dealt with her up to this point:

The player can say any of the following. Each has reactivity (at least Tidal, if not reactivity in the end game). Whether or not they pull Matkina from her trap depends on the PC's relationship with her--essentially whether she trusts him or not:</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If Tash is present, he will be a part of her torment. If the player played Tash as a good character in the Mere, then the player can remind Matkina of that.

      <DefaultText>She is not looking at you. She's not *talking* to you. But then her head snaps back, and she sees you for the first time. "What are... what are you doing... here..." 

She steps out of your arms and quickly sheathes her weapon. "By the Black Three, that's embarrassing. I suppose I owe you gratitude for getting me out of that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though Tash can't see you, he can somehow sense your presence. He scowls in concentration, and a psychic barrier keeps you from Matkina. You'll have to deal with him first if you want to free her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The faces in her nightmare change and twist. You see the First's mask, Paj's face, Melmoth, the Memovira... countless faces, jeering, mocking, spilling their contempt across her...

She fights savagely against the faces arrayed against her - each another stone in a wall of betrayal and mistrust.

She's muttering and whimpering, as if caught in a living dream, and you can hear her whispers. "Traitor... murderer of dreams. Butcher. My fault. Must scatter you... burn you!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen for the briefest moment. "I'll hold you to that, shall I? Forget all about that pouch of shins I lifted off you earlier?"

She laughs. "All right."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her lips part, a feral sneer of anticipation. "I will. When I find the First, I'll carve her so deep no mask will hide her scars."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You put your hand on her shoulder to shove her, and she lashes out, quick as lightning. You snatch your hand away just in time.

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>You reach out again, barely pulling away in time to avoid her blade. This isn't working. Her illusion is too strong. You sense the knowledge you need to help her is in the Labyrinth somewhere, but not here in this fathom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm here, Neng," she says.

The shadows leer and twist around her, and a distorted version of Paj's face looms in the air. She raises a flame-lance high over her head and strikes swiftly. Matkina knocks it aside, plunging a knife in the shadow's body.

The ferocious heat from the lance washes over you even as the lance vanishes. This illusion is *powerful* - too powerful to just talk her out of it.

In a whisper almost too soft to hear, you hear Matkina say, "I don't want to fight anymore."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You step forward, arms outstretched. She sees you and attacks, driving her knife into your gut. She's too tortured to hit any vitals, but it still *hurts*. You come closer and put your arms around her.

"Wha...?" She blinks, noticing you for the first time. "Tash? No... who are you?"

She looks around at shades you can barely see. "They're all dead." Tears well up in her eyes. "*All* of them. I did this. If it weren't for me..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her illusion is more powerful than it should be. She's aware of you, but just barely. What she *needs* is to stop fighting, and the only way she's going to do that is if she believes her enemies are dead.

Perhaps you need to become one of her enemies.</DefaultText>

She's only barely aware of your words, not enough to change what she sees. Her torment is particularly strong, and the knowledge you need to free her isn't here. You'll have to search elsewhere in the Labyrinth to find a way to help her.</DefaultText>
