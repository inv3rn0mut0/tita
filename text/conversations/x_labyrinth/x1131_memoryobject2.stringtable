      <DefaultText>This orb - this memory - resembles an eye or masked face. It turns to face you with cold disdain. Mechanisms spin and mesh beneath the gleaming surface, and an ominous *ticking* begins, getting faster and faster. 

Two cold facts emerge from the mental gap this memory once occupied - the ticking does indeed mean that the device will soon explode, and you have no one to blame but yourself. This trap is yours, built to protect the memory within.

      <DefaultText>You stand beside a woman on a verdant crag. Beneath the two of you is a broad plateau towering above the overgrowth far below. Strange machines have been built into the cliffside, presumably for reconnaissance or defense. A metallic disk gleams from the center of the plateau.

Your self-aware, humanoid machines drill into the base of the cliffs below. If you were looking for a sanctuary - and you were, desperately - this seems like the right place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't know about this," the woman says, her voice flat, neutral. Her face is turned away from you. "What makes this place any more secure than the other ones we've found?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You shade your eyes against the bright sun so that you can point out the thin bands radiating out from the metallic disk, how the energy from those bands affects the local fauna, suggesting an enormous source of prior world energy.

She thinks deeply. "It's geologically sound? Have you run the sounding samples and checked the strata? No major caverns or weaknesses showed up on your resonance scans?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A cloud passes over the sun as you engage her in spirited, friendly debate, pointing out the footprint of a prior world civilization whose power remains untapped.

After a few minutes, she laughs, raising her hands in mock surrender. "Stop, stop! Your servitors are down there. You've already chosen this as the site, haven't you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A slight chill enters the air as you describe the potential power of the metallic disk below and the sealed vaults beneath it. She nods.

"So that's what your servitor machines are doing down there? You've already chosen this as the site, haven't you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She waits for your affirmation, and says, "All right. I'm convinced." The two of you sketch your plans for the sanctuary, drawing schematics and architectural diagrams. Then you descend onto the plateau to examine the open ground.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman suggests having one of the servitors build a shelter for your time here. You try to draw one of the constructs away from its task, but it doesn't respond to your voice. When you lay a hand on its shoulder to reinforce your command, it whirls and strikes you across the face with inhuman speed. It turns back to its task, ignoring you.

Your companion helps you rise, laughter in her eyes. "It seems your construct has other ideas. What's the matter with it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A mist falls onto the plateau as you activate the time-scarred artifacts fastened to the construct's behavioral core with a subvocalized command. With an abrupt *clack* and a pulse of pleasant warmth, the devices purge the error, and seven copper-banded spheres drop out of evenly-spaced rifts in the air. 

Ignoring this common side effect, you give new orders to the malfunctioning construct in a firm, clear voice.

"ACKNOWLEDGED." It obediently trundles to the site of your new shelter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Everything resolves into sharp focus, and you see that the servitor's rear actuators are corrupted.

You dig into the construct's back - it seems not to mind as long as you don't interfere with its task. Deftly, you reset the actuators and see energy spark into disused portions of the construct's brain. The construct resumes its work... and this time it listens when you speak to it.

      <DefaultText>A mist falls onto the plateau as you wrap a fiber shielding mesh around the construct's skull. The mesh powers up, protecting the construct's mind from any transdimensional emissions that might be in the area. Taking a deep breath, you repeat your command.

      <DefaultText>The image freezes, then fades, and you feel the memory filling the gap in your mind, block by jagged block. You stagger, clutching your head - reclaiming your memories *hurts*. 

And once more, there's something else. Hairs lift, one by one, on the back of your neck. Something beyond this room can sense what you are doing... and is hunting you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Carefully, you reach through the misty surface of the orb, around blurring, saw-toothed gears, and pluck out the heart of the device.

Suddenly the orb cracks at your touch, sending a memory jolting up through your arm into your mind...

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>You focus, shutting out the racing ticks of the device, and see hands reaching out, gently cupping the sides of the orb like an upturned face.

You touch the orb in the same way, and the mechanisms within grow still as the warmth of the memory races up your arms and into your mind...

      <DefaultText>While reaching through the misty surface of the orb, your hand slips, and a blurring edge of a gear slices into your fingertip before ratcheting to a stop. Your body becomes more deft in the attempt, however.

Suddenly, a painful memory jolts through the wound, racing toward your mind...

      <DefaultText>While reaching through the misty surface of the orb, your hand slips, and gets caught between two grinding, coarse-toothed gears, jamming the delicate mechanisms completely. Even in the attempt, though, you feel your body becoming more deft.

Suddenly, a painful memory shudders up the bones of your arm and into your mind...

      <DefaultText>The ticking increases in tempo, faster and faster, rising into a deafening, agonizing clatter. The connections in your mind grow and strengthen to compensate, but not fast enough.

You clap your hands over your ringing ears just before the memory trapped inside the orb explodes through your mind...

      <DefaultText>Forgetting the frenzied ticking, you focus, and see hands - but oddly, not *your* hands - reaching out to gently cup the sides of the orb like an upturned face. You feel the connections in your mind increasing, strengthening.

You touch the orb in the same way, and the mechanisms spin to a humming stop as the warmth of the memory races up your arms and into your mind...
