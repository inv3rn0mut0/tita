      <DefaultText>Your palm connects with Raima's cheek and the shout of rage she emits makes you consider the wisdom of this approach. Then she blinks and looks around her in confusion.

Then her glower returns, though a flicker of doubt remains.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As your palm connects with Raima's cheek, it occurs to you that a warrior of her caliber may not take such an affront well. The flaring of her nostrils proves you right.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you point out inconsistencies between the world she can see and the real one, Raima slowly relaxes. Bit by bit her shoulders droop, then go lax, then finally she lets her weapon fall to her side.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>Before she can pull away, you grasp Raima by the  arms and shake her back and forth. Her immediate reaction: raising her weapon. But she hesitates. And gradually her eyes clear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vigorous shaking only serves to heat her anger. "You'll pay for that, Traitor."</DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>You unleash the power of the Tides. The energy flowing through you is painful, but Raima staggers as they wash the illusion from her mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What happened?" She looks around, recognizing you and what's going on around her. "I see. Well, I doubt you're here just to save me. You helped me in Miel Avest. I'll support you as best as I can."</DefaultText>
