      <DefaultText>You allow Inifere to draw part of you into his pain-hollowed heart, and in turn you take part of his agony into yourself. 

In doing so, you feel yourself harden and grow stronger, though it is a strength that seems to twist inside you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hazy form of Inifere stands before you. For all his lack of substance, he is no less bowed by the unseen burdens he bears. His eyes, locked on yours, are solid enough to convey an unspoken woe.</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>The longer you hold his gaze, the more his pain is cast into you, as if transfused, darkening an already twilight world. Whatever "calm" this place holds means nothing to your brother.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something... something has happened on an instinctual level. You've established a bond with Inifere and created a reflection of him in your mind. Some of the reflection's gifts are yours, and you feel stronger for it. 

However, this bond fully occupies a corner of your subconscious. You may be able to forge connections with more than one reflection in the Labyrinth, but not many. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Inifere laughs raggedly. "*Comfort*, brother? Never. I grieve the grave bereaved from me. I crave the one you cleaved from me. I yearn for peace you thieved from me. And none can shrieve this slave you made of me, or save the salve you slayed through me."

He gasps for air to fill his ghostly lungs, then hisses: "She is *gone*, brother, yet we endure. The world cannot purge itself of our rancid lives. Our father's curse courses through us both and denies us death's kiss."</DefaultText>

Then, for just a moment, his haggard features seem to soften. "But there are worse holes to hide in, and worse homes than the head of he who felled me."</DefaultText>

He pauses for a moment, and his bleak gaze seems to stretch beyond you. "If there is a way to weave whole her ripped and ragged heart, the threads she needs will not be found in us. We hold only Tides, brother, and jagged shoals to shatter others' hulls."</DefaultText>
