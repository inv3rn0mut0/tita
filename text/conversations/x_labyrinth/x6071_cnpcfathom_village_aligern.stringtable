      <DefaultText>As you approach, you see Aligern trapped in a repeating loop of tortured time. The shadow of a black metal frame looms behind him, and a flood of night-black monsters pours from it, red in eye and tooth. Shadowy villagers lurch and scream as the monsters fasten onto them. Their faces come clear for a moment, agony and fear their defining traits.

Two stand out - a woman and her daughter.

Aligern sobs, helpless. The creatures close in.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stands up and opens his eyes, and the inky creatures fade. The villagers fade. Last to go are his wife and daughter. He holds his hand out to them, as if he could touch smoke, and the tattoos on his arms burn and hiss. When the vision has faded altogether, he drops his hand and weeps.

After a moment, he dries his face, and the familiar bitterness has regained its place. "Thanks, I guess. Now what?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You watch Aligern torn apart again and again, an endlessly repeating cycle of despair, destruction, and violence, but you are unable to stop it. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cycle continues again and again. You step away rather than watch any longer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ink-black creatures gnash and tear, but Aligern's friends and family bleed light. As it falls to the ground, it spills around Aligern's feet. and he shrieks with endless terror. The light draws around him like a net, like a noose, choking him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You know the truth of what you see here - that the creatures that assail Aligern's family are not destroying them. The beasts are copying the villagers, transmuting them into data that will be patterned into Aligern's arms. Maybe reminding him of the truth will set him free of his suffering.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Reason creeps onto his face, and the numb horror recedes. The blackness that spills from the frame is gone.

He lays a hand on a tattoo and pulls it halfway from his skin. "I know you. I *know* you."

He laughs, delighted. "I know all of you!" He reaches into his skin and lifts a handful of them into the air. "Oh, my friends. Isatrina! Avija! I am... I am..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shivers. "No... I... it was..." He covers his eyes. "It was a mistake. I shouldn't have activated the frame. I..." His shoulders slump.

"All right. All right."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've got too many with you already. If you want to clear some space, that's fine. I'd be happy to join you again. Otherwise, I'll find my way out myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not with you. You might have freed me from that nightmare, but you've made my life a hell. I'm done with you. I'll find my own way out."

He turns and stalks away.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And here I thought we might renew our acquaintance. A pity you insist on holding onto old wounds, Aligern, but not a surprise. Not at all."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "I've gotten over the hatred, Callistege. But you and I aren't friends, and I doubt we'd ever be allies. Too much history, and I'm mature enough to recognize that at least part of that is because of me. I'm also adult enough to recognize it would be a poisonous situation."

He turns back to you. "No, I'm not going to rejoin you while she's here. No."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Rid yourself of her, and maybe we can work something out."

      <DefaultText>He lets the tattoos sink back into his skin. "How is this possible? How do I know the answer now? How do I..." He turns to you, and realization dawns on his face. "It was you. You unlocked the answer."

"You showed me the secret to releasing them from the trap of my skin. When we've returned to the world, I'll set them loose."

He swallows deeply. "Thank you, friend. Thank you. So. What now?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>His teeth are white and feral, an angry, instinctive grin. "I know that. The pain is what holds me together." With an act of will, he unclenches his fists.</DefaultText>
