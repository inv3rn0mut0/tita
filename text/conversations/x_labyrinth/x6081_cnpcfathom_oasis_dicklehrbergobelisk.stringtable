      <DefaultText>An obelisk thrusts from the platform like a horn, or a claw, or a tongue. Its parti-colored surface has a shimmer to it and a slick texture - not quite mineral, but not quite organic, either.

The garish appearance belies something ancient, even wise, that seems to radiate from the obelisk - as if it were here at the beginning, or close to it, yet retained its youthful energy.

Four runes are carved into it, symbols of a civilization that predated the Truth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The obelisk - garish, ancient, and etched with four runes - continues to radiate a sense of hidden wisdom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you lay your hand on the slick surface, the patterns move and swirl like living plasma. Actually, no - they aren't moving at all. It was merely a hallucination of some kind.

You have a sense that this has happened before, this, and more. A memory shifts and contorts through your mind, like the colors on the obelisk. It is just a matter of catching hold of it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A broad smile spreads across your face as you feel the wisdom welling out from the stone. The two ghibra beside you - who helped scrap centuries of encrustation from the stone - sense nothing.

From your satchel you take a fleshy, living artifact engrafted with various devices and crystals. You lay it on the obelisk and watch as one of the crystals begins to glow faintly, siphoning off the obelisk's psychic emissions. You, and you alone, will reap the bounty of its teachings.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memory slips away, but in its place, thoughts surge up from the obelisk. They are human thoughts, but the thoughts of a man separated from you by such a vast abyss of ages as to be nearly alien.

You sense an inquisitive mind, sly humor, and a canny sense for a good bargain. You snatch at scraps and patches of this old-timer's experience: travels to distant lands long gone from history, exotic goods haggled down and then hauled back to his home markets.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>They are simple shapes: something like a heavy quadruped in profile, a serpentine double curve, a two-tined comb, and a right-angled corner. But despite their simplicity - or perhaps because of it - their meaning is inscrutable.

They could be simple glyphs depicting actual things from an ancient civilization, or symbolic ideograms, or phonemes, or senseless graffiti. They could be a warning or an invitation, a name or an epitaph. So goes man's attempt to instill meaning on the world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You study the strange protrusion, seeking some meaning in its colorful whorls and patterns. Like all numenera, its exact nature is hopelessly beyond the ken of later worlds. But from your training, you have a basic sense of what it might be: some kind of psychic battery, storing a person's thoughts or memories or very self.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You study the strange protrusion, seeking some meaning in its colorful whorls and patterns. No answers emerge, just the consistent - insistent - sense that it has something to teach. 

This feeling grows stronger the closer you come to the obelisk.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But the very alienness of his mind is too much for yours - a cognitive dissonance becomes cacophonous, until your mind breaks loose before it is deafened altogether.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Even as you pull free of the obelisk, you feel a surge of psychic energy blast outward from it.

Whatever it meant to teach you - for good or ill - vanishes into the ether.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the memory fades, you sense that the obelisk's energy has dissipated in the time you were lost in your own, more recent, past.

The *thing* that had tapped the obelisk is long gone, so whatever it meant to share has vanished into the ether.</DefaultText>
