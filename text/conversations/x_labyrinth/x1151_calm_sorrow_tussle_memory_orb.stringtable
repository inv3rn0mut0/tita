      <DefaultText>The orb's light strobes insistently, a blazing pyre in your mind's eye. 

This is no test, no struggle to define yourself. This orb *needs* you, and it lurches toward you. A staggering blast of immediacy envelops you, dragging you inside.

The memory comes flicker-fast, a welter of impressions: terror, loathing, disgust, but most of all, the primal horror of nothingness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Are these your memories? You don't know. You *can't* know.

Scenes flash before your eyes. A laboratory, a desert arroyo, the darkness of space through an observatory's window... and the constant presence is the black stain of the creature that has hunted you for all these centuries. 

And now the memory solidifies. The name inscribes itself on your heart: The Sorrow. The Sorrow is the hunter. The Sorrow is death. The Sorrow is oblivion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your memory is a collage of images, and in each of them the Sorrow's wrath descends more quickly, drawing ever closer to destroying you utterly. You feel its malign influence within you, a terminal mortality reflected in the fragment you face. You see your utter doom just as your life begins... You tumble out of the memory.

And then a flare overwhelms your vision, and you feel a *familiar*, almost-comforting presence.</DefaultText>
