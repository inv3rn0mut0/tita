      <DefaultText>If Tol Maguur is present, the player will have to release Tol from her illusion before he can release Rhin. Whatever the player says, she'll be too afraid to be convinced of anything as long as Tol is present. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If neither Rhin nor Erritis are present, then Tol will be trapped in an illusion-the slavers (which might not actually be slavers in her vision) have turned on her. The writer is welcome to think of a way to get her out, or it might be that the player can't rescue her from this illusion and she's doomed forever.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The slaver Tol Maguur is here, her arms flailing across her body. Shades of her Tide-addicted compatriots flicker around her, substanceless specters who radiate a burning, ephemeral *need*. Her hands pass through them, and each time she looks as if she is going to vomit. Her feet are buried in the ground - she cannot move.

You feel the Tides coil within you, perhaps as a response to the hungry ghosts that surround Tol.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No. No, you never have. You're not like the rest of us." She looks away, and looks back, and then reaches out her hand. "All right. I do trust you."

As she touches you, she begins to fade. She regards her feet with amusement as she lifts them from the floor. She lowers herself gently to the ground then, her hand still clasped in yours.</DefaultText>

You step close, wrap your arms around her neck, and with a quick yank and twist, you break her spine.

She collapses to the ground, gagging and twitching. A few long moments later, she dies. Her body dissolves, sinking into the floor of the Labyrinth, and she is gone.</DefaultText>
