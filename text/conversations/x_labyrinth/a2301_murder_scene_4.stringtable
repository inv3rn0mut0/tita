      <DefaultText>A flayed hand lies at the center of a lake of blood. Its ragged stump points directly at the crimson circle painted on the nearby wall. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stump of the severed hand at the center of the pool points at center of the bloody circle on the wall, as though attached to it by an invisible arm. 

You get the oddest sense that If you watch the hand long enough, it will move. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Only thin, nearly transparent slivers of flesh cling to the glistening tendons of the skinned hand. They taste of...

*Agony. Screams that strip a throat raw. A blurred figure, cutting quickly. Teeth, bound by a joyful grin.*

The memory falls apart, leaving you panting. Whoever the murderer is, they took great care to peel all flesh from the hand. It seems they suspected the Dendra O'Hur might use this method to discover their secrets.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Haven't seen this is a while," Matkina says softly, coming up beside you. "That's no simple circle. That's the symbol of the Children of the Endless Gate."

She snorts. "They're a sect of the Dendra O'Hur that prefers living meat instead of dead. The Dendra chased them out of the city a long time ago, but it doesn't look like one of them took the hint."

      <DefaultText>Fresh blood streams over the circle, yanking you through the hollow space within into the world beyond. 

Tumorous, throbbing clouds hang from the gray sky over a landscape riven by raw, crusted wounds. Jagged ruins are visible here and there like splinters embedded in blistered flesh. Many-legged things crawl through them, moaning against the stone, and though you are far away, you know they sense you. You can feel their minds spilling towards yours, seeking, tasting...

Joyful. Hungry.</DefaultText>

After that world, a sight as mundane as the bloody pool at your feet almost comes as a relief. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You slam your mind shut like a door. The memory claws at you, and for a moment, you see the world beyond the gate - a gray, tumorous sky, a landscape riven with red wounds...

And then, the vision collapses, leaving you breathless and weary. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your hand reaches towards the streaks and bubbles of blood of its own accord, and an iron spike drives through your temples. 

A man stands before a blank wall. Sickening purple-black light spills around the corner behind him. This is his labyrinth, and he has been driven into a dead end. By *her*.

Blood seeps through the wall from the other, drawing the familiar shape. Frightened, confused, the man traces the line... and gate opens with a wet *crunch*...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You study the dashes and bleeding pinpricks decorating - *binding* - the circle. They aren't symbols in any known human tongue, but you sense their purpose. 

The circle was almost inconsequential. These sigils *gripped* the shape of it and *pushed* it through time and space. This was, however briefly, a transdimensional portal to another place. Now, it is dead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is immediately clear that the dashes and bleeding pinpricks decorating this circle are not random. This is a symbol, drawn with careful intent. 

Unfortunately, it means nothing to you. </DefaultText>
