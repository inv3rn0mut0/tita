      <DefaultText>As soon as you are aware of them, they become aware of you. They converge on your presence, the weight of their immense knowledge threatening to crush you.

Instinctively, your mind throws up a shield to surround you, an isolated space within the darkness. The minds outside crash against it, trying to break in, but the shield holds strong.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your initial estimate of their numbers was far off, you now realize. There are trillions, maybe quadrillions. You can sense just the fringes of their personalities and memories before driving yourself mad, and what you sense are minds that have existed for eons, from all eras and corners of the universe.

They are not malevolent, but they will definitely snuff you out in their effort to learn what you know and bring you among them, and that's not what you need right now.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The minds outside fade away, and you sense the presence of other objects appearing in the space - representations of your will. Or perhaps not *your* will. Like the shield, you aren't so much creating the objects as recalling things that had already been created once. This shell, like your own, once belonged to someone else. Two things come sharply to your mind, symbols of will in the form of simple objects: a circular window and a metallic cube.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The window is a convex lens, magnifying the outside. The minds are actually shining latticeworks of light. And the space between them is not empty as you had thought. Gossamer strands connect each mind to every other mind and to your own shielded space. Nothing is truly isolated here, not even you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You sense the connections every mind has with every other mind, and with your own shell. This shield was built to protect your identity while remaining connected to the rest - or perhaps it's impossible to exist here *without* being connected.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As soon as you touch it, words and pictures form in the air above it. It's some kind of information cube recording your memories.

It's easy to scan through the information it currently holds. It chronicles your fall and your experiences with the Specter and the Sorrow, like a kind of journal.

They should be easy to wear.</DefaultText>
