      <DefaultText>It's a stasis chamber, exactly like the one from the ghostly woman's memories. There are no controls on it anywhere, nothing that could help you raise the floors to reach the depths of the Labyrinth.

A woman lies inside, clearly visible through the shimmering energy field and looking as though she were asleep. Her features are exactly those of the ghostly woman.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You *did* summon me," she says, intuiting your thoughts. "I can discern your memories more clearly than the others, even more clearly than my own."

She looks sadly down into the chamber. "But I remember now. This is who I was - the daughter of the Changing God."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"*He* was the father who tried to save me after the siege of the Tabaht. He discovered how to transfer consciousness - *my* consciousness - into a new body, hoping it would save me, but it didn't. My sickness followed me, in my mind. So he put me in there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was long ago, after the Tabaht had laid siege to Sagus Cliffs. My father fought them off, and I was among the survivors, but... I didn't exactly survive. One of the Tabaht's weapons made me sick somehow, in my mind. He discovered how to transfer consciousness - *my* consciousness - into a new body, hoping it would save me, but it didn't."

She places a hand on the surface of the chamber. "My sickness followed me, in my mind. So my... father put me in there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He tried to find a cure for me, and when that failed he tried to bring me back from death itself. He thought I was unconscious in there, but I remember. The memories are fragmented, but they're there. I was aware of everything, and with so many new memories flooding my mind, I'm able to fill in the gaps I *didn't* know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyebrows scrunch together, then she shakes her head. "I don't think so. I had my own consciousness, like my father does. This is who I *was*. Now I'm probably just a memory, stored forever in the Labyrinth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Considering he had centuries to do it? Not very often. A lot at first, then... only when he remembered or had some new idea. He used the probability engines underneath Sagus Cliffs to birth women with my personality. He tried to use Heaven's Rejoinder - his means for turning back defeats in the Endless Battle. Once, he tried to kidnap a version of me from an alternate reality, but she died in a tragic accident. He never tried *that* again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can't tell you in time measurements. I only know I was in the tank until the Sorrow attacked us. My father fled, saving himself." She laughs once, but there is no humor in it. "Maybe he figured he could bring me back even without my body. It's the kind of thing he would assume."

Her face darkens. "Maybe he didn't care."</DefaultText>
