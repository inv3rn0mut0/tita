      <DefaultText>The figure before you looks almost exactly like you, but a woman instead of a man. She doesn't bear your scars, but otherwise her face is like a mirror.

"Hello," she says pleasantly. "You must be me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, I'm a short-lived version of you." She looks you up and down. "Basically. Our creator used these cloning stations to rapidly prototype different body types and features before deciding on a final shell for his consciousness." She looks at the control panel. "These look different from the controls I remember. It looks like I'm stuck on the most recent settings."

She flashes you a smile. "Not that that's a bad thing, of course. I'm sure *you* won't mind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh! That's the most interesting part. Our creator always liked to process things externally, to have someone to talk to. He constructed assistants all the time. *I* was enabled to maintain my memories from version to version. That way I could provide more useful feedback on how one body moved or felt compared to another. Our progenitor would even have me perform tasks from time to time - sometimes mundane, sometimes dangerous. The fact that I could learn from my mistakes was a great help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs. "Our progenitor was funny like that. Gender for the next self was always a last minute decision. Our creator was never content with one - or even two! - genders. It was a fungible thing. He would constantly explore and experiment, even trying varjellen, ghibra, and diruk bodies at different points."

She stops, looking more thoughtful. "You know, even after centuries with our creator, I can't explain the fastidiousness about gender. It's just the way he is."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our creator always waited until the last minute to choose the gender of the next self, and he always had trouble with the decision. Most likely, he set me to female as the prototype, then switched again at the last minute when making you."</DefaultText>

She looks back at you. "It's like a nightmare version of the laboratory I know - as if somebody described the lab to a visitant that didn't quite understand it all, and then that visitant tried to recreate it." She shakes her head. "I don't know."</DefaultText>
