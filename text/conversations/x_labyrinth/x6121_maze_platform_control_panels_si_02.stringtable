      <DefaultText>The map on this control panel is fully functional. The platform you are standing on pulses with an orange glow, showing the floors in their current state. Touching the platform on the screen should shift the floors.</DefaultText>

Next to the map of the room is an image of a human figure in dotted outline. It glows like the image of the platform, awaiting input.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The panel is healed, but dim. The Changing God's daughter has taken control over this fathom. The panel's function is unnecessary.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The blast tears through your mind like a callerail. Your head burns with pain as searing images cross your vision.

      <DefaultText>You are expelled with great force from a black, chitinous tube. The earth is far, far below you, but rising fast. Suddenly a tendril of fire pierces your mind and everything goes black.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are writhing on an obsidian floor. Several fire wights tower over you, stretching out their arms, painfully consuming your life force. You flee, leaving that body to its fate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stand in front of a red, soulless portal. Your mind *aches* from the agony of consumed, tortured minds, but it was worth it. With the gate opened, you will be able to hide from the Sorrow.

You step beyond and are immediately brought to your knees as some presence *crushes* your mind. It's not just the souls you have eaten, but something *using* those souls.

It's too much. It will destroy you. You abandon the body in that endless space beyond the gate. You will find another way.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You float through the deep night beyond the world. Pieces of your vessel spin through the space beside you, flayed apart by the claws of the terrible merhj.

You look down at the masks arrayed across your chest. None can save you if they return. This body was a waste. You leave it, returning to the Ninth World.

As your consciousness rises away from the body, you recognize the masks as those belonging to the First.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You run through the desert seeking the village. The teratomorphs will have caught your scent already. There is no need for stealth.

Your chest burns with each breath, but finally you reach it, a haphazard cluster of stone and straw huts. You call out, but they're empty. Where have all the villagers gone?

A heavy force slams you to the ground. You cry out in pain as the teratomorph shreds your back like paper. Then you are gone. Let them have the body. You will find another.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You struggle against the rubbery grip of the ghibra. Mazzof is being carried next to you, either unconscious or uncaring - it doesn't matter which.

Using their spears for force, they propel the two of you into the cell and slam the hatch shut.

"How long?" you shout at them. "You never gave us a sentence!"

A gilled face leers in the porthole. "You don't have a sentence, air-breathers. You're never leaving."

You flee that body without another thought. You have better things to do.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tiny needles puncture your fingers. There is a flash from the circular synth plate next to the panel, and a finger-long blade in its center starts spinning and humming around its axis. As it spins, it projects a three-dimensional image very similar to yourself.

Your own body flickers in and out of phase. The blade spins faster, brighter. Your body's flickering accelerates, until finally the blade dissolves and standing on the platform is a fully grown human that looks remarkably like you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You brace yourself this time. The needles puncture your fingers again, and the blades begin spinning. Your own body flickers in and out of existence.

Soon the process is complete, and your clone stands on the platform watching you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Specter's voice booms from below. "There's no reason this should be *easy* for you."

You hear a great shout from the depths, and suddenly your mind is buffeted with a powerful blast of Tidal force.</DefaultText>
