      <DefaultText>Her old argument concluded - perhaps to her memory's satisfaction - the First stands here, waiting for you to speak. Something about her seems different, insubstantial, and she does not flinch as you reach out to touch her.

Nothing. Your hand passes through her. She isn't real - at least not solid.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memory of the First Castoff stares evenly at you, awaiting your questions.</DefaultText>

      <ID>3</ID>
      <DefaultText>You have walked into the middle of an argument. Neither of the speakers acknowledges your presence; their concentration is fully engaged with the other.

One of them looks like Andronus, the castoff from Miel Avest, but he carries himself very differently - confident, haughty. This must be Andronus before he was cast off.

The other is the First Castoff as you saw her in the Memovira's Fortress - but noticeably less scarred and beaten. A younger version.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The conversation picks up as if it had never left off. Anger, recrimination.... you've heard all this before.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sighs. "I am not withholding it. There's no reason for you to seek rebirth as I have done. When my technology is perfected, you will be reunited with me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She whispers, "Are you *still* trying to save her? After all these years? Really? Look at me. *Look at me*. I'm alive. All your children are alive. She's dead. She's been gone for centuries."</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>He falls silent, retreating deep into a reflective stillness. At last he says, "I haven't forgotten the fear of death. I live with it every day, with the reminder of what it has taken from me. Don't you realize that everything I do is in service of gaining it back? It's not just for me."

His face hardens. "What do you think you are to me, anyway?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You have a daughter?"</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her voice heavy with frustration, fraught and pleading.

"They call you a god, but your divinity is a joke. You *lied* to me. You never intended to get me a new body, did you? You were going to let me help you as long as you needed, and then you were going to cast me aside... just like you cast my body aside when you were done with it. And for *what*?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, Maralel." His tone is patronizing. "Have you come to tell me about the followers you've gained? Come to implore me to change my mind? Did you think to *threaten* me?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>The argument repeats, word for word. Your sire asks again whether the First is going to threaten him, and again he claims that all the castoffs are a piece of himself that he will integrate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She snarls, "You *have* a daughter. Right here! The one *you're* talking about has been dead for centuries, but I - *I* am flesh and blood. I am alive and begging for your help to stay that way!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>The argument plays out exactly as it did before - a shocking lack of empathy, followed by your sire's declaration that you all owe your existence to his failed quest to save his daughter.</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>She throws her hands in the air. "Stop arguing! This isn't real - it can't be! You were a *father* to me, but I see now what you really are. You are a narcissist. You have forgotten the fear of death."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>Again, she asks who he is, accusing him of forgetting death. He responds exactly as he did before.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>The illusion shatters. She startles and stares at you for a moment before dissolving into wisps of dream and memory.

The portal opens, beckoning you further into the Labyrinth. Its grasp is undeniable. The Changing God remains.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I can't stand by while you withhold the power for us to rejuvenate ourselves."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs and smiles. "You know the way out as well as I do, Maralel. You can leave at any time."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>She pauses for a moment, as if thinking, and then, "Whose daughter do you think I am? What are you even talking about?"

{SCRIPT: First is speaker}</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, Maralel," Andronus - or rather the Changing God - says. "I gave you my reasons, and I have had enough of explaining myself to you."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her eyes burn through the blank stare of her porcelain mask. "I've aided you in your researches, uncovered secrets of the Tides you never knew, would never have figured on your own. I'm twice the thinker you a-"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You are an *accident*! I won't deny the advantages your awareness provides, but do not deign to suggest we are anything like equals."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs, supremely uninterested in her reaction. "You're a part of me that's forgotten itself. You'll see. When I gather you back - all of you - and restore my daughter, then everything will be clear. You'll have that new body. Mine."

He frowns. "But right now, Maralel, you're interrupting me. You're distracting me from my work."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>The argument repeats, word for word. Your sire claims that all the castoffs are a part of him, mentions his daughter, and the First - Maralel - accuses him of lying to her - to all of them - before realizing he does not believe castoffs exist separately.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her voice becomes flat and furious. "Wait. Are you saying that we're all just pieces of you? That we're a part of *you*?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Your last castoff believes in what I'm doing. I no longer need your approval."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're right. We are just pieces of your mind. I'm sorry I ever doubted you."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>This is Andronus's face, with the sardonic eyes of your creator, but something about him seems different, and he does not flinch as you reach out to touch him.

This isn't the real Andronus, but a fabrication.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>She blinks several times, her eyes suddenly clear. The illusion is shattered. She startles and gapes at you.

The Changing God's avatar dissolves into dust and memory, as if it had never existed at all. A portal opens where he stood, beckoning you further into the Labyrinth. Its grasp is undeniable.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Paj?" Her head tilts back in surprise. "No. As you may have noticed, I was trapped in my own special prison."

She looks at you a moment longer, tapping her fingers on the chin of her mask.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>Then she turns abruptly and strides to the portal. Without turning around, she says, "Thank you." Then in a brief flicker of light, she's gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mm." She seems unconvinced. "Well. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. But it doesn't change anything."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She blinks several times, her eyes suddenly clear. The illusion is shattered. She startles and gapes at you.

      <DefaultText>The look of empathy and compassion has disappeared from his face. "You're not my daughter. You're a creation. You're a shell. Do you feel shame when you discard your old clothes? Do you feel pity when a doll burns?"

      <DefaultText>He leans back. "I don't hate you, Maralel. I don't despise you. But you need to look at this from my perspective." He breathes out softly, trying to open himself.  

"I am trying to restore the one person who ever meant anything to me. And when you insist that you're more important than that, I react poorly. But I assure you, you will live through me. If she lives again, it is only because I have never stopped trying."</DefaultText>

He gestures around. "All of this equipment. All of the castoffs. They're all just byproducts of what I began long ago. I *must* finish what I started."</DefaultText>
