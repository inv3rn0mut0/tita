      <DefaultText>The woman strides toward you, all confidence and grace. She has none of the fear and awkwardness you remember.

And yet the eyes are still Rhin's. The fear is gone, but the bright spark of innocence and joy is still there. Brighter, even. She squeezes your shoulder with a firm hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When she laughs, it's like a song, like the sun bursting out from behind the clouds. "Yes. Yes, it's me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When she laughs, it's like a song, like the sun bursting out from behind the clouds. "I should hope so! It's been, what, ten, twenty years?" She shakes her head. "I can't even remember."

Her face softens and she squeezes your arm. "But I'm still me. I grew up, but I'm still that little girl you rescued all those years ago."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She cocks her head in the unique way Rhin used to, looking at your pack. "You're still carrying Tehria, aren't you?" 

Your expression seems to amuse her. She laughs and says, "That god of finding I gave you, remember? Gods about, I can't believe he was strong enough. I was just a kid when I made him, and it doesn't look like you've aged much at all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well... Thank you. You really helped there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But we're in my mind... Your god helped you find me here?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I appreciate it, but I would've been fine without your help."</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods with pride. "He's a more powerful god than either of us knew. I can't take credit, though. I hardly knew what I was doing." She smiles. "I just knew I wanted to see you again. Tehria is what came of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's good to see you again, Rhin."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen. "No, thank *you*! You saved me when no one else would, at a time in my life when I needed it most."

She smiles. Something gleams in the corner of one eye. "I don't know what I would've done without you. This... this is nothing. The least I can do."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs again, loud and full of music. "Of course you would have," she says. It's difficult to tell if she's joking or not. "But you must have scared poor Tehria, because he called me here - across the worlds and into your mind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She smiles, as warm and bright as the sun. "It's good to see you too, old friend. I think about you all the time."</DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks anxiously over her shoulder, as though someone had called her name. "I can't stay," she says. She turns to face you. "I'm sorry, but I can't. I *am* glad I got to see you one more time, though."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Will we ever meet again?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Now that you're here, why can't you stay?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I might need your help in there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wait! How have you been? What has your life been like?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ha! I wasn't just sitting around waiting to rescue you, you know. I was actually in the middle of something."

She adjusts her pack and glances over her shoulder again. "Anyway, this is your world, not mine. You know that."</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm sure you will. Ahl can *feel* what's in there, and even he's shivering." She pats a tarnished medallion on her belt. "But my fight is elsewhere."

She cocks her head to the side, a mannerism you recognize all too well. She smiles. "Ahl says you'll be fine so long as you trust yourself."

She leans in and says in a stage whisper, "I'd listen to him. He's a very wise god."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her bright laughter rolls through the room. "Good. The life you returned me to has been good! I wish I could stay and chat, but we *both* have more important things to do. I wasn't just sitting around waiting to rescue you, you know. I was actually in the middle of something."</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I hope so. Keep Tehria on you, and we'll see." She adjusts her pack and glances over her shoulder again. "But even if we don't, you will always be with me. I wouldn't be who I am without you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly she lunges forward and throws her arms around you. It's amazing how tall she is - taller than you, even. She kisses you on the cheek. When she pulls back and smiles, her tears are barely noticeable.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"{In awe; she's seeing someone she loved, that she hasn't see since she was a kid}Damn. You haven't changed at all. You're *exactly* like I remember you. {Collecting herself; remembering her manners, but said with a smile}I mean warmth and welcome on your road, stranger."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Farewell, my friend. My home and hearth and bread are forever yours."

A portal opens suddenly. The bright light and trees you remember from before spill out of it. She waves one last time and turns to step through it.</DefaultText>
