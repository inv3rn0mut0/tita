      <DefaultText>Glowing, moving images paint the cliffside. Recognizable forms dance in blocky, stilted motions. Unknown animals mill around human figures, wandering in and out of caves carved into cliffs reminiscent of those in the area.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Figures around the rock wall continue to move. As before, four pictograms dominate the tableau: two warring groups of pentagon-headed forms inside a burning ring, two similar figures arguing inside a circle, a placid but primitive village, and that same village razed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Carefully examining each portion of the wall, you are able to discern that some artifact under the surface is making the stone itself become luminscent by passing energy through it. That energy flow is at its highest amplitude in the center, aligning with the link between the pair in the flaming ring and the battling groups. You slide your hand between those two pictograms.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The first shows two warring groups of people with pentagonal heads inside a ring of fire. The second shows a man and a woman of the same design arguing inside a circle. The next shows a village: a cave, a hearth, and a small group of round-headed people. The last shows those same people dead and bleeding, the cave crumbled, the hearth extinguished.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Figures around the rock wall continue to move, except for the three you've locked in place. Yellow glowing lines connect the image of the serene village to the two pentagonal figures arguing inside the ring and then the image of the warring group in the burning ring. Only one image remains unconnected.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Four images in particular stand out among the rest. They're larger and animate more smoothly; filament thin yellow lines streak between them. Moving your hand near the petroglyphs, those connections between them illuminate. These can be used to link the images, but the proper sequence is a mystery.</DefaultText>
