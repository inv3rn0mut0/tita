      <DefaultText>[You attempt to establish a connection to the reflection, but find you cannot. The other connections you have established have pushed you to your limit.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A bottle forms in his hand. He passes it to you, and you share its contents. A wave of tipsy contentment washes over you, and you feel your body's muscles subtly adjusting to the memories and experiences Artaglio's reflection offers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bottle vanishes from Artaglio's hand. The warmth and camaraderie you shared vanishes as well, and for a moment you feel an aching, lonely cold in its place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hazy form of Artaglio, the captain of the Irregulars, stands here. He's staring around the Calm, as if trying to place what he's doing here. He holds up his hands and stares at them, *through* them.</DefaultText>

He laughs and speaks, but his voice is muffled, indistinct. Your connections with the other reflections seem to hamper communication with him. If you concentrate, you can still make out his words.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something... something has happened on an instinctual level. You've established a bond with Artaglio and created a reflection of him in your mind. Some of the reflection's gifts are yours, and you feel stronger for it. 

However, this bond fully occupies a corner of your mind. You may be able to forge connections with more than one reflection in the Labyrinth, but not many. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The warmth of your bond remains strong. He feels your gaze upon him, and he raises the bottle in a silent toast.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes are on you, insistent and demanding, and he reaches a hand out toward you. "Come on, castoff. Share a drink. Let's get to know each other."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You tell me, castoff." He gestures broadly. "Does this look like the sort of place where *anyone* is happy?" He sighs. "At least I'm not in the Bloom anymore."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He thinks, his eyes squinting shut. "I'm remembering wars and women and laughter. One time we rolled into a town that was supposed to be hostile and they threw us the biggest party. After a while, we all got blackout drunk, even our sentries. We woke up stark naked in the morning, surrounded by mud as far as the eye could see. No sign of the town - no buildings, no inhabitants - and we never could find it again."

His face falls. "Lost my favorite boots there, too."</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What a place you have here, castoff. Do all of you have one of these in your heads?" He leans in. "I'm hearing all kinds of whispers, you know? Like... there's more in here than we can see."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So... winding up in a place like this is *not* what I was expecting when I decided to fight you." 

He's mastered his anger, it seems. "If this is to be my fate, I might as well make the best of it."</DefaultText>

He scowls and gestures, but his voice is muffled, indistinct. Your connections with the other reflections seem to hamper communication with him. The lines on his face soften, and he shrugs, resigned.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He leans in to shout something in your ear, but you cannot make out his words. Disgusted, he shrugs and looks away.</DefaultText>
