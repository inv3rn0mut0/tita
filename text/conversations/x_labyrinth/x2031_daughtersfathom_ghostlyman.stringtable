      <DefaultText>The ghostly woman's father works frantically, turning dials, stripping metal wires, attaching and detaching various pieces within the machine. After each change, he places a hand on the side of the machine, speaks some words, and gestures in the air.

He doesn't seem to notice you at all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No," he says, but he doesn't appear to be speaking to you. "That's not right. Her hair was softer, thinner. Her eyes more like caramel."

He speaks to the machine again, swipes through the air rapidly, then sticks his hands inside the engine and rearranges several delicate parts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What?" He whirls around, his eyes bright with fury. "Turn it *off*? That would kill her, *kill* her, do you understand? I'm so close to bringing her back. It's just a matter of tuning the machine correctly."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, my daughter is..." He starts to point at the ghostly woman, then takes a closer look at her. "Are you truly dead?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You think I'm just some tinkerer of numenera, or perhaps a mere lacuna of memory stuck in your mind."

His grin becomes manic. "Yes, I know what I am and where I am. *I* may not be real, but *she* is." He points at the ghostly woman beside you. "She *is* my real daughter, and I will bring her back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Despondently, he says, "Watch."

He places his hand on the side of the engine and says the word 'neshu.' Suddenly, a glowing interface appears in the air. He presses five symbols in a specific sequence. He performs the ritual a second time, and then the machine grows quiet and dim.

The ghostly man begins to fade. To the woman, he says, "I only wanted to set things right."

Then he is gone.</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What? No. That's impossible. The machine only works with personalities, memories, it can't possibly..."

He looks between you and the ghostly woman, despair growing on his face. Finally his shoulders sag. "You're telling me the truth. I know it. A part of me has always known it. I thought it was just a kink, something I could work out, but now I see..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His face darkens. "I *won't* shut it down, and you will not force me."

Although he makes no signal or gesture, the Tabaht soldiers from the other side of the fathom run to his aid. Somehow, this ghostly construct's anger has summoned them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He waves you off. "Bah. You're guessing! You don't know the side effects any more than I do, but I *do* know this will bring her back to me. Now leave, or I will force you to leave!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What? No, I..." For a moment, he seems to believe you. In that moment, one of the Tabaht warriors winks out of existence.

But it doesn't last. "No. You're wrong."</DefaultText>
