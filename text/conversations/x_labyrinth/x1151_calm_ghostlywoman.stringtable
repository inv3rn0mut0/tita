      <DefaultText>A spectral figure stands in front of you, but it's not the Specter. She looks familiar but you can't... wait! It's the ghostly woman from the Fifth Eye. She looks around her, confusion apparent on her face.

Her eyebrows rise high in some sudden realization. "It has begun."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The familiar figure of the ghostly woman looks around her, seemingly even more confused than when you first encountered her here in your mind.

      <DefaultText>"You're a... castoff," she says, as though confirming it to herself. "A spark of life leftover when your body was otherwise abandoned."

She looks up and around her, as though able to see something you cannot in the black expanse. "They're *all* here. The spark, the consciousness, of every living castoff is here now, in the Labyrinth. They were drawn here by the resonance chamber."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shuts her eyes. "There is a place called the Resonance," she intones. "A door in the deepest fathoms."

Eyes still closed, she points to a new portal that wasn't there before. "The Resonance lies through there. You must find it. *Your* body is the key. Open it. Enter it. Then you can stop the Sorrow and be free."

{ADAM: If I get permission to revise, I'd rather this say something about the player "receiving all the combined power of every castoff" or something, just so it doesn't feel so much like they're stopping the Sorrow in the Fortress and then have to do it all over again here.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, the ground and even the sky shake violently. You clutch your head in pain, as though someone had pounded on the inside of your skull.

Gradually, the pain subsides. The air stills and quiets, but the ghostly woman's eyes are wide, her mouth agape.

"He's already there! The Changing God has broken through to the doorstep of the Resonance! He'll have to force the door open though. You have time to reach him - to *stop* him." She looks gravely into your eyes. "But not much time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She cocks her head to the side. "Because you are the last castoff," she says, as though it were obvious. "Every castoff who has met you tells me the same things.
