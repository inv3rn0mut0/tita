      <DefaultText>His arms fold and extend in peaceful undulations as he drones a language you do not understand. Motes of light float around his hands. His eyes meet yours, "It is a complex esotery I devised to protect against the Sorrow. I regret I was never able to make it strong enough for *that* creature, but perhaps it will be able to aid us here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You watch his arcane gestures and listen carefully to his words. The ritual is vastly complex, but you begin to recognize a pattern within it. Perhaps you could help him complete the ritual faster.</DefaultText>

Diviaticu notices your attention. "You understand? Perhaps you can assist. With two of us, we might complete the ritual more quickly."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His gestures, swimming through the burgeoning energies surrounding the nano, are complex and arcane. His words, likewise, seem to hold no meaning.

"You do not need to understand," he says, intuiting your thoughts. "Go. Fend it off while I complete the ritual."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your arms swim through the air, matching the nano's movements. The motes of light form an arabesque connecting you, glowing brighter than before. "Elegant, this esotery, is it not? Together we can complete it more quickly. But return your attention to the fight for now. I will continue until we have succeeded."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Listening to Diviaticu's incantation, you pick up the pattern of syllables he utters and devise a counter melody. The motes flash and shimmer as your voices coalesce. "Thank you, that sped the process greatly. I'm afraid another verse would create too much energy for me to conduct, though."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You listen for a rhythm, a pattern to begin your incantation, but the nano's speech is too difficult to decipher. You are unable to help.</DefaultText>
