      <DefaultText>You stand in front of a rusted door. The air is humid and dank. You've had a moment's respite from this water-logged hell, a bubble of stale air your resting point. You've breathed water before, and you've lived decades beneath the waves, but this body's an air-breather and the constant pressure has been crushing you ever so subtly. Worse, your companion's mind seems to be wandering from the task at hand.

He's a genius with machines, as you well know, but now he seems... distracted.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The device in his hands is covered in knobs, wires, and antennas. He believes it can get the two of you through the corroded door, but he's merely staring at it. Perhaps he's lost faith in his invention, but that is hardly your concern. This mission cannot be delayed. It must proceed. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your words echo clearly, and he looks up, surprised, as you cut through his indecisive daze. He grimaces, and says, "All right. We'll be through the door before they catch up."

His fingers make minute adjustments to the knobs and blinking levers of the device, and the stale air of your bubble freshens as the door swings open. A dark hallway lies beyond, a passage that links the water-bordered cells and the aquatic viewing areas - what you seek lies there.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your shouted words seem muffled in the stale air. Your companion flinches away from you. "Sorry. I just wanted to be sure I hadn't made a mistake."

      <DefaultText>You mumble a few words, drawing power from the air around you until a solution appears in your mind. You snatch the device from his hands, rewire it, and shove it back at him.

"Oh," he says, examining your work. "Sorry. I was trying to improve the thing."

He waves the device at the door, and the stale air of your bubble freshens as the door swings open. A dark hallway lies beyond, a passage that links the water-bordered cells and the aquatic viewing areas - what you seek lies there.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His fingers make minute adjustments to the knobs and blinking levers of the device, and the stale air of your bubble freshens as the door swings open. A dark hallway lies beyond, a passage that links the water-bordered cells and eases into the aquatic viewing areas. 

That's your destination. What you seek lies there.

      <DefaultText>The air thickens with each step you take towards this watery orb, and whispering voices flit across one of the countless, aching gaps in your mind. This must be one of the memories you were told to find. 

Two figures swim down through the orb, as though it is a fathomless ocean. One vanishes into the ebony depths before you can study it. The other, a male, seems to be struggling... or perhaps, drowning. 

You realize that - like the swimmer - you cannot breathe. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memory begins to fade, as if you were being drawn backward through a tunnel, and you hear more pylons rising from the pit. 

Something is wrong. The events within the orb have settled into that gap in your mind, but the edges of it are rough, as though the memory itself is not truly yours. 

There's something else - a gust of sour air pulling at you, like a predator inhaling the scent of its prey at the far end of a dark, whispering field. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Moments later, you're underwater again, your hands closing around a strange yet familiar artifact - you need it to complete... something. It hovers above a pedestal, rotating in the dark water.

An electric current runs through your fingers as your hand crosses the vertical plane of the pedestal, and an iridescent field coalesces so fast that the wave of pressure dazes you for a moment. The rising pulse of a sonar alarm ripples through the water. 

The guards won't be far behind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The water is crystal clear around you as you kick away from the pedestal. Your companion hangs motionless in the water, too far for you to reach before the guards arrive. You stroke for the hallway through which you entered and, emerging into the air, you race for the great door.

The sounds of something breaching the surface behind spur you to greater speeds, but you fear you're not fast enough.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You focus on the cloudy base of the pedestal. Your fingers instinctively find the control panel for the jeweled force field, almost as if you had built it in the first place. You remove it, casting it to the side, and you reach inside to deactivate the crystals that power both the pulse and the pedestal. As you remove them, a scaly hand falls on your shoulder. 

Your head whips around, and you see... only the inky blackness of a piscine eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You run urgent fingers over the devices fastened to your waist, a fog rising in your mind. A few can be used against the guards, but will also turn your skin to synthsteel, or the surrounding water to boiling wax. Hardly ideal. 

Finally, you find a small silver sphere. Setting the sphere in place, you kick desperately for the safety of a nearby alcove.</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>The sphere whirls and unfolds into a spiraling vortex. The sphere at its center speaks a few polite words in an ancient language, then begins draining the surrounding water into itself with alarming speed. The approaching guards shout, then scream as they, too, are sucked into the whirlpool and ripped to pieces.

You allow yourself a fleeting smile, but are all too aware that more alarms are going off in the distance...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You plunge your hands into the warm surface of the orb, and slowly, inexorably, tear it open.

As you do, you feel stronger - something about this place causes even your smallest choices to shape who you are.

Suddenly, a memory floods your mind...

      <DefaultText>Your fingers scrabble for purchase on the smooth surface of the orb as the air in your lungs dwindles. Finally, just before you lose consciousness, you make a tiny scratch in the orb's surface.

Even so, you feel yourself getting stronger - something about this place causes even your smallest choices to shape who you are.

      <DefaultText>You cannot so much as make a single scratch the orb's smooth surface. Airless lungs aching, you sink to your knees, then fall on your side. Red-tinged black closes over the edges of your vision as you watch the tiny swimmer reach the bottom of the orb, and pierce it.
