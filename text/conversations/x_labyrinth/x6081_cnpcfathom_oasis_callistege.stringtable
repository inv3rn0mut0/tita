      <DefaultText>Callistege floats motionless, staring into the distance. Her echoes are likewise motionless, all of them arrayed in various poses like broken and discarded dolls, all of them staring at the same point in space.

Nothing you say elicits any response. When you reach out to touch her, to shake her from her stupor, you see that her hands are clenched into fists and her body is trembling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you touch her, you're moved in time and space to... somewhere else. Images flash in front of your eyes, a cascade of other places and other times and other worlds that barely resolves from a blinding blur. You clutch at a single image, letting it bear you down into the endless chaos...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A figure lies before you, wrapped in bandages from head to toe. Various numenera surround the bed, along with various medical implements. Intermittently, sharp, wheezing breaths emanate from the bandage across the figure's mouth. Through the only gap in the cloth Callistege's eyes are visible, wide and frightened. She sees you and croaks out a single word.

"Please..." She takes another wheezing breath. "Don't..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are in darkness. There's no feeling, no light, no air.

"What are we going to do with her?" The voice comes from all around you, through you, part of you.

"She's too dangerous." The same voice, the same tone. A sick feeling of dread rises with each word.

"The containment field won't last much longer."

"Do it."

Right beside your ear, Callistege screams.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Help me!" Callistege is braced against the edge of a cliff-face, one arm fused to a taut length of synthsteel that stretches into the abyss beyond. She slips forward a few inches and screams wordlessly, tearing at the synthsteel with her fingernails. Blood runs down her hand  as she tries to pare metal from flesh, to no avail.

"Help!" She looks at you, right through you, frenzied, panicked. She loses her footing and lands on her back, skidding toward the edge with a blood-curdling scream.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't do this." Callistege is leaning toward a figure seated in a chair, her forehead resting on theirs. "Don't shut me out again."

She steps backward and slaps the figure, her body rocking with the force of it. The sound persists unnaturally, echoing in the corners of the room as though seeking an escape. The figure does not move.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Callistege floats in front of you, eyes open and staring. Hair gently caresses her sallow cheeks, her ice-blue lips. Her right hand is frozen mid-grasp, her last action forever incomplete.

A sepulchral whisper worms its way into your mind.

 "... I'm still here..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A guttering fire throws fitful shadows across the room, illuminating five mechanical arms and, below them, something hulking and faceted. Callistege warms her hands beside the fire, casting fearful glances at the darkness.

From far away, a hollow pinging reaches the chamber. In an instant, Callistege is on her feet, fleeing into the writhing dark, the tenuous safety of the fire already forgotten.

{SFX: Terrifying hollow pinging, i.e. the first sound we hear from the Balrog in the FotR?}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Callistege is slumped in a chair, an empty syringe embedded in her arm. Her hand falls limply from the plunger as she turns to face you, staring you down through the bedraggled curtain of her hair.

A low buzzing fills the room, building from somewhere out of sight. Callistege opens her mouth and the noise becomes deafening, drowning out her animal utterances as she slides to the floor, her body a cacophony of palsied eruptions. Dark flies pour from her mouth and nose, obscuring everything but her eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Callistege stares at you. "Who are you?" She takes two steps forward, then gasps in pain and presses both hands to the side of her head.

"Who are you? Who are you?!" She falls to her knees, howling and clawing at her ears. Runnels of blood pour from them, pulsing in time with her heartbeat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No." Callistege is staring at a jagged piece of metal embedded in her left hand. She gingerly grasps it with her right and yanks it out, grunting with the effort but nothing else.

"No!" She drives the spike through her left wrist, staring at the wound in horror. She takes hold of the metal, driving it into her arm again and again, higher and higher, until she strikes bone and the blade escapes her nerveless grasp, clattering to the floor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Callistege raises her head, bringing you into focus with difficulty.

"I have... nothing." She opens her emaciated arms, and where the sunlight strikes her skin she dissolves into flakes of ash that drift lazily upward in the golden air.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Callistege lies on the bed, a skeleton draped in flesh. Each breath is laboured, growing weaker. She raises one trembling hand and drops it onto her sternum.

"I'm in here." She searches your face for an answer and, finding none, begins to cry.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The room is silent save for the crackle of flames. Callistege sits in front of a fireplace, holding a letter written on transparent paper. With a perfectly steady hand, she touches it to the flame, fire consuming the words in one incendiary moment.

She doesn't move as the flames lick at her sleeves, gradually taking hold and drawing plumes of acrid smoke from the folds of her dress.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You will not kill me." Callistege stares into your eyes, grasping at the hands wrapped around her neck. "You are not strong... enough..."

She gasps, complexion reddening as she continues to pluck ineffectually at the vice-like grip on her throat.

"You are not..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>You see an indistinct figure surrounded by voluminous pillows, enshrined in white sheets and all the makings of comfort. Callistege is standing at the end of the bed, her hands on the figure's feet. She rubs them for a moment longer, then stands, a small smile on her lips.

"See you soon." She turns to walk away, passing through you without a backwards glance, her expression inhumanly calm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A series of vases cover the mausoleum wall, each of them containing a few sprigs of greenery and a smattering of bedraggled wildflowers.

"It's never as much as you think it's going to be," Callistege says to a small wooden box at the base of the wall. She holds a golden flower, running the petals idly across her fingertips. Then she pulls the petals off, one by one, letting them fall to the rough stone floor where she crushes them underfoot.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're wrong." Callistege flings back her cloak, revealing an arm misshapen with pustules, oozing various fluids and reeking of necrotic flesh. "Tell me again that there's nothing you can do!"

She looks into your eyes and her defiant expression dissolves into blind terror.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Callistege stands with a box in her arms. Though she is trembling with fatigue, her voice shows no signs of it.

"And where, then, shall I go?" She listens to a reply only she can hear and the blood drains from her face. Stiff-backed and trembling all the more, she turns and walks slowly away into the darkness.</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>Callistege stands in the middle of a room filled with corpses, her arms stained with blood to the elbows, dark daggers glittering in her hands. As you become aware of her she spins to face you, her breathing growing louder and more raucous the longer she stares.

Then, she starts to laugh.</DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Get out!" Callistege charges at you from out of the darkness, gibbering in terror. She screams as she's hoisted bodily into the air by invisible hands, her limbs twisted beyond recognition into ropes of pulsating flesh. Her bloodshot eyes latch onto yours, her frenzied breaths ringing over and over in the too-small space as an unnamed, malignant presence crushes her skull.</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Where are we going?" Callistege is dressed in rags, bundled in the back of a cart. She raises a hand to the bandage across her eyes.

"Why can't I see?" The cloth falls away, the jellied mess of her eyes exposed to daylight. She probes gingerly at her face with her fingertips, reaches the cross-hatched remnants of her eyes, and starts to scream.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I never wanted it to be this way." Callistege holds your hand, gently, in hers. "I never wanted you to know this pain." She looks at you with a combination of love and sorrow that leaves her on the verge of tears. She pats your hand once, then withdraws.

"Farewell."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The illusion vanishes, and both you and Callistege are back in the Labyrinth. As one, her echoes turn to regard you, some decidedly more unfriendly than others.

Callistege herself is the last to look at you.

      <DefaultText>"You have a unique way of saving people, dear." She closes her eyes and tilts her face up. A flicker of pain crosses her features, then she takes a deep breath and meets your gaze levelly.

"So. I'm dead, yet somehow still here. What now?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You got me killed." Her words are as lifeless as stone. She inclines her head toward you gracefully.

"The *substance* of this psychic construct is positively *charged*. Whether it is your doing or simply the weight of the castoff minds, I cannot say. But I can say with some certainty that this place is capable of forming a connection to the datasphere."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You close your eyes and concentrate. You know the connection must exist - if not through you, then through another castoff. You feel something like a portal open within your mind, inside your *imagination*, a green and glowing aperture that flickers images and numbers. You can feel great minds moving on the other side, a vast ocean filled with mystery and wonder. A subsonic pulse thrums through it, and a bubble forms.

The edifice that rises from the depths of your mind is multi-tined and cave-like, descending further into the depths of the Labyrinth, beyond where you can see. You can feel great minds moving inside. A subsonic pulse thrums through it

      <DefaultText>Callistege's hand on your cheek is soft and cool. She stands corporeal in front of you, and also inside your dream-mind, surveying this new construction.

"It's much as I imagined," 

"If your sire's notes were correct..." She taps out a sequence on a panel that you can't see. The bubble glows from within, a light cascading over her like a waterfall, like smoke, as her sisters enter the imaginary sphere.

She starts to dissolve, silver light pouring out from beneath her skin and shattering her face into a thousand points of light that fade away, drawn like moths into the open aperture. The humming ceases, the light gives out, and Callistege's handprint is left on the glass, slowly fading away.

She is gone.</DefaultText>

"Well." Her tone is cautious. "There must be some way to make this work..." She presses a sequence on a panel you can't see. 

A glass pane closes her off from you, and the building rumbles.

Black smoke pours from the roof of the cave, falling down and smothering Callistege until you can't separate her from the darkness beyond.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You float in darkness, observing from a distance as Callistege manipulates controls in a small room surrounded by the void. As you drift away from her, another small room appears, identical to the first. Callistege stands in that room, too, her motions almost - but not quite - mirroring the first's.

Another appears, and another, until the darkness is filled with identical boxes, connected by gossamer strands of energy.

They become aware of each other at the same moment.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Very well, I will not ascend. Nor, however, will I continue any longer in this shattered state." She smiles weakly, her face pale. Tentatively, she reaches up to touch the Attractor through her sleeve.

"Can this be undone? If there are any doubts, turn back now." She's looking at you, but seems to be talking to herself. She searches for the clasp on the Attractor, her fingers trembling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In one quick motion, she snaps open the clasp and lets the Attractor fall away. She reaches into her satchel and removes the injection given to her by Demeray and Obervich. Her horrified sisters watch as she plunges it into arm and depresses the plunger.

Her echoes wink out of existence all at once, leaving her standing alone in the middle of a space that seems too large for who she now is. 

"I can still remember all our tricks, castoff. So don't worry that I've lost my edge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She raises her head and closes her eyes, breathing in deeply. A smile grows upon her lips until, with an exclamation of delight, she throws her arms wide open, laughing.

      <DefaultText>She tilts her head from side to side, as if listening for something. Then she turns her eyes on you.

"They're gone," she says. She grabs the Attractor, cradling it in her hands like a broken doll. Quickly, as if her hands are moving of their own volition, she stows it in her bag, then meets your gaze as if nothing had happened.

"Are you ready to go?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks behind her, tentatively passing a hand through the air. Then she looks at the Attractor, lying inert.

"We'll see if this was the best decision. It's certainly a *strange* one." Her tone is perhaps too bright. She scoops the Attractor into her bag. "Perhaps I shall get used to it, in time." Her eyes have a manic glow as she stands back up and steps toward you.

"For now, we'd better keep moving. Isn't that right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Callistege's hand appears on the glass, then is quickly snatched away. A grinding, metallic cacophony rises to a crescendo, shaking the walls of the Labyrinth and the glass door of the cave until, finally, it subsides.

The glass door slides open and inky black dust pours out like spilled wine.

She is gone.</DefaultText>
