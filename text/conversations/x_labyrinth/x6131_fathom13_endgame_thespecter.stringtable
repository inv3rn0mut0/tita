      <DefaultText>"I'd hoped you would open that for me. And here we are," the Specter says, and his voice is not tied to his body. It pours from the walls around you, from the shifting floor beneath your feet.

      <DefaultText>"I needed you to open the door, and you've done that. The cage, I can handle on my own."

His voice presses down on you like a hand, as if trying to drop you to your knees. "When I enter the Resonance, it will be to return my errant children to my mind where they belong. Leave me to it and we have no further quarrel. What say you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Irritation flashes across his translucent face.

"I'm not here to debate who I am or what I've done. I'm here to claim what's mine!" The ground rumbles menacingly beneath your feet.

      <DefaultText>"Our way. *Our* way." She stands back from you in wonderment. "After all you've done, you'd throw us over to him."

Disgust - and sorrow - hardens her face. "I can't beat you. I'd just be throwing my life away. Though I guess that's what you're doing anyway." She dismisses you with a wave of her hand. "Do what you want, but I'll have no part of it."

      <DefaultText>She doesn't scream. She doesn't so much as whimper. But this is your mind, and you feel her helpless rage and terror as she falls towards the distant floor. 

Then, crackling, shattering pain. 

Then, nothing. She's gone.

He rests his palm on yours, and a flood of memories comes pouring into your mind. You remember your daughter. The Tabaht, their forces besieging the city. The terrible illnesses they brought with them, the psychic warfare laid across the city.

You remember placing your daughter in stasis, the frantic researches, the discovery of the Tides.

... the Sorrow.</DefaultText>

      <ID>176</ID>
      <DefaultText>The early years were the hardest. Fleeing through dimensions, the Sorrow on your heels. Shifting backward through time, before the rise of the Tabaht and discovering the shadowy justice of the Black Cube, and the body you left behind to escape it. You remember perfecting the transfers. You remember traveling across the Ninth World, consulting with the Augurs of Sada Emidu. You recall your pride in the First Castoff (and how you laughed at that name! As if she *were* the first!).</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>177</ID>
      <DefaultText>You remember the rage she provoked, the fear that she would destroy you... and the pride with every gambit, for it was proof that *you* had untapped potential. Each of your castoffs, a new facet of your brilliant mind, changing the world.

And you realized how tragic it would be if all this were destroyed. You know now why the Specter went to such desperate lengths to preserve his - your - legacy.

When you open your eyes again, the Specter is gone. But he is a part of  you, forever.

      <DefaultText>"No. He is right, don't you see? Miika is the reason for all of this - the only reason any of you exist. You and I, we have all lived our lives, and done what? Miika, however, has done nothing. She has had no *chance* to do something."

He turns to his daughter. "I tried to be a good father to you and failed. And to them, the castoffs, I did not even try. But my failures end today."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She taps her lips with the flat of her blade. You don't know when the knife appeared in her hand. "We've all made a mess of it, haven't we?"

Her eyes narrow. "What makes you think she'll do any better? I mean, apart from competing against all the rest of us and running from the Sorrow and... all right. I see your point. At least she'll have a chance to shine. And her mistakes will be her own."

She throws the blade down to the floor. "Fine. Let's do it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lies!" She turns to you. "I don't know what drove you to agree with him, but I didn't come all this way to watch you bend over."

She points one strong finger at the Specter. "I've seen enough of what you've done - to your own offspring and others - to know you've got no interest at heart but your own. I know better than anyone your castoffs aren't always the greatest people. But they're *people*. They deserve choice and life."

She draws her weapon. "You're not taking *anyone* today."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you were truly this 'Changing God,' then this woman..." She points to the Changing God's daughter. "Even if this woman were just a memory, she should recognize you as her father. Don't you think?"

Rhin looks kindly on the ghostly woman, then back at the Specter. "But I saw it - I saw it on her face when you challenged her... You're a *stranger* to her."</DefaultText>
