      <DefaultText>Jumbled thoughts cloud your head as you study the empty bowl before you. Drops of liquid fall from the ceiling, spattering on the ground next to the bowl. The light from every drop is reflected in the bowl's rounded hollow, as if it *hungers* for that light, and *needs* to be filled. Yet the bowl remains dry.

Another drop falls from the ceiling and splashes across the pylons, wasted.
