      <DefaultText>The reflection before you resembles Erritis, but an unmistakably older one. No golden glow surrounds him. He is plain. Weathered. His hair is streaked with gray and white.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The older Erritis hasn't moved. He waits for you to speak, silent and shivering. Afraid. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dark, red light rises in his pale eyes. "That was a long time ago. Before the demons came out of the black box and filled me. Before I was CALLED TO ADVENTURE." 

The louder words tear themselves out of him, and he recoils from them, covering his ears. The glow ebbs from his eyes as suddenly as it came. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You found my herding stick," he murmurs, staring at the ground. "I put it down before I opened the black box and the demons came out. They filled every part of the alcove and they filled me up."

He takes a deep, shuddering breath. "Most of them are inside me now. Shouting and watching. You found the ones that were left, and they brought me here."

Tears fill the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes.

      <DefaultText>"Yes. I'm me. I'm the me that lived alone in the nameless field with his yol. He named them and tended them and clipped their yellow wool." A tear spills down his nose and drops to the ground.

      <DefaultText>"The other ones whisper. They watch. They're hungry." Indigo flickers at the center of his pupils, like a distant bonfire. 

*they want me to die*

      <DefaultText>"Herd creatures," he says, and a look of calm happiness drifts beneath his troubled face. "Soft, yellow wool. Milk and cheese."

Something like grief descends through his expression, devouring his brief happiness. "My herd is lost now. I think they're gone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One of my yol wandered into that dead valley," he says casually, but his hand is clenched at his side. "Its tracks went around the alcove, and I decided to sleep there for the night."

His fist is shivering. "I heard sounds inside a dark box on a shelf, and I opened it. And ever since, I've been buried by them. By the other me. Screaming and crying. Never sleeping." He rubs his eyes with dirty knuckles, like a child.

"I never found my yol. And now, I never will."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not until I wasn't one anymore," he says, dropping his head. "I lived in the nameless field where my mother was buried. I liked making songs in my head, but I hated that field. That leaky house."

He presses his fingers against his hollow cheeks. "I wanted to leave it all behind. To sing for people, for meals in distant taverns. But now I wish I could go back there. Sing to my animals and sleep where my mother slept." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Erritis - this timid, *realer* version of your companion - flinches as you approach. And yet...

      <DefaultText>Erritis's head snaps back with a *crack*. His arms shake, trapped at his sides. A dry rattling comes from deep in his throat.

Slowly, he looks back down at you. One pupil is a vast, flaming red. The other is a muted indigo. 

"YOU ARE SPEAKING WITH THE AUDIENCE," says countless booming, curious voices from Erritis's mouth. "WE ARE NOT SURE WHY. YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING THE HERO WITH THE REST OF US."</DefaultText>

"YOU CALLED US *named us*. WE ARE THE AUDIENCE *the voyeurs* NO, THAT'S THE WRONG WORD *the perfect word* STOP IT. YOU ARE WRONG AND WE ARE SPEAKING NOW."

The creatures in Erritis stretch his mouth into a merry grin. "WE ARE THE PARAGONS. WE CONTROL THE BODY. OUR HEROES MAKE THE WORLD A HOPEFUL PLACE!"</DefaultText>

A pause. "*actually, we would like to see that - * YES, WE KNOW YOU WOULD, BUT WE ARE RUNNING A PERFORMANCE HERE." 

The red eye gleams. "WILL YOU ACCEPT OUR BARGAIN OR NOT?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"*DONE*," the Audience says together, and the lights in Erritis's eyes whirls, growing wider, darker, and hotter - you can feel the heat coming off of Erritis's bony frame. 

Then, his eyes go dark from corner to corner, like sparklights with broken fuses. No pupils are there at all.

"WE OFFER YOU A NEW BARGAIN," the Paragons say at last. "WE WILL RECEDE *but not reduce*. WE WILL AVOID SHOUTING *we never shout* WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WE-US, NOT YOU-US *our apologies*."

Erritis folds his arms. "WE WILL SEE WHAT THE HERO MAKES OF HIMSELF WHEN WE DO NOT GUIDE HIS EVERY STEP. IS THIS AGREEABLE TO YOU?"</DefaultText>

The Paragons sigh. "OUR HEROES WERE HUNTED DOWN AND DESTROYED. OUR SWARM WAS TAMPERED WITH UNTIL WE COULD NO LONGER REPRODUCE. THEN, WE WERE SEALED IN A DARK PLACE UNTIL OUR HERO - YOUR HERO - FOUND US."
