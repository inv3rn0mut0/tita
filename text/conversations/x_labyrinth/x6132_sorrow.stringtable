      <DefaultText>The Sorrow is here in its full power, wearing the unquiet psyches of its victims like a tattered cloak. Filaments of light and energy leak from it, strange colors that correspond to no Tides you know. Its tendrils flutter and flap in an unseen breeze. 

"*You come before me at last, yet we have met so many times before.*" Its voice is a hissing multitude. One voice stands atop the rest, a woman's voice, soft and deep.</DefaultText>

{COLIN: Feel free to add however many responses you want here. The Sorrow should respond to each one based on the player's Tides, and Matkina and the First should also respond to it to show whether they are appeased by it. There should be at least one answer that appeases both of them.

In the responses above, I've found it's easiest to show Matkina/First appeasement before the Sorrow's answer, but then to let anyone who wants to protest do so after the Sorrow's reaction. It's probably easiest if every answer appeases at least one of them (so you don't have to deal with a double protest). -AH}</DefaultText>

In the responses above, I've found it's easiest to show Matkina/First appeasement before the Sorrow's answer, but then to let anyone who wants to protest do so after the Sorrow's reaction. It's probably easiest if every answer appeases at least one of them (so you don't have to deal with a double protest). -AH}</DefaultText>

{COLIN: Feel free to add however many responses you want here. The Sorrow should respond to each one based on the player's Tides, and Matkina and the First should also respond to it to show whether they are appeased by it. There should be at least one answer that appeases both of them.

In the responses above, I've found it's easiest to show Matkina/First appeasement before the Sorrow's answer, but then to let anyone who wants to protest do so after the Sorrow's reaction. It's probably easiest if every answer appeases at least one of them (so you don't have to deal with a double protest). -AH}</DefaultText>
