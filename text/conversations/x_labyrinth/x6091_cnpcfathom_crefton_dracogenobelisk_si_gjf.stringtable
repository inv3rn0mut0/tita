      <DefaultText>A heavy but somewhat familiar malevolence *bleeds* from the gray and gold depths of this stronglass pillar. A reptilian creature curls up around it, gripping the pillar with its muscular legs. 

Its hisses at the air, but its eyes - rows of them, like a spider's - are fixed on you, glittering.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You search your knowledge of the creatures inhabiting the Ninth World. This beast is not among them - of this, you are almost certain. 

'Almost', because a tale teases your memory - a tale of a foolish nano, and what happened to him when he believed the promises of a sinuous being trapped in a crack in reality itself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The air is thick and... strange around this monument, as if the being curving around this pillar does not belong here, and has taken part of its own reality with it into this one.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you watch, the creature slyly tightens its grip on the pillar,  ard enough to crack the glass and rip its skin. To tear into the juicy flesh beneath hiding the muscle of the - 

You blink once. Twice. The statue is just a statue. It is not alive. It is not tearing into the pillar. 

After a few moments of steady breathing, you are almost certain these things are true. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stare past the statue, into the depths of the stronglass pillar. A hot light pulses at its core - like a heart made of heat instead of living tissue. 

With each throbbing beat of that light, you are reminded of the man you met in the Bloom - Dracogen was his name, and for some reason, he and this monument are linked.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The eyes of the statue hold your gaze as you focus, slowing your breath, casting your mind back...

Yes. You have never seen this creature before, but other castoffs have. Many other castoffs. That must be why this statue is here, in the nexus of memories and lifetimes that is the Labyrinth. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memories trigger in painful succession, too *large* to stop. 

You see eyes - rows and rows of eyes - hanging high in the dark as you stammer out your request. 

You hear cruel laughter, echoing down a dripping hallway tainted with the stink of the Bloom. 

You feel a claw slam down upon you, pinning you jagged rock, pressing and pressing, crushing you bone by bone...</DefaultText>

With slow and deliberate care, the eyes swivel in their stone sockets and fix on you again. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out to touch one of the eyes. The statue doesn't move, and you hear nothing beyond the sound of your breath, and yet...

You feel something watching you from beyond this place. A sudden heat bakes the palm of your hand. 

Something tells you that defacing this statue is a bad idea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your fingertip scrapes across one of the gleaming eyes. You hear a slow, angry hiss before clawed hands close over your head from behind. And squeeze. 

The darkness closes and coils around you, crushing the air from your lungs. Shouted words from the beast strike your mind like misshapen, burning meteors. You try to scream, but nothing escapes. Nothing.

      <DefaultText>You reach out for the statue again. A blistering heat builds in the air around your hand, as if waiting to see if you'll be foolish enough to attempt the theft this time. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You awaken by inches, every joint aching. Something lies heavy and cold in your hand.

At first, you take the gem lying there for one of the statue's eyes. And then, you notice that the serpent is still as whole and untouched as before.
