      <DefaultText>You plant your hand on the icy floor and push, staggering up to your feet. Every inch of your body aches, as though you've been crushed in a massive hand. 

The Specter stands before you, impassive. It may be your imagination, but he seems more solid than before.

      <DefaultText>"A good question," he says. He seems taller than he did a moment before. "Once you give me my body back, your thoughts would be pushed to the back of my mind. It would be frightening for a moment. Disorienting, maybe, but not painful. And then, our thoughts would merge. You'd become a part of me again."

He spreads his hands. "And that's it. Now. Give me my body back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He lied. The pain is extraordinary. World-shattering. Every memory you've earned in your short life is examined, torn apart, and discarded. You dwindle as he expands, filling the corners of the body that was once yours. 

And yes, he lied. You do not join him. You do not find oblivion. You live on, mouthless, mindless, a helpless witness to the crimes he commits with your hands.

      <DefaultText>Tidal energy pours from the air around you, flowing into the Specter. The ground itself slips around your feet, holding you in place. You feel your grip on your body - your mind - slipping by fingerlengths. 

You are diminishing. He is winning. You search your mind - your hard-earned memories - for something that will loosen his hold on you.

      <DefaultText>Drawing breath, you shout the sharp, barbed words that once destroyed the people of ancient Qra. They tear themselves from you and lunge at the Specter, closing over his mind like a mouth full of yellow, jagged teeth.

He staggers, hissing, then plunges his hands into his head. One by one, the Specter pulls the words out and crushes them in his now-fading fists. </DefaultText>
