      <DefaultText>"I was alive when the Tabaht laid siege to Sagus Cliffs. My... father... fought them off. I was among the survivors, but I didn't exactly survive. One of the Tabaht's weapons made me sick somehow, in my mind. My father discovered how to transfer consciousness - *my* consciousness - into a new body hoping it would save me, but it didn't. So he put me in that chamber the one you just saw the Sorrow destroy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ghostly woman appears next to you. She stares at the door you just emerged from, her eyes as round as the moon. "I remember now. All of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He thought I was unconscious in there, while he tried to find a cure for me, but I was aware of everything."

She looks at the room around her. "After the Sorrow destroyed the stasis chamber, I woke up here. I wasn't *aware* though. Not for a long time. Not until you came and started changing things."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks at you. Her eyes are brighter now, full of confidence. "You are the last castoff, the one my father created to witness this place, to command it. You have been changing the Labyrinth since you were first born. *You* are the one who will decide our fate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You are the last castoff. You were *designed* for the Labyrinth. You've been changing things since you were born. Those changes have finally helped me remember who I am."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No," she says, firm and certain. "I am not a memory nor a reflection nor a lacuna. I am Miika, the full consciousness of the Changing God's daughter."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You tried. My father's adviser was just as self-centered as he was - it was his *self* after all." She gives you a half-hearted smile. "Maybe there are some realities you *can't* change."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course! You can change reality. It's what you've been doing all this time!"

She drops her chin to her chest. "Then again, maybe not. My father's adviser was just as self-centered as he was - it was his *self* after all. He might have teleported you to safety even if you had told him not to. I don't know. Maybe there are some realities you *can't* change."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A familiar voice cuts through the air, interrupting you both. "*You* don't need to do anything."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She points to the door on the opposite side of the fathom. "There is one more Mere. Enter it, open the Resonance and end this. For all of us."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You tried, which is more than I can say for my father. You risked your own life."

She sighs deeply. "Besides, if you had died in there, you and every other castoff would never have existed. Maybe there are some realities you *can't* change."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen. "Could it be? Yes. The Resonance could be used for that."

She shuts her eyes with a wince and says, "But it would require all of your consciousnesses, not just my father's. No. I cannot ask you to do that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My life is not worth the lives of you and your siblings. Anyway, who knows? There may yet be another way to bring me back."

She takes a deep breath. "But it's your choice in the end. You must do what you think is right."</DefaultText>
