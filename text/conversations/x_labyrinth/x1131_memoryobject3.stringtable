      <DefaultText>Your fingers are twitching. Your mind races. Each blink sends branching streams of white fire across the inside of your eyelids. 

You can't deny it: you feel stronger and sharper - more *whole* - than when you landed here. 

Captive light swirls mockingly beneath the thick surface of the orb before you, obscuring shadows - memories - behind it. You will need to claim them somehow if you are to be free of this place, and find your companion.

      <DefaultText>A vision of a city springs up around you - your city, in flames, and under attack. 

Her defenders have fought and died all day, and still the attackers keep coming. They fight as if your destruction were demanded of them. They care nothing for mercy, surrender, or plunder. What they want is *blood*. 

But you have brought a keen-eyed companion to the top of the tower. She has seen the way to stop the invaders. You need to get her to safety, and you need to rally your defenders.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But even as you turn toward the door of the tower, two of the attackers descend from a hovering machine. You don't have time to strike at them before they land. 

One is brutishly large, his weapon a vibrating axe. The other is slim, sheathed in glassy armor, and holding a hilt with a sizzling, invisible blade. 

Your companion backs away - she's too young to help. Your enemies advance single file, confined by the parapet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The giant's first two attacks are blurs. You block the first strike, but the second forces you to your knees. Though you're dazed and your vision is hazy, your armor holds and you keep your wits about you - enough that when he raises the great axe above his head to finish you, you're able to bury your blade under his breastplate. The blade emerges from the back of his neck, and his life's blood washes over your hands. He falls, taking your weapon with him, and his companion attacks!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her invisible blade is far more lethal than the giant's axe. You duck as she thrusts at you, and the wall behind you hisses, destroyed. Her return swing cuts through your armor, ruining your breastplate. She doesn't have to be skilled with a weapon like this - she just has to make contact.

You time your attack just as she pulls it back for another strike. You barrel into her, driving her over the wall, and she drops screaming to the ground fifty meters below.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The immediate threat ended, you focus on finding a way back to your allies. You open the tower door and rush down the stairs. The door at the base of the stairs is slightly cracked, opening just a bit into the hall, and you hear more of the enemy soldiers beyond.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You roll under the blurring arc of his axe. He's overconfident, testing you without committing to the attack.

Yes, he's fast, but not as fast as you are... and when he raises the great axe above his head to finish you, you're able to bury your blade under his breastplate. The blade emerges from the back of his neck, and his life's blood washes over your hands. He falls, taking your weapon with him, and his companion attacks!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memory seems crystal clear: The giant is menacing, it's true, but the invisible blade of his companion is more worrisome still. The energy field that flickers and wavers around it suggests that she can carve matter at the molecular level, tearing pieces of her target into nothingness. If you're to save yourself, your best bet is to tackle her first. She's stuck behind the giant, waiting her turn to attack you, unable to bring her weapon to bear until he's out of the way.</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>But it's clear that she expects him to handle you, and her eyes rove behind you, her focus on your ward. She's certainly not expecting you to dive between the giant's legs and come up inside her guard. She can't bring her blade to bear in time, and you drive your dagger up under her chin.

You catch her before her deadly blade drops onto you and spin her around. The weapon slashes into the giant, and he topples, bisected.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You charge through the dim shadows, dropping your shoulder into the door at the last minute. It bursts open. 

Halfway through its arc, it crashes into the pair of enemy soldiers, scattering them. You race through the door, blade in hand, and you dispatch your stunned foes before they have a chance to move. 

Their blood begins to pool in the hallway.</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>You press yourself against the gleaming door, easing it open, and your breath catches in your throat as it squeaks quietly, the sound like a bell in your memory. You pause, but the soldiers in the hall continue to talk. You push again, squeeze yourself through the narrow opening, and creep down the bloodstained hall.

      <DefaultText>You charge through the dim shadows and burst through the doorway, ramming into the nearest soldier. He falls, and you rebound nimbly off him only to take a direct hit from his companion's blade. The impact launches you down the hall, just as you'd hoped, though the blows makes your ears ring.
  
You come to your feet and race on, ignoring the mild ache in your chest. Projectiles skip and spark off the walls around you, and you barely feel the single, desperate bolt that deflects off your reinforced backplate...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memory begins to fade, and you find yourself back in your own body. 

Your temples throb with the racing force of your heartbeat, and the reclaimed memories blaze within you, like a bonfire on a mountain peak, visible to every predator for kilometers around.

A tremor rocks the floor beneath you, as though a massive fist has struck the room itself. Swaying on your feet, you see frantic movement within the borders of a mirror at the edge of the room.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Speaking quietly, you call a slender shadow to the surface of the glass, into the light. It is a young woman, bound in chains of sorrow.

She speaks quietly of a memory. You lean in, closer and closer, until her whispered words fill your mind...

      <DefaultText>You batter the orb with your fists until cracks spread across the glass, growing and joining.

Light leaks through the cracks like blood, filling your eyes with the orb's radiance, and your mind with another memory...

      <DefaultText>You shout at the orb until a hulking shadow strides to the surface of the glass, into the light. It is a hideous creature, a giant, and it is grinning. Its bloodstained claws leap through the surface of the glass and close over your head.

Even in the attempt, you feel your confidence growing, and a memory rises in the crushing darkness...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your confidence grows. Speaking quietly, you call a slender shadow to the surface of the glass, into the light. It is a young woman, bound in chains of sorrow, and you almost remember her name before she meets your eyes.

      <DefaultText>You shout at the orb, calling to the shadows within. Soon, they are *all* flowing towards the surface of the orb. You reel back, but is too late. They smash through the glass, and envelop you. 

Eyes - the eyes of those you lost - hold you, frozen and helpless. Hulking shadows claw at your throat. Slender blades cut at your heels, and you sink, deeper and deeper, into darkness.

Even as you sink, you feel your confidence grow, and a memory rises that was, perhaps, best forgotten...</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>You dash your knuckles against the orb, bruising the glowing surface but not breaking it. Even so, you feel yourself becoming stronger.

Shadows flow from the center of the orb, making the contusions shift and flow, forming images that fill your mind with another memory...

      <DefaultText>With increased power, you smash the glass with a single blow, and the light coils up around your arm and plunges into your heart, filling it with another memory...

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your frenzied punches draw your own blood but leave no mark on the shining glass. Even so, you feel yourself becoming stronger.

Panting, you pause for breath, and watch as curious shadows, perhaps drawn by the ruckus you've made, drift up from the center of the orb.

Twisting and snarling, they paint themselves across the surface in patterns that suffuse your mind with another memory...
