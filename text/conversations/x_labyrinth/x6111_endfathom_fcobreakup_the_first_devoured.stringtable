      <DefaultText>She focuses on you briefly, struggling to keep you in focus. "The Bloom. I saw the Bloom. I was in its heart, down in its thudding center, and then. Then I was. Nothing. Then I was here. What happened? Wait. Did the Bloom devour me? Is this what I did to the old Memovira? Oh no. Oh no." 

She pauses. "Who are you? How did you get here? Wait. Who am *I*?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was in my fortress. I fought the Sorrow. The Bloom came. And then I was... here. In my memories."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... yes. That is who I am. By the Black Three, those memories are hazy. Slipping away. Listen!"

She reaches out to touch you, but her hands slide through you, only a slight chill marking her passage. "I wasn't the first First. I wasn't. I took that name from a woman I killed, and all this time, my creator never knew. He didn't even recognize that I wasn't the first body. That's how little he cared for us."

She laughs bitterly. "I hate him... and my hatred is disappearing, bite by bite."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is a... a laboratory. The Changing God, he created me, this was one of his laboratories. He used it to experiment with the Tides. That machine there, that was... it was... I can't remember. But this was a laboratory." Her eyes are wild and desperate as she fumbles with the memories.</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was... it looks like a laboratory. But I don't know anymore. I can't be sure. It was... who are you?" She looks away from you, and immediately loses awareness of your presence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That? That's Andronus. I stole him from the Changing God's side. I showed him the truth about my creator's plans. It was an insult to the Changing God, to... wait. No. That's the Changing God. That's the body he used to tell me that all his castoffs are expendable.That's why I befriended Andronus - because I wanted my father to see that every one of his children was against him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks around, her eyes lingering on the lacuna of the Changing God. "Is that him? I was... I was angry with him. I knew why once. I'll remember again. I'm going to talk to him... in just a second."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is where he refused to give me a body, where he refused to recognize me as anything other than a lost piece of himself, where we fought. This is where he told me that we'd all be joined together in his mind. That none of us existed outside him. This is where the Endless Battle started. Here, with his arrogance, his dismissal, this is where I took a stand and said that we would *be* without him, and that I would oppose him with every fiber -!" 

She blinks and looks around. "Who are you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was angry. I remember the word 'fury' but I don't remember how it felt. There was a person there. He was... no. It's gone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The First stalks back and forth, raging at some invisible enemy. She raises her hands to shake them at the ceiling, her mouth working soundlessly, and then looks around, the memories draining from her eyes behind her mask. She stands limp and unmoving for a moment before exploding again into another silent rage.

She fades in and out of corporeality, as if some essential facet had been stripped away.</DefaultText>

She is another victim of the Bloom - another Memovira, devoured by its insatiable hunger.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The door is..." She trails off, her hand pointing at a stone wall. "No, it was... somewhere else."

She shakes her head. "I don't know."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My... Yes. This place is *mine* now." She stands up straighter and points a finger at the face of Andronus. "You will taunt me no longer!"

As she speaks, a portal opens up behind him. She stands unmoving, her finger still pointing at Andronus, at the Changing God.</DefaultText>
