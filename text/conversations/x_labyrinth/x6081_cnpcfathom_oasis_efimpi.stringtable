      <DefaultText>This short, spare, lean-faced ghibra is so wrapped up in his work that he doesn't notice your approach. His multi-colored scales look like they were patched together from an avalanche of shreds and scraps. He squeezes a strangely ticking device in his left hand, regularly checking the readings from this instrument. His expression changes with every glance, twisting from amusement to horror to disgust.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Rhizomes are the answer, not trees," he mutters. "We should never have believed in trees, roots, and radicals. They've made us suffer too much."

He looks up at you in sudden surprise. "You're not a lacuna? Then we are linked, you and I - by life and memory and torment. Tell me, brother, what was the nature of your illusion?" He watches the device in his hand as he awaits your answer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ghibra looks up from his device, fear obvious on his face. "The illusion! No! I broke free from-"

He recognizes you, regaining his composure. "Ah, welcome back, brother."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks up from his device and blinks. "Who are any of us? I am a part of all that we have met. I am that part of you that can hear what you're saying."

Looking down, he gives the device two sharp taps. "Efimpi," he adds.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Figments. Constructions fabricated from our collective consciousness. Take Loyhan there, for instance." He points at a thin, blue ghibra nearby. "He is neither a castoff nor a reflection. There may once have been an actual ghibra merchant named Loyhan - I don't know! Or perhaps he's an archetypal conglomerate. Regardless, he is a dream, created entirely by the Labyrinth. He doesn't even realize where or what he is."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Haven't you been listening? I am no reflection, no lacuna, no construct of your imagination. I am just like you - a castoff, merged by the Labyrinth, awaiting a destination."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We suffer more in our imagination than in reality. All of our brothers and sisters have been drawn into this place. To keep us here while we await our destiny, the Labyrinth constructs illusions from our fears, nightmares from our own self-inflicted torment. It takes the serenity of knowing oneself to free oneself."

A shadow passes over his face. "I was confronted by a scarred man from my past. Were I not *certain* that I had already, truly forgiven him, I would not be speaking to you now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All that consists is real, and the *plane* of consistency is the abolition of all metaphor. Some can free themselves, as I have. Some merely need be *told* that what they fear is unreal. The rest..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perhaps it, also, is an illusion." He frowns. "I seek to understand the nature of our shadows. Speaking with the others has been fruitless. So I observe. I measure. I hope. It is the latter that will be my downfall, I am certain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He squeezes the ticking device again. It ticks faster, and he scowls. "The rest are more difficult. I *suspect* that if one steps into the metaphor with them, takes their hand and leads them out, they can be freed. But you must understand the nature of their regret. I have been unsuccessful in that so far."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He fidgets with the device in his hand for several moments before answering. "Perhaps. You remind me of him, yes."

He looks up at the sky - or what passes for sky in this watery fathom. "This place... it is not good to stay here. Not good at all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>That explains why you couldn't break Matkina from her illusion. You have to understand the nature of her regret before you can help her. Maybe studying her illusion again will help.</DefaultText>
