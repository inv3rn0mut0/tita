      <DefaultText>Wrapped around an aging, stone pillar is a plated creature unlike anything you've ever seen. It hisses at the air, but its eyes - rows of them, like a spider's - are fixed on you, glittering. It's just a statue, but your body trembles to look at it.

It wants something - more than just flesh. There's a strong feeling of malevolent intelligence surrounding this statue that you can't explain.

Even more worrying, however, is the sense of *familiarity* you get while looking at it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The creature doesn't fit any kind of classification in the Ninth World, and it appears too intelligent to be one of the created numenera. This thing is a visitant from some more distant world, or possibly another reality altogether.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The feeling of malevolence, of predation, reminds you strongly of when you first met Dracogen in the Bloom. You don't understand why this creature would remind of that man, however.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Several memories strike you all at once - not memories of your own past life, but those of your siblings.

You see yourself prostrate before a creature exactly like the statue, but larger and more menacing. You're in tears, terrified. The creature stretches out a claw, and some invisible force crushes your chest.

A flash. Light from the creature's many eyes sears through your retina into your brain. You fall on the floor, aware but unable to move.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There are some memories there, but they elude you. They don't feel like *your* memories. Perhaps that is why they are so hard to take hold of.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The flashes of memory do not repeat, but you know now - this is a statue of the *true* Dracogen. It is a creature not of the Ninth World, which uses mortals for its own inscrutable ends.

Several castoffs have crossed paths with it. One even served as a Dracogen in some distant past. When their minds were drawn into the Labyrinth, this statue was constructed from their collective memories.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In another memory, you storm through a burning village in search of some artifact. The memory races forward, and you present that artifact to the creature.

Another flash. You are kneeling before the creature. It speaks in your mind. "Rise, my servant. Today you are no longer cast off. You are *Dracogen*, and you will henceforth speak in my name and carry out my will in this world."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memories flee. You're left trembling. This *thing* is Dracogen - the real Dracogen, not the man. It uses mortals for its own inscrutable ends, even as mouthpieces, as it did with the Dracogen you met in the Bloom.

Several castoffs have crossed it over the centuries. The creature finds the immortality and greed of your siblings useful, and their disregard for mortal lives convenient. This statue was constructed from their memories. One of them even served as a Dracogen long ago.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The eyes remain fixed at the space you were standing before. Perhaps you just happened to notice them when you were standing in the right-

With slow and deliberate care, the eyes swivel in their stone sockets and fix on you again. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out to touch the scaled surface. The statue doesn't move, and you hear nothing beyond the sound of your breath, and yet...

You feel something watching you from beyond this place. A sudden heat bakes the palm of your hand. 

Something tells you that touching this statue is a bad idea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out for the statue again. A blistering heat builds in the air around your hand, as if waiting to see if you'll be foolish enough to lay your hand on the statue this time. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your fingertip scrapes across one of the gleaming scales. You hear a slow, angry hiss before clawed hands close over your head from behind. And squeeze. 

The darkness closes and coils around you, crushing the air from your lungs. Shouted words from the beast strike your mind like misshapen, burning meteors. You try to scream, but nothing escapes. Nothing.

      <DefaultText>You awaken by inches, every joint aching. Something lies heavy and cold in your hand.

At first, you take the gem lying there for one of the statue's eyes. And then, you notice that the serpent is still as whole and untouched as before.
