      <DefaultText>The flickering shapes and ambient shadows that bedevil Tash are almost invisible, but as you near, they take form. You see Matkina struggling against the forces of the First's militia in Kholn... and Tash is lunging at her, snarling as he tries to undo the changes you wrought in his history. </DefaultText>

He struggles to lash out at Matkina, to betray her, to wipe her mind, but his powers fail him,</DefaultText>

He struggles against the constraints you placed on him when you inhabited his body. He snarls and spits as you violate his life and choice. He is alive with defiance and humiliation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He screams, and he begins to glow from within, an incandescence that threatens to spread throughout his frame and devour him. 

But then the light dims. The phantoms around him fade. He straightens unsteadily and looks at you.

"I have suffered. I suffered your... your mind-rape. I have grown and changed. But you have no control over me. Not anymore. I am... I am *free.*"

      <DefaultText>He wraps his arms around himself, becoming insubstantial. "I am *free*," he whispers again, and then he vanishes altogether.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He struggles against your words without hearing them, but they fall like a lash into his mind, and his repeated protestations are no shield against your hate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head violently. He can hear your words, but perhaps not your voice. He claps his hands over his ears. 

"I reject this illusion. I reject it. This is my past. This is not real." The shadows fade, the voices dull and dim. He looks up at you, wonder dawning in his eyes. 

"Yes," he murmurs. "Yes. I am free." He stands straight, and the fabric of his body begins to fray.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He struggles to hear your words, and for a moment it seems that they have had some effect.

But then his personal shades rear up again. He is helpless, reliving the moment you relieved him of his choices, and your words are swept away in his rage and hate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His body begins to shiver and spark. And then a ball of light appears within his torso. It is not a gentle orb but a flaming star, a sun of hatred and wrath. He lifts his hand and looks up to you. Pain and confusion war within his face, with the smallest part of regret.

The light spills from his eyes like incandescent blood. The light pulses once, and pulls Tash inward. He is gone, consumed in a sudden, silent contraction.

The orb hovers for a moment before sinking into the Labyrinth.</DefaultText>
