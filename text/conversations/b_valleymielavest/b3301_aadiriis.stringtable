"You're awake. Quickly now - while you were inside the Mere... gods! The shields have fallen. The Sorrow is breaking into the sanctuary."

She scans the area. "It's destroying our home. The others are trying to hold it back, but tell me first - did you find what you were looking for?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Even among all your siblings in Miel Avest, this woman is remarkably beautiful. Clad in a robe of myriad colors, she carries herself with a distinct grace and ease. Her skin is dark brown, her hair a rippling, midnight black. Her violet eyes blaze momentarily as you approach, and she holds up her hand. Her voice is musical and sweet.

"You are most welcome here, brother. I am Aadiriis. I am the peacekeeper of Miel Avest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ability to ask Aadiriis's opinion could be locked somehow so it's trickier to find that Response Option. If the player asks Aadiriis's opinion, she will say that while she disapproves of the methods, the goals of both sides have always been to protect the castoffs.</DefaultText>

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>When he has learned at least 3 opinions, Aadiriis asks him "In your opinion, what is the point of the Endless Battle?" The player can gather more opinions first, or he can choose to answer at any time. (If the player has gathered all possible opinions, then he must answer now. This conditional might be tricky, so it's optional.)</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>Some response options will only be unlocked when the player has spoken to certain people. No matter what the player answers, Aadiriis will rebut based on her own beliefs - she will even rebut the opinion she herself gave to the player. The point of the task is not to find the correct answer, but to teach the player to constantly learn and challenge his beliefs.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>She will not respond to his answers right away, merely asking him about each task in turn. When he has answered all three, she will explain her philosophy more fully: that her purpose behind the tasks was to challenge the player. Everyone is so certain of their beliefs, but so few challenge them or seek to understand the beliefs of others.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When this trial is over, Aadiriis will entrust the LCO with access to Zerian's Mere, in which he can find Mazzof. She will entreat him again to seek to understand his brethren, not to enforce his will - a will based on his own opinions and beliefs - onto them. If the player gave the "right" answers when asked about the purpose of each task, she will offer the Mere gladly and ask him only to remember what he has learned. If he gave "wrong" answers - showing that he did not understand people - Aadiriis will give him the Mere reluctantly, conceding that whatever the player might do to Zerian in the short term is not as bad as what will happen to all castoffs in the long term if the LCO is unsuccessful.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She might also say something like, "If what you said about Matkina is correct, then the changes you make in history will ripple through reality.

      <DefaultText>"Word of your birth and exploits has reached us here already." She smiles. "News travels fast in the castoff world, as I'm sure you've already seen. I know your desire to speak to Mazzof. I've even heard a rumor that you can alter the past, that you... restored Matkina? This is strange to me, for I have two memories on the subject - one in which Matkina is whole, as we all know her now, and another in which her mind is... incomplete." She laughs. "Perhaps *my* mind is the one that's incomplete."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"*I* remember it, Aadiriis. The attack on Kholn Village, where Paj destroyed my friends - you remember that? In another timeline, Tash used his mindwipe on me.

She shakes her head and smiles slightly. "I must apologize. I do not mean to be rude, but if there is any chance it is true... I have some limited psychic ability. If you will permit me, I would examine your mind to get at the truth of these rumors about your powers."</DefaultText>

She faces you fully. "I have some limited psychic ability myself. If our new friend will allow me, I would examine your mind for the truth."</DefaultText>

She shakes her head. "The conflict they seek to start, the wars... I swore that I would make no deaths in my lifetime, bring no pain.

But he's also volatile and argumentative, and he's devoted his centuries to fighting. You'll likely find him sparring verbally with Raima, whose devotion to the ideals of our sire is the equal of his."

      <DefaultText>She gazes in the direction you're pointing. "Ah," she says, finally. "The feretory."

It's unclear whether she is saying the name with reverence or disgust. "That has been here for as long as anyone can remember - though not, perhaps, when Miel Avest was originally founded. What is known is that the First placed it there. What is not known is *why*. Rumors abound, of course, but as no one knows how to activate or open it, none can be proven."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, the predictable legends. An escape pod of some kind. A final defense against the Sorrow, should it break through. A repository of the First's treasures. I heard one person suggest the First herself was still alive, preserved inside, and that she would return when we needed her most." Her smirk shows what she thinks of this last rumor.

"It's clear that it's a protection of some kind, but whether it's to protect us or what's inside it remains to be seen."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The First placed it here long ago, before she died. Nobody knows or remembers why, though everyone has their own ideas. It seems to be protecting *something*, but whether it's meant as a protection for us or something inside it remains to be seen."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Although the dome no longer encircles our sanctuary, the generators may hold enough power to slow the Sorrow's progress. They can be activated by placing your palm *here* and whistling this tune." Her dry lips rasp a five-note descant that you commit to memory.

She plants a kiss on your cheek. "Good luck, brother. Let's make sure as many survive as possible."

She runs off, her voice raised in command, as if the quiet matron of Miel Avest had never existed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gives you a smile that on anyone else would be patronizing, but on her looks genuinely sympathetic. "I hope you will understand that our kind especially enjoys embellishing the truth. I won't be satisfied until I see for myself."

She puts a hand on her hip. "I would never do such a thing without your permission, of course, but examining your mind is the only way I can be certain." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What's the point?" She sneers. "The Endless Battle *used* to mean something. It used to be people with principles. But they lost sight of their true goals, and it became a self-perpetuating war machine. I don't think the First could stop it now even if she were alive. It's worthless and stupid."</DefaultText>
