      <DefaultText>This five-meter-long, black slab of basalt - or perhaps obsidian - has been smoothed by age. A stone statue holds the slab at angle, lifting it to the sky... or he is lowering it. It is impossible to determine whether the incline is real, or if you imagine it. 

At the top end, you can see a window into another reality, a portal wide enough to step through. On the other side is what looks like a harsh and angular world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The slab is nearly frictionless, and you find it almost impossible to gain any sort of traction. But as you press your fingers into its surface, you can feel it melting slightly at your touch. You pull yourself slowly upward up on your belly, inch by inch, your fingers beginning to bleed.

You have just reached the three-meter mark when the glistening rock begins to shake.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is a gray statue of a robed man with an ornate warhammer strapped to his back, holding the obelisk aloft (or setting it down gently) with his muscular arms, a fierce, determined expression on his face - as if he were using every quantum of energy in raising (or lowering) the great slab.

A sign has been added to his back, a childish scrawl that reads, "The Saint of Proverbs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tableau remains as you remember - the straining statue underneath the great obsidian ingot, his muscles bunching and heaving, the portal beckoning at the top of the slope. It looks easy enough to climb the slab... to walk up it and discover what lies through that glowing gate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It seems perfectly smooth. Some loving hand has polished it to a mirror gloss, though distortions beneath its surface change your appearance with every slight movement. As you lean in to examine it, your reflection appears unspeakably beautiful. A few centimeters closer, and it becomes a shrieking horror. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It seems that the statue has slightly shifted position since you came across it. You're not quite sure, but something about its posture seems slightly different. The sculptor's cunning is such that the statue's eyes follow you wherever you go.

And again, you have the strangest feeling that its expression has changed slightly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The slab lies on the ground. You can barely make out a grayish bloodstain and an outstretched hand - all that remain of the poor figure beneath. The portal at the top has closed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>None, that is, but the strip of gray fabric dangling from the fingertips. It is a mask of strange design, with lenses over the eye-holes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you pick up the mask, its ashen gazes fixes on you. The gray fabric feels like flesh, a slab of wet meat draped across your fingers. A whisper caresses your mind: "Prosper."

You feel an unconscious revulsion, and then you turn away from the fallen slab.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You release your grip and slide to the ground, all your progress lost in a moment. A voice cries out in mortal terror, and the menhir crashes to the ground with a thunderous roar. A great plume of dust rises in the air.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This close, you can feel a dense psychic weight around the obelisk, as if a culture's hopes and expectations had been packed into a single solid form. The thought of meeting those expectations and ascending the incline is... daunting.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When the dust settles, the portal has vanished. 

You can barely make out the fingers of a hand protruding from beneath the rock, holding a scrap of gray fabric that looks almost like a mask. The fingers twitch, once... twice... and are still.

A trickle of dark fluid dribbles out in a thin stream.</DefaultText>
