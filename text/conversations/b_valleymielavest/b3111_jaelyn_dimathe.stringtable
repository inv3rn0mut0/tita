      <DefaultText>This alluring woman looks up, white hair brushing her shoulders. She allows a slight smile to pull at the corners of her mouth. 

Her face is... confusing, for though her skin has the tightness of youth, her eyes pierce you with the wisdom of a hundred years. She rests her hands on the daggers at her hips, perhaps waiting to see if you have the courage to make the first move.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Jaelyn of Underhouse DiMathe," she says, then blinks. "Sorry. Habit. DiMathe has gone into the dark like all the others. I'm just Jaelyn these days."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her face becomes animated, fervent. "We're preparing bodies for Lord Inifere," she says, eyes bright. "Through them he will restore the souls of the lost and grant us the power that is rightfully ours. The Endless Gate is his to command, and through him we will thrive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'd prefer not to," she says, palms of her hands flat on the rounded pommels of her twin weapons. "You seem pleasant enough. I suppose we'll see how things go, won't we?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, you'd *think* violence would work, but that's a dead end," She breathes an irritated sigh. "I think she's one of those altruists. You know, the ones who will stand up to days of torture, but spill any secret if it'll help those who hear it."

She spreads her hands with a roll of her eyes. You notice a streak of blood along the edge of her thumb. "Obviously, she knows we don't mean her well. But maybe you can convince her you *do*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can't believe I told you my full name," she says with a rueful chuckle. "My croftfather would have had me *whipped*."

Her hands close over her daggers. "I come from a world beside this one, from a city in the hollow core, ruled by sixteen underhouses built into the walls. Then..." she frowns, counting silently. "A few decades back, I woke to screams - and not one or two, like you'd get from the lower city from time to time, but hundreds."

She grins, but there is uneasiness in it. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She barks a laugh, hitting her forehead with the heel of her hand. 

"Where *is* my head today. I'm a... what's the word you use here? Torturer. I get information through pain. Underhouse DiMathe was famous for it, and I was the only one of my family left. I thought I'd make them proud by following in the trade here." She shakes her head, sighing at her own naivete.  </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I found out that shadows were pouring from the walls of the world. The underhouses, the people inside, were just melting into it, screaming."

Staring past you, she continues. "A few of us made it out through a portal into the Bloom. The shadows wouldn't follow - I think the Bloom scared even *them*."  She grins. 

"At any rate, I made a living for a while plying the family trade, but there was no joy in it. Not until I found the Endless Gate, and they gave me a *reason* to work."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Huh," she says, chewing her lip. "Well, can't say I'm surprised."

She taps a thoughtful finger on her hip. "Maybe you should go looking for another Memorialist like that one Klin'Kar was after... Ronos something. If he's still around, he might know something."</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nearly starved my first year in the Bloom. Barely anyone wanted to hire me, and those that did paid pittances for my family's holy work and treating me like some kind of monster."

She pinches the bridge of her nose. "I drank a lot in those days. Talking about my family, and how they served the people they killed. Freed them from their secrets, right? And one night, I said all this to a member of the Endless Gate."

She chuckles. "Such luck. They said I belonged with them. They were right."</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, it was foretold," she says with a careless shrug. "Underhouse DiShando - that was the prophet caste - was wrong about the date, is all. Shame that all of us suffered because they were sloppy, but they're either dead now or still getting eaten."

She sighs. "In other words, I knew it was coming my whole life. Wasn't expecting to live through it, so getting weepy about the whole thing would be a slap in the face to everyone I left behind."</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What a remarkable perspective," she murmurs. "Would that more people could act this way. After all, the one great truth of life is that we know it will come to an end one day. What use is it to fuss and bother?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>She bows slightly. "As I said. Why insult the dead by declaring that you are afraid to be among their number?"</DefaultText>
