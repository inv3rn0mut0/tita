      <DefaultText>You study it from every side. There's no inscription to explain why it was erected or by whom, nor is there any obvious way to interact with it.

You do notice that the light from inside the cracks seems to follow your hand as you slide it across. So perhaps it *is* reacting to you after all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You run your hand over the pyramid in the pattern you discovered, except this time you keep going. The white light fades as you do, but a feeling of well-being and strength fills you - as if the light were being transferred directly to your heart.

When you are healed fully, the light fades to nothing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You slide your hands across the pyramid, following not the cracks, but the symbols and etchings on its surface. After a great deal of experimentation - and not a small amount of luck - you discover a specific pattern which causes the light to grow in intensity.

As it does so, a soft warmth envelops you, refreshing your body and mind. As you feel better, however, the pyramid seems to grow more dim.</DefaultText>
