      <DefaultText>The tall, scrawny 'knight' beams at you. His armor is more dent than surface now. 

"My friend!" he cries. "I'd nearly given up hope of seeing you again! And here we are, in a haunted and murderous land!"

He couldn't look more excited about this. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hello, my friend," Quijano says. "Tell me what you need, and it is yours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thankfully, no," the knight chuckles. "Several of these foul Children stood in my way, but I have defeated every one. But I hardly need to tell you, I'm sure. You must have seen their corpses on your way here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah. Hm. That was... well done," he says, clapping you on the shoulder. "A knight should always seek a peaceful resolution to problems. To treat bloodshed as the last resort." 

He only sounds half-convinced by his own words, but claps you on the shoulder again, making your teeth ache. "Well done, noble knight. Very well done."

Then, he shuts his eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our adventure together is done," he says gently. "It is time to find another. But eyes are poor organs - they can only see things as they are." He straightens. 

"Instead, I will walk until I am needed, listening for the cries of the lost and the weeping of the hopeless! Only deprived of sight can I feel the tugging of Destiny upon my heart, leading me where I must go!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh dear," he says, misinterpreting your expression. "How thoughtless of me. I should have left a foe or two for you to face along the way."

He sighs. "How dull your journey must have been. I beg your forgiveness."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How strange," he says. His eyes brighten. "Perhaps they are multiplying! We must cut off the head of the beast!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The foul leader of these 'Children' awaits us," he says in an overly loud stage whisper. "I've forgotten what you said the Children did, but I have no doubt they are guilty of horrendous, unforgivable crimes. When you strike him, I will be at your side!"

He clears his throat. "Of course, if you wish to parlay with the villain first - to avoid unnecessary bloodshed..." He brightens. "I will wait here. Until bloodshed is inevitable!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hmm," he says, his brow wrinkling. "Standing. Muttering. *Plotting*, I'd say. He looks the type."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm sure he is scheming. Or plotting." His eyes widen. "Perhaps both!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That was well done. *Well* done," he says, clapping you on the shoulder so hard your teeth ache. "Our foe is vanquished! On to the next adventure!"

Then, he shuts his eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I say, I..." He looks at the wall strangely, then at you. "You'll have to forgive me, but I'm feeling confused, uncertain of what is real and not. Tell me, did we... did we come here to vanquish a foe or not?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Really?" He blinks twice. "Well, that was... well done. I suppose."

He claps you so hard on the shoulder, your teeth ache. "Well done, noble knight. Well done."

Then, he shuts his eyes.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, of *course* I was!" He claps you on the shoulder. "You weren't so bad yourself, you know. You are a fine knight, a *fine* knight. Well done."

Then, he shuts his eyes.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>He seems taken aback. "Really? But I thought..."

He shakes his head and smiles. "No matter. If there is no evil to be vanquished here, then I must find it elsewhere."

Then, he shuts his eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks fondly at the scrawny man. "Heroes always try to avoid bloodshed until necessary. Sir." He bows. "I find you deeply admirable!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"By the Black Three. Are you heroes, or are you touched in the head?" He massages his forehead as if trying to stave off a headache.</DefaultText>
