      <DefaultText>The four statues on the altar slab stand in a square. Each is identical, except for the collar. The back left one has a collar made of red triangles, the front left one has a collar made of blue squares, the front right one has a collar made of green circles, and the back right one has a collar made of yellow hexagons. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You watch from the undergrowth, terrified, as the followers of the bird god pull down the stone statues of the great ones and chase the monks from the burning temple.

"Heathen!" cries their leader. "Worshippers of false gods! Kill them all!" 

A bird man sees you. He shrieks. "A ceturl! We must kill it. The monks hide their souls in the little beasts. If we don't wipe them all out, the monks will return, as strong as ever!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You watch from a low branch as grave robbers tear up the stones of the ruined temple's nave, looking for the old catacombs. Their leader sits on the stone head of a fallen statue, patting it and stroking its pointed ears. He laughs. 

"This is what the old monks worshipped before the Jarudi wiped them out. The prince of the ceturl. They say his big ears hear all the secrets ever whispered within earshot of any of those six-eyed pests."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You watch from under a gandu bush as a father and mother drop double armloads of springwood in the middle of the temple ruins, then sit and mop their brows as their three children begin stripping the stalks of their bark. 

"Plenty to build with out here at least," says the father. 

"And we'll need all we can get," says the mother. "Without a perimeter fence to keep out the bauls and the skull hounds we'd be dead in a week."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You drop the laak at his feet and arch your back as he strokes your fur and adjusts your collar. 

"But your work isn't done, sweet girl. There's laaks aplenty in the grain room. Bring me a dozen more before I finish these haos and I'll give you your favorite nibble."

A dozen laaks is nothing to a hunter of your skill. You pad off to the granary, ready for battle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hiss at the insult. He looks up. "Hoy, there's one now. Hasn't been a monk alive around here to tame a ceturl in a hundred years."

He chirps at you. "Come here, little one. Let me see that jeweled collar of yours, won't you? Looks like lovely workmanship."

You give him a disdainful look and climb further up the tree as the obelisk returns.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What about the laaks?" one of the children cries.

The father laughs. "Pray to Guni, daughter. Maybe he'll send one of his servants for us. He's the prince of all ceturl, you know!"

Your ears prick up. At last, you are wanted. It's time to hunt!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Except for four stylized depictions of the same sharp eared animal that tops the obelisk, the pictographs make no sense to you, but you believe, with a little more study, you might be able to decipher them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The more you look at them, the more you feel that the engravings are struggling to be understood, as if they have a sentience of their own. You also notice that each of the animal pictographs is inlaid with a different color - yellow, red, blue, and green.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tail of the dead laak in your mouth drags along the ground as you creep through the dense foliage to the temple. You peek out through the gandu fronds and see the old monk, Nimu, shucking hao pods on the weathered steps. You pad out to greet him, and he grins toothlessly at the sight of you.  

"There she is," he says, chuckling. "There's my brave hunter, and with a gift. How thoughtful."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The base of the obelisk is smooth, untouched by any weathering or other troubles that seem to have eroded much of the other ruins in this place.

It sits in a pool of acrid liquid. The liquid smells foul and caustic, but the obelisk appears undamaged. It's unclear how much more of the obelisk lies beneath the pool.</DefaultText>
