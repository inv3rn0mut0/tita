      <DefaultText>"An obscene quantity of blood adorns the floor and walls of this tomb. Messages in a bastardized form of the Truth are traced on the bloody walls. The cultists who have overrun the Valley seem to have a special affinity for the occupant of this pod.

But try as you might, you can't find anything useful here, and you back away with no fresh insight."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Within is a thing of strange dimensions and impossible angles, spun from an unearthly metal that seems to flow as you examine it. Its branching limbs cross in a lattice that holds no clear pattern.

Tidal energies seep from it, and you recognize the sigil of the Changing God stamped on its base. What else it might be, this is a Merecaster.

But not one you can use, at least not now. Someone has twisted it out of alignment, and it would be impossible guesswork to return it to a proper state.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Children of the Endless Gate seem to have paid special attention to this tomb. Their scrawl covers it in bloody smears and gobbets. What little you can read seems to offer praise to the dead woman and to whatever it is the Children worship.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When you stumbled across this tomb before, you didn't know that you'd return on Ronos Cai'sul's instructions... but perhaps you should have known. 

Girded with the knowledge of Marcysa's name, you search more thoroughly this time. Perhaps you will uncover something valuable amidst the offal.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Incomprehensible scratches and scrawls, all of them, and you can't make sense of them. Yet... somehow they fill you a vague and nameless horror.

Amidst the bloody rants and paeans, you find a symbol carved into the stone itself. You recognize it as the sigil of the Children of the Endless Gate, surrounded by scrawls to an unnameable and alien god.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tomb has changed. Now it is no longer a memorial to Marcysa, Inifere's faithful assistant - it is a shrine to the one who first opened the Endless Gate. Your castoff brother's memory is kept alive here, and the scrawls on the wall venerate his name.</DefaultText>

Still, you're fairly certain this is the tomb of Marcysa, whose proximity to Inifere must be what inspired this display of... you hardly dare call it "devotion." But it's certainly effusive. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you reach out to touch the symbol a spark flares from from it, and you feel your tattoo blazing in sympathy. The rock under the symbol evaporates, as if it were transmuting itself into another dimension, revealing a large niche.</DefaultText>

Amidst the bloody rants and paeans, you find a symbol carved into the stone itself. You don't recognize the sigil, but if it was cut into the rock, it must have been intended to last for many generations.</DefaultText>

It is signed, "Inifere."</DefaultText>
