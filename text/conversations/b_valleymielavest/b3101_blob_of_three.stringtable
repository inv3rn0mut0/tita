      <DefaultText>This corpulent mass is almost too large, but slowly you realize it is three beings somehow melded together into one, a fleshy jumble of three faces on a single head protruding from a shapeless mass of a torso. Two of the faces track your approach while the third mutters under its breath.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When it speaks, the three voices blend into one buzzing, angry harmony. "Tell us who you are. Tell us what you want. Do you also seek the mask? Did you climb the leaning obelisk here in the Valley, held aloft by Saint Proverbius?"

The third face begins cursing and drooling. "Slimy Jolian... Wizened. Hate them. C-c-cold and red. P-p-..." It trails off, as if dazed. When it resumes, it's looking in another direction entirely. "... Ill. So ill."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The strange creature reacts savagely, thrashing and flailing. "No! No! We are... h-h-h-happy... this way. *Happy*." The conjoined faces look anything but happy, and its straining limbs are practically tearing it apart, but the blob's tone suggests that you're an idiot for wanting to help.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The third face sprays a fine mist of saliva and phlegm across the other two. "You are fools! You have lost the way!"

The three faces begin to bicker and squabble in an incomprehensible tongue, and one of them bites into the blob's exposed flesh. The other two howl in rage, and begin gnashing and howling, occasionally snapping bloody chunks out of their own flesh, creating wounds that heal as soon as they appear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We climbed the leaning obelisk to seek the Mask of Prosper. Everyone should climb the obelisk. We entered the p-p-portal. We emerged on the other side as you see us. A maze surrounded us, over which the painful shadow of a deity was c-c-cast. It was a labyrinth of straight corridors and right angles, full of traps, puzzles, and monsters. At last we emerged, and now dream of the w-w-way to return, to optimize our e-e-experience."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two of the three faces seem positively delighted.  The third raves and growls, and they chitter back and forth in their strange tongue. Their tone grows strident and vicious, and they snap at each other with their pointed teeth.

And then as one they snarl at you. "Never. Never would we be associated with you. Filth. Corruption."

The first says, "What of others? Name one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The second face says, "Need one who is similar to us. Who knows songs of *power*."

The first face replies, "There are none like us! None! We are pure! Pure!"

The third face gibbers profanity. You don't understand its words, but its meaning is clear - it hates everyone and everything but itself.</DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>The three faces faces all strain to seize control of the body, and they stare at you as best as they are able. "W-w-what? What is wrong with us? We are perfect. Pure. Old guard of old ways. Protectors of t-t-truth."

The blob pauses for a moment. "But r-r-respect you for speaking mind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The creature pauses its constant movements. "W-w-what? You climbed but didn't s-s-see? What kind of falsity do you p-p-peddle?" 

It waves a deformed hand at you. "Bah. Expected b-b-better. But you do not think. You only *do*. Never will improvement come. Never."</DefaultText>

      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>It bobs its head, the three faces in sad agreement. "Yet we travel it regardless. We seek its g-g-glories, but expect declines in our f-f-fortunes. No justice exists. Only small spots of h-h-hope."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The blob's mouths gasp simultaneously. "The mask. The Mask of Prosper. The Face that Never Remembered." They yearn for it, even as they squirm away.

      <DefaultText>"Then we don't want it anyway. Anything you t-t-touch is tainted! Garbage!" Its fingernails drag long furrows through its flesh, bloody runnels that heal instantly.
