      <DefaultText>"Give me a moment, will you?"

He doesn't wait for answer, but walks toward the monument. He stands, hands folded in front of him. The tattoos that normally writhe across his arms are still as well.

He lifts his head after a moment and sees you watching him.

"Well?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A tall wire-and-metal frame stands on top of a synth base. The base contains dozens of carvings in a foreign script.

The frame has been cunningly devised from strange materials, and within it colored lights curl and intersect like smoke, dancing in a wavering helix. The lights occasionally combine to create human figures, which dissolve in a second or two without ever resolving into distinct features.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fine."

He turns to rejoin you, and then takes one last look over his shoulder.

"This is what life comes to. A couple scratches on a marker, slowly fading over the years. Assuming you've got someone who'll mark your passing. But even then, the memories fade."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He runs his fingers along some markings. "It's everyone I've ever cared about. Distant family. Cousins, uncles and aunts. People I'd known my whole life, grew up with them. Took them for granted."

He closes his eyes. "And close family."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was an Aeon Priest in an aldeia called Ormen, off to the west of Sagus Cliffs. A little place, not really on any maps, but I found plenty of ways to keep myself occupied. Kept up the town's defenses from the roving animals, looked at the numenera they dug up or found, and spent my days with my family."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "You tell yourself you're going to change the world, and you wind up in the dirt, dead and gone, and the world keeps rolling on."

      <DefaultText>"Problem is, that traveler is hard to find - slippery. People know about him, but they don't know where to find him. Maybe we'll have more luck in Miel Avest. Maybe then I'll get some answers."

A half-smile plays on his lips. "They must know a lot about the Changing God. I appreciate your help getting there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As Aligern turns away, Matkina catches your sleeve and mutters, "So tell me... do you think anyone will mourn our deaths? All around us... ordinary humans commemorating their dead, marking down the legacy of the fallen, expressions of love and respect. But who will do that for us?"

Then she laughs, as if dismissing her sadness. "No one. I mean, it's not like we've got anyone to commemorate either."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Upon closer inspection, you believe this monument - or at least parts of it - to be a recent addition to the valley. Nearly everything around here is weathered, buried, or in decay. And while the synth base meets those criteria, the carvings within it look relatively fresh - there are even a few synth shavings still resting at the base of the monument.

Likewise, the wire-and-metal frame has been built from several different pieces and materials, all grafted onto the synth base.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>So the script is a Ninth World language then, but not the Truth. Perhaps it was carved by members of a small village or aldeia in the area - far from the larger cities.

The wire-and-metal frame was built by someone skilled with the numenera. He or she used disparate devices to create a beautiful vortex of light.

This is a memorial for someone - or perhaps several someones - built with great care. The artisan's loss weighs heavily as you look upon this piece.

Perhaps that is its purpose.</DefaultText>
