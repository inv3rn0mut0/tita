      <DefaultText>This monument tapers to a narrow point. From a distance the obelisk appears several meters tall, but when you stand at the foot of it, some kind of optical illusion makes it look as though the obelisk *keeps going*, rising, narrower and narrower, into the wide sky.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Approaching the obelisk, you still can't shake the feeling that it's much taller than it appears.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a billowing pillar of burning, oily smoke in a ravaged throne room. You, your companions, and a handful of unfamiliar castoffs lie motionless around it. Not all of the bodies are whole. 

Then, the pillar - the Sorrow - turns, unfurling long claws. 

Reaching for *you*.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You return to the vision of the ruined throne room. You and your companions lie scattered across the floor like charred leaves. 

The Sorrow is nowhere to be seen, but you can feel it. Behind you, perhaps.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Above the roar of hungry flame, you hear someone gasping raggedly for breath. 

You open your eyes on a vision of burning devastation. The Sorrow towers above it, studying the woman impaled upon its claws with clinical interest.</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>You revisit the vision of the Sorrow, surrounded by a wheel of flame, with a woman impaled upon its claws. 

But the Sorrow is no longer studying the dying woman. It is looking directly at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The moment your fingertip grazes the daggerlike stone, your mind is seized by cold fingers and hurled high into the air. Shreds of cloud whip past. Stars streak by you and are lost in the void.

Ahead, a light blooms, threaded with silvery ribbons of time. You plunge into the light, and a vision of the future unfurls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The prophetic light fades, leaving you standing before the obelisk once more. 

You study the monument, frowning. Though the vision *felt* true, it hardly seemed to have been worth all that effort. Perhaps touching it again will yield different results. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The obelisk trembles beneath your hand, as though something has stirred - or awoken - within. 

Then, your mind lances into the sky, toward that prophetic star. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hands close over your mind and hurl it back to back to Miel Avest, back to the obelisk. You stagger away from the monument, clutching your head.

It seems the obelisk does show meaningful visions after all. </DefaultText>
