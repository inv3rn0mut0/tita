      <DefaultText>As you touch the engravings on the epitaph, you feel familiar stirrings of air pushing your eyes toward the imperfections on the surface. As with Choi's tomb,  the glyphs of the Truth curl into shape as distortions of the air and form themselves into the name of the deceased: "Ronos Cai'sul."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With the loss of his daughter, Cai'sul resigned from the Aeon Priests and turned his full attention to destroying the cult. By then, they had moved on, leaving him with no object for his revenge." 

The voice flatly notes, "Rinda Cai'sul took her own life. Ronos redoubled his efforts, sold all that he possessed, and devoted himself to finding the Children. In time, he hired an explorer named Marcysa to assist in this pursuit."

There is a pause, then: "Neither returned."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gentle breezes control the flickering of your eyes toward unpredictable places on the epitaph, and the patterns and purpose of the gusts becomes clear. 

They've been training your eyes to *see*, and suddenly the truth comes clear in twisting, hovering glyphs. They are made of the wind, distortions in the air. They're in an older version of the Truth, but you can read them: "Ronos Cai'sul."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The air turns and curls, again drawing your eyes to the secret name that hides in the wind. Again the pulsing questions hum behind the air:

      <DefaultText>A host of images appear, a series of pictures collected from the lifetime of a handsome, driven man, in various poses: as a baby learning to walk, as a child exploring the shell of some sort of crashed flying vessel, as a young man studiously dissecting a numenera tool, as a father, as a widower. Through the course of years, his face grows more haggard and rugged, but he retains a youthful charm.

He looks nothing like the Ronos Cai'sul you encountered outside in the Valley. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You remember the words of Choi's marker: "Your name will live forever."

And so you whisper that name, "Choi." 

It works. Reams of potential information begin spilling into the air, hidden behind these words:

      <DefaultText>Lighted images appear on the currents of air, subtly distorted, and they show the progression of Ronos Cai'sul's life. A voice, slightly modulated through the wind, speaks. "Ronos Cai'sul was born Ronos Jenvin - an only child in a successful merchant family of Sagus Cliffs. His parents sought for him a position within the bureaucracy. He showed an early aptitude for the gentlemanly pursuits of governing, weaponcraft, and poisons. His interests took him elsewhere."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A voice speaks: "Experiments included vivisection and necrosection on a variety of creatures across the Protectorate's biome. These led to investigations into cross-dimensional manifestations and psychoses, a field of study Cai'sul abandoned upon the death of his daughter."

      <DefaultText>A subdued male voice speaks. "While Scholarch Cai'sul liquidated the overwhelming majority of his estate shortly before his disappearance, certain family trusts and ongoing honoraria and royalties remained. These were assigned to the Aeon Priests of Sagus Cliffs until confirmation of Cai'sul's death. At that time, his remaining properties escheated to the city."

A list of financial instruments and revenue sources scrolls across the screen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A voice of indeterminate gender reports, "Scholarch Cai'sul nee Jenvin conducted extensive research into his background. He has uncovered trace evidence that he is distantly related to the Slave Families, though further research suggests that his particular branch was excised 150 years prior to his birth. He married Rinda Cai'sul, and they produced one daughter, named Choi. She perished, and with her passing, both the Cai'sul and Jenvin lines vanished."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He became fascinated by the secrets of the ancients, and experimented with their lost knowledge, under the tutelage of the Aeon Priests. As one of their number, he sought the secrets of life, and established himself in the field of medicine, focusing particularly on those damaged by the numenera."

"He married Rinda Cai'sul, taking her name for himself and their family. They had a daughter named Choi. She was the new center of Ronos's life, until the Children of the Endless Gate abducted and murdered her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ronos vowed to avenge Choi's death and destroy the cult. This vendetta consumed him."

      <DefaultText>"Years after disappearing, Cai'sul sent a letter to his oldest mentor."

The voice quakes slightly. "In it, Cai'sul explained that he had found the Children, and their leader Inifere. He wrote, 'Inifere and the others are victims, not monsters. They are prisoners of pain, and Inifere is a slave to dark masters beyond our plane. Rather than seek vengeance, I will endeavor to set them free.'"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Through your eyes, Choi looks at her father's marker. Sadness seeps out of her, into your mind. The realization that this shadow is all that remains of him. 

And then, a revelation shakes her, and she speaks to you softly. &lt;The marker is all that remains out *there.* But he's not gone, not truly. Just... changed.&gt;</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>And with that, Choi's entire essence changes. She's no longer a corpse moldering inside you. She's not a curse hung from your mind, a grit of regret that could, in time, rasp your soul raw. 

No. 

She's the opposite now: a balm, however slight, the sense that what is broken can be repaired, what is severed, made whole.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Perhaps the dead girl has some connection to Ronos. It is as good a guess as any, and so you whisper the name, "Choi." It works.

      <DefaultText>"Some months later, Cai'sul's body was transmitted to that mentor as well. And many years after that, the body of his guide, Marcysa, was deposited in the Valley of Dead Heroes."

"Thus ends the story of Ronos Cai'sul, entombed herein. His wife, Rinda Cai'sul, is interred in her family's ossuary in Sagus Cliffs. The marker of his daughter, Choi Cai'sul, can be found at 4-2-2-1. Marcysa's tomb lies at 1-2-5-4."
