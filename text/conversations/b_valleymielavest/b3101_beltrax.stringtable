      <DefaultText>"Well, my friend," he says, "I have no idea why you're so generous with your time and your life, but your bravery is beyond reproach. I've some small familiarity with the weapons I carry, but I'd rather not try my prowess against three of them at once, and I vowed to Ronos that I'd keep him safe. I do not know how it is that they left without doing you harm - is there any chance you might tell me?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That was some fight!" His bearded face is full of concern. "Are you hurt?" He carries a variety of well-worn weapons on his person, and a bandolier of small images and trinkets across his body. He claps a hand to his chest. "I'm Beltrax."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He helps you to your feet, his bearded face full of concern. "Are you... are you all right? I thought the Children would hack you to pieces, but once they knocked you down they left. I would have rendered aid, but... I vowed to Ronos I'd keep him safe, and I'm the kind of man who takes his word seriously." 

He laughs nervously. "It appears I can't do anything for you anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They came to the Valley recently. Perhaps a month, perhaps only a week or two. Maybe some of them have been here for longer than that. I don't know. The Children's arrival was slow and insidious - they didn't make the ruckus they're making now. Then a few days ago, they just went... berserk. Started abducting and slaughtering, and... well, here we are."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a vast graveyard of sorts. But you're not going to find any bodies here above ground. You'll need to get to the Necropolis to find the real tombs. But to get there, you've got to use the minnims - floating pools of light, and when you walk into one, you walk out its twin someplace else."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The minnims always appear in pairs. My theory is that they're alive - some sort of creatures. Anyway, each pair remains in the same locations for years at a time, I'm told, but sometimes they move or reappear someplace else entirely. Far as I can tell, using them is perfectly safe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This sounds embarrassing when I say it out loud, but I came here to meet up with a sorcerer to quest for a fabled magic board." 

He shrugs. "I haven't met the sorcerer yet, but I did meet a Memorialist. She told me about the work they do here. About this being the afterlife, that the names we bore in life are hidden in the Valley in the names of the 'dead' - who she called the truly living.  I have to admit, that was about the most carked tripe I'd ever heard."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the Children of the Endless Gate vanish into the Valley, two dusty figures clamber out of a hidden niche. The first, a bearded man with a wide smile, carries a variety of well-worn weapons on his person, and a bandolier of small images and trinkets across his body. He claps a hand to his chest. "Hello, friend. Apologies for the unfortunate welcome you just received. I'm Beltrax, and my companion here is Ronos - Ronos Cai'sul."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This slender, nervous man is dressed in formal robes of blue and white. He swallows as his eyes dart around the area. "Are they gone? ... I'm sorry - I forget my manners." He bows to you. "We are truly grateful for your intercession with those monsters. We'd have helped, gladly, but..." He shoots a look to his friend.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He jerks back, shocked, and then leans in to study your tattoo. "I've never met one of you before," he says admiringly, "though I've certainly heard of  you." 

He lifts a brooch from his bandolier and shows it to you. "This woman, she told me about the time she met one of your kind. He helped her escape the Bloom, out in Sagus Cliffs. Good fellow, I'm told. Wonder what ever became of him?"</DefaultText>

These carkers - Children of the Endless Gate - are running through here slaughtering everyone. The Memorialists have gone into hiding. One of them took it upon herself to stop the cultists from entering the Necropolis, but..."</DefaultText>

He plucks one of the lockets from his bandolier, pops it open, and reveals a glowing image of a woman. He regards her wistfully. "What if she's still alive somewhere? What if this isn't life... if I'm just a shadow waiting to step into the light? What if she's there waiting for me?"</DefaultText>
