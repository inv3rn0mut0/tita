      <DefaultText>Stark letters have been carved into the rock above with a steady hand. Sharp memories emerge at the sight of the masked figure in the tableau.

The First Castoff. 

Countless footsteps have worn a track to - and apparently *into* - this mural. This is a gateway of some kind, but you can see no way of opening it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The gateway is either deactivated or broken. The code Matkina gave you won't help you here. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina must not have known that the portal would be closed, else she would have said something. Whoever deactivated it must have done so recently.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What is this..." Matkina puts her hands up against the wall, searching for something. "Someone closed the portal from the other side. I don't... I don't know how to wake it back up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Oddly, many of the words above are completely unreadable. It's not that they're in a language you don't understand. It's Truth, and you recognize every letter. 

Every time you try to put it all together, the meaning slips from your mind. Maybe that part of the epitaph isn't meant for you. Your eye skips to the end of the message.

"She serves us still." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She serves us still," is the only legible part of this epitaph. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You lay your hands on the cold stone as the First Castoff once did, and press your forehead against the mural.

The skin around your tattoo crawls, then burns. But even with your eyes clenched shut, you feel the air of the tomb stirring.</DefaultText>
