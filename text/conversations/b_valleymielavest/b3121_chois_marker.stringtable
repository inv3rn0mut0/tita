      <DefaultText>As you approach the rock pillar of the tomb, you feel subtle variations in air temperature and pressure around you. Tiny gusts and zephyrs push your eyes toward specific striations in the stone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Remembering what you were told, you hold your breath. The gentle breezes control the flickering of your eyes toward unpredictable places on the wall, and the patterns and purpose of the gusts quickly become clear. 

They have been training your eyes to *see*, and suddenly the truth comes clear in twisting letters made from distortions in the air itself. They're in an older version of the Truth, but you can read them.

It's an epitaph, and it bears the name Choi Cai'sul.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cai'sul... that was the surname of the Memorialist you met when you entered the Valley, the man who was teleported away to safety: *Ronos* Cai'sul.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The breeze summons up the name of Choi Cai'sul and tells her story - how she was killed by the Children of the Endless Gate, and her loved ones swore vengeance. When it has finished, the wind drops and the letters vanish.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Words appear in the air, shivered into being by the subtle gusts, and you read the tale.

"Come you now to the tomb of Choi Cai'sul. It stands empty, for her body is gone - wrested away by the foul Children to feed their Endless Gate and its infernal master. We raise this marker to commemorate the life of our beloved... To swear undying vengeance upon the man who stole her from us. Choi Cai'sul - your name will live forever."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The shapes hover in the air a moment longer, and then the air ceases its restless flight. The letters disappear instantly, and all that remains is the sound of your breathing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you touch the engravings on the pillar, you feel stirrings of air pushing your eyes toward the imperfections on the wall, as they did with Ronos's tomb. Unlike that tomb, however, you cannot make sense of anything you see.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Choi stirs in your mind. She sees what you see, you feel what she feels - but you cannot put a name to her emotion. Acceptance of her fate, perhaps, or resignation, or pain at her parents' pain. Beneath that, something else - comprehension of the depth of their love for her, revealed only when she was stripped away. 

She whispers inaudibly.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>And with that, Choi's entire essence changes. She's no longer a corpse moldering inside you, nor a curse hung from your mind, a grit of regret that could rasp your soul raw. 

No. 

She's a balm now, however slight, the sense that what is broken can be repaired, what is severed, made whole.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The gentle breezes push your eyes one way and another, but there seems to be no pattern or reason to it. It's probably crazy to think the wind is doing anything purposeful.</DefaultText>
