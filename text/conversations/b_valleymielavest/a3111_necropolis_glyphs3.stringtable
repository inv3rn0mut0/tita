      <DefaultText>The symbols that cover this section of wall are placed in shallow, independent divots, like the weight of their carving has borne them deeper into the rock. The cumulative effect is that of a large, faceted jewel, awaiting only the correct quality of light to shine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Each symbol is hexagonal in nature, with a varying number of lines inscribed within. Each line is parallel to those around it and none of the lines intersect, yet there is a variance to their construction that hints at a finite number of permutations. They could be numbers, words, or even ideas. Whatever they are, they were worth preserving for countless millennia longer than anyone - or anything - that could read them could possibly have lived.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once again you're struck by the absolute intent of these alien markings, that someone - or something - would wish them to endure far beyond whatever civilization created them. Their ultimate meaning, however, continues to elude you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Placing your hand on one of the symbols causes it to emit a soft, ambient glow. The moment you remove your hand, however, the glow disappears. You repeat the exercise with several of the symbols, all to the same effect, none the wiser as to what's going on behind the rock on the chamber wall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You touch several symbols in turn, but their glow fades the moment your hand is no longer in contact with the stone depressions that surround each of the symbols.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You move your hands quickly across the wall, but the first symbol repeatedly goes dark before the sixth has begun to shine. You try placing various parts of your body against the stone in different places, but are unable to tell whether you have six effective points of contact or not. Eventually, you're forced to admit defeat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's incredibly difficult to hit six symbols while trying to avoid the most common. You take a deep breath and, operating more on instinct than conscious thought, manage to touch the sixth symbol with a fingertip before the first goes dark.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As before, the stone in front of you slowly turns translucent as the alien cacophony deafens you. This time, however, the glowing core within the wall resolves into a woven sphere of light, anchored to the floor by reddish-purple vines. The globe wavers between its anchor points in a lazy approximation of a circle, tracing a six-patterned spiral in the air.

      <DefaultText>You understand suddenly that the sealed off chamber was meant to be the same as the configuration before you. The transparent stone bears similarities to the material sealing the door, its opacity waxing and waning in concert with the light of the sphere.

Unfortunately, the room's purpose, and whether it was created by the same alien intelligence as the symbols, is unclear. When you take a step back, the stone resolidifies and the noise stops, leaving you standing in resonating silence.

      <DefaultText>The vines cluster more closely underneath the sphere, not impeding its movement but growing as close to its influence as they can. You understand they're drawing nourishment from the light, though they lack any of the characteristics of any plants you've ever seen. 

The purpose of the combination of light source and vine remains unclear, and whether this is a natural or unnatural occurrence likewise remains a  mystery.

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, a grating, shrieking cacophony fills the room, echoing in the enclosed space until it's nigh unbearable. A space behind the rock wall begins to brighten, the stone turning slowly translucent to reveal a dazzling, glowing core within.
