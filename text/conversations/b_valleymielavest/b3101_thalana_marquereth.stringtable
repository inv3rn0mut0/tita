      <DefaultText>You see a slender woman covered in worn brown robes leaning over the fire, the cowl pulled low over her head. Her skin is a dark bronze color.

"Here to interrogate me?" She pulls back her cowl enough for you to see that her long hair is more silver than brown, and the years of life on the road are apparent in her face. She looks weary and exhausted except for her eyes, which burn like golden fire. "I'm Thalana MarQuereth. What do you w-"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Me, Denovan, Luca, Timpo, Zad, and all the rest... they're my crew, my men. We're just trying to find a way home from the Endless Battle. We came through Kholn, but... " She waves a hand at the pile of rubble. "It's not exactly a forgiving route. Just trying to figure out where we go next."

Her sleeve slips with her gesture. You can see that her skin does not simply look metallic - it *is* metal. She catches you looking and tugs her sleeve back down, annoyed.</DefaultText>

She frowns. "Instead there's some sort of cult war going on. We've got to leave sooner rather than later." She nods her head as if receiving compliments from an unseen audience.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good enough. They were normal people once. Ordinary, thrill-seeking kids. Look at them now."

"Most wars," she starts, "a group of people march in with their artifacts - gravity, light-pulse, timebenders - and march back out. Endless Battle is like that, but going on for *centuries*. Think of what it does to the landscape. Think of what it does to the psychic terrain. Think of what it does to your *friends*." She waves at her nearby companions, her gesture continuing to colleagues unseen. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks confused for a moment. "You're a castoff. So either you're here to drag us back - or kill us."

She turns to her side and pauses, as if listening to words that you cannot hear. Then she responds. "No, I suppose you're right. Still. He's a castoff."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs. "Well. It was after the Fourth Inversion that the three of us realized we were the draff in the machine - just a bit of tulk to draw attention away from the big maneuvers. We took a look at our accrued pay and realized it wasn't worth the poisoning of our realities, so we left. We didn't see anything, and didn't get anywhere near the intelligence. We're just grunts, all right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"By the Black Three, you castoffs are all the same. Money, power... you just want it all for yourselves."

She pats down her pockets, turns out the variety of odds and ends from her pouches, and then shouts at her companions. She looks disapprovingly at another spot, and says, "None from you, eh? Typical."

"Here. It's what we have."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "It's a village on the outskirts of the Endless Battle. Place is full of legends of the monsters that lived there once. The locals play up the superstitions, try to scare people with stories of the horrors that made it their home. Not a pleasant place to stay. Insular, nasty people."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mostly empty. Place cleared out mysteriously a while back, and then some new people moved in.

Place is a dust-bowl. Not worth a thing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And when you're vermin to the people who *run* the war, when you got no hope to survive, and you can feel realities collapsing around you... when you see wormholes open up and monsters walk through. When the air is toxic and the ground melts and you feel your mind assaulted. But it's not personal. It's not someone who wants *your* destruction in particular. You're just... inconvenient to them. Your death is another number, a way to measure their success. It's... hell. A business-like hell."</DefaultText>

Soon everything is conflict and pain. All that matters is your success. And you've killed yourself, and you don't even know it."
