      <DefaultText>A bewildering array of colliding, jagged edges and mangled corpses make up this frieze. It's not quite clear whether the artist was inspired, drunk, or insane.  

A battlefield is depicted here, that much is certain. But the amount of detail is staggering, and it isn't immediately apparent what the artist was trying to convey. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The first detail you notice is the fortress, standing out from the wall in bold relief. Many of the soldiers shown are pouring through the sundered gates, and every one of their faces shows a different emotion. Elation. Rage. Terror. 

But it is the jagged edges, seemingly raised at random, that pull your attention down to the bottom right of the piece. There lies the First Castoff of the Changing God, mortally wounded. 

Dying alone as divergent realities snap shut around her like teeth.   </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once again, you see soldiers pouring into a breached fortress, triumph etched across their ageless faces. You see the terrible cost of the battle spread out behind them in broken bodies and scattered limbs. 

And in a distant corner of the frieze, you see the First Castoff of the Changing God lying in the mud, dying alone. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her voice is contemplative. "I love this piece. Last time I came back to Miel Avest, I stood here for an hour. I like to think that she's suffering as much as she caused Neng to suffer. More."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She snarls, "Those who believed in her slaughtered the only family I ever knew. They might talk about their need for strategic and tactical victory, but what they really mean is that they shed the blood of innocents. They want to talk about sacrifice? Let them feel its pain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The past touches on today, you idiot. Everything that happens then makes *now* happen. You want me to recall her as some holy person? Forget her flaws when she was responsible for the deaths of untold thousands? No. Let her crimes be remembered until the end of time, as far as I'm concerned."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "It might. But when the only family *you* ever knew gets slaughtered in front of you, I invite you to take the long view. Practice some forgiveness. Pretend that the people who did it had good reasons for it."</DefaultText>
