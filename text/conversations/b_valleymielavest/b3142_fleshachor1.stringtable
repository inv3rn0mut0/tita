      <DefaultText>Several people have been flayed, their skins stretched into grotesque banners, faces contorted in a rictus of eternal pain. The skins flap back and forth in a wind you do not feel. Beyond them, you see a clear passage deeper into this hell.

Suddenly a pair of eyes snaps open. These are not flayed skins, but living people!

"Kill us," it rasps. "The Children brought us here, not to die, but to *suffer*. To feed the *things* that live here... slowly, eternally."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Kill us!" one of them rasps again.

Another groans. "No, you will only make those we feed grow stronger."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your blade tears through them like paper. Their screams echo through the mist, blood spraying on the floor and your flesh. Then it's over. They are gone - truly released - and the path before you is clear.

{SOUND: Horrible screams.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These skins are like the other you met - alive and in eternal pain. One of them snaps its eyes open as you approach. "Kill us. Do not leave us here to die slowly."

"No..." A second moans behind him. "When we die, they grow stronger. Better to run. Save yourself!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No!" The skin behind the first - partially obscured in the dark mist - shakes herself awake. Her face remains twisted in agony even as she speaks. "Our deaths make them stronger! If you kill us, you will only die here as well. Run! Save yourself!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There is only death." A third voice moans from the darkness behind the first two. Its eyes remain closed, its mouth gnarled in an ugly grimace. "Kill us or the Children... or both... or neither. It does not matter. Death is all that awaits you."

The three skins squeeze their eyes shut. Their mouths open in wordless screams as some new agony befalls them.

A malevolent presence weighs down upon you. Something watches with eager anticipation. It almost *wants* you to kill them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pressure around you becomes so great you clap your hands to your ears. Even through the flesh of your palms you hear cruel cackling and a single word.

      <DefaultText>Some pressure around you squeezes and loosens in bursts, until you realize it's the air itself... laughing. Whatever lives here has grown stronger still.</DefaultText>
