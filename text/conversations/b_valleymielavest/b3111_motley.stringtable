      <DefaultText>Stunted and piebald with a large, hairless head, this humanoid reminds you of a court jester. But unlike those half-wits, his wide violet eyes sparkle with cunning and intelligence, and you wonder what's going on in his large dome. "You there! Halt!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why did you come here?" Several people sit bound and beaten along the far wall, surrounded by corpses. At second glance, some of those who are sitting upright may themselves be dead, as well. The man in front of you moves to block your view of them, stepping closer and lowering his voice to a growl.

"Well? Answer me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why did you come here?" A large number of corpses are strewn across the floor and against the far wall. He moves to block your view of them, stepping closer and lowering his voice to a growl.

      <DefaultText>"Wait." He looks you up and down in wonderment, noting your armor and weapons. "We could use someone like you. We've been locked out of a place that's very dear to us, and we've had to resort to such unfortunate measures in our attempts to seek a resolution." He steps back, giving you full view of the bodies along the far wall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances behind him and grimaces. "Have you ever been betrayed by a false friend, someone whose every promise is a lie?" He searches your face for an answer.

"Of course you have. It's the nature of this cruel world we live in. And so often, it seems, when we need help the most, Fate abandons us..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>He rubs the back of his neck and looks away. "Sometimes this world can just beat you down again and again until you don't think you'll ever get back up. I confess, in my desperation, I..." He seems unable to go on, overcome with regret.

"I just needed one of them to help me. Someone, anyone, to give me a helping hand. If only..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks around, comprehension dawning on his face as he takes in the room and its contents.

"It's not what you think," he says fervently. "We were just defending ourselves, trying to reclaim what small part of this world Fate has seen fit to cede us. It never would have come to this if we'd only had someone to help us explain..."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>He bows his head. "Of course. I understand. But I will have to ask that you respect the necessities of our position and only return once you've made your decision. Is this acceptable to you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Patience, Jaelyn," the man says, holding up a hand for silence. "Our friends here are just deciding whose side they'd rather be on." He turns his attention back to you.

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>All semblance of friendliness leaves his face, the mask of the well-meaning man falling away so completely that the person in front of you seems alien by comparison.

"As you will it," he snarls. "Your body will feed the Gate as well as any."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One of our martyrs is entombed here. We make a habit of leaving offerings for him daily, but since the Memorialists locked us out we haven't been able to reach him." He sighs heavily. "I understand that some people don't see spirituality as a need or an obligation, but for some of us it's as vital as breath."</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>A strange light kindles in the man's piggish eyes. "That could be arranged. If you would be willing to give the bodies over to us afterward." He pats you paternally on the arm. "We'll talk about it later."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Where to begin?" He falls quiet, considering. "We came to the Valley quite recently, called here by the voice of our Lord. We hadn't heard from  him in many years, so naturally we were anxious to be reunited with him." He smiles briefly. "Not in the physical sense, of course, but in spirit."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We arrived and set about consecrating those elements of our faith that had been unable to make the journey with us. We had just re-established contact and were in a state of communion when this group - the Memorialists - deemed our faith..." He bows his head quickly. "Undeserving."</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They - or, more accurately, a lady named Talira - locked the controls that allowed us to visit the tomb of our savior. We've been trying to negotiate with them since, but it seems they respond to nothing less than physical harm." He shakes his head. "My people are good people. None of us want to be here, and none of us want to hurt anyone. We just want to be left alone to practice our faith." He falls silent, staring at the locked pedestal.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That Dendra child?" the man hisses, his face flushing deep red. "She told you about us?" He runs a hand across his bald pate. "Of course she did. It's exactly the kind of behavior I should have expected."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Rest assured, I will be speaking with her on the virtues of secrecy," he says darkly. "As soon as we have regained our access to Lord Inifere. I'd wager she's whispering secrets to him as we speak." The color of his complexion deepens.

"We must access the Gate, now!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She clearly knows better than to show her face around here." He barks a short, mirthless laugh. "It may be the smartest decision she's ever made." He looks you up and down, noting some aspect of your demeanor. "Still, perhaps she saw something in you that has yet to be revealed. Lord Inifere will know." He gestures uselessly at a pedestal behind him. "But first we must regain access to the Gate."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Still, your arrival is fortuitous," he says, eyeing your weapons and armor. "We need someone who can walk among the Memorialists unrecognized. Without such a person to help us, we will never regain access to the Gate and Lord Inifere." He gestures at a nearby pedestal in frustration.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He speaks slowly, weighing each word. "They're a splinter religion. I wouldn't say a cult, but..." His eyes drift to the woman leaning against the far wall, her hands and feet bound with thick cords. "They believe this world is the afterlife, and that if each person could remember who they were, it would become a paradise." His half-smile dares you to laugh.</DefaultText>

      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Naturally, they don't regard human life too highly. The fewer people there are who have yet to remember, the fewer people they need to convince." He shrugs eloquently. "Couple that with occasional outbreaks of violence within their own ranks and you have a broad overview of their philosophy. You can see why we had to restrain them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I imagine whoever sent you spun a tale of darkness and fates worse than death?" He shakes his head. "I've heard it from tens of other good souls who wanted to vanquish the evil coiled in the belly of the Necropolis. It gets a little tiring, if I can be the one to say so."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She," he points at a woman near the far wall who's bound at both wrists and ankles. "She's the one who started all this. She locked the pedestal, she locked us away from our most sacred site, and for what?" He turns to you, a pained expression on his face.

"All because we follow a different ideology. Theological differences should never be settled by blood! Help us. Please."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Some of them, we had to put down." Hesitantly, he steps aside, giving you full view of the bodies along the wall. "Those three," he points at men wearing armor instead of robes, "happened upon the lady there and were taken in by her lies. They refused to desert her, even when her deception was made clear." He turns to you, a pained look on his face.

      <DefaultText>"What this one says is true," Klin'Kar admits, stepping forward and fixing the man before you with his gaze. "I had thought they could be of assistance, since they proved themselves sympathetic to our cause." The man turns to look at him. Klin'Kar retreats. Nevertheless, the tension in the room abates somewhat.</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Did he now?" He regards you with a dead gaze, devoid of curiosity. "How very kind." He considers you in a long, unbroken silence. Eventually, he turns to look at a nearby pedestal instead.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You'll forgive me if I test your sympathies a little further," he murmurs. "One can't be too careful these days." He gestures to the pedestal behind him.

"That spherical lock was placed there by our enemies, the Memorialists. They're rather narrow-sighted, and don't see the value in what we do. If we regain our access to the Gate, we can show them firsthand." He smiles. The effect is not reassuring.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I need you to figure out the word that codes the whisperlock," he says, watching your face closely. "We've tried asking them, but, well..." With a shrug he indicates the bodies - and living prisoners - along the far wall.

      <DefaultText>He turns to look at the people ranged along the wall. Then he turns back to you, clearly dismissing them.

      <DefaultText>He steeples his fingers in front of his mouth and regards you for a few moments before replying.

      <DefaultText>Motley stares up at you in dumb amazement.

"Truly?" He regains his feet, brushing the dust of the Necropolis from his robe with chagrin. "You are far more lenient than our Lord. Perhaps we can serve you as well, some day. At the very least we could introduce you, if we are ever abe to see him again."</DefaultText>

Without a word, Isalu draws one of her daggers and plunges it into Jaelyn's chest. With barely more than a sigh, Jaelyn collapses to the floor, enshrined in a rapidly growing pool of her own blood.
