      <DefaultText>"Hello." This young man smiles up at you shyly, his left eye sealed shut by a combination of grime and blood. The rest of his body hasn't fared much better, and the cords around his wrists and ankles have rubbed his flesh raw. He sees you staring and shakes his head so hair falls over his ruined eye.

"Can I help you?" he asks politely.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm Jenkins! Jenkins the Jinxed!" He wrinkles his nose. "It wasn't my first choice of name, believe me. But I don't really mind it anymore. It's kind of... apt." He looks you over, then shuffles forward a little, leaning closer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, we came across the Wastes," he says pensively. "The Verxulian Wastes, of course, not the Tempest Wastes." He laughs lightly, as if at his own joke. "Then Narve pushed Utwag down a sand dune and he tumbled into this gravestone valley. Almost broke his neck. I'm glad he didn't though."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We came across the Wastes, Narve pushed Utwag down a hill, and we helped Talira lock the Necropolis. Then the cultists found us." He shrugs and rolls his eyes in the universal gesture for 'what can you do?'.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The red-haired one is Utwag Los, our leader. He's been all over the world, you know - he's famous!" Jenkins gives you a nod, his face serious, as if to impress upon you the gravity of the situation. "The other fellow is Narve. He tries to hurt people, but it never turns out right."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Utwag Los and Narve the Blessed. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say we're at your service."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then..." He pauses, searching his memory. "We ran into these Memorialists who asked for our help. They wanted to lock the Necropolis from these cultists. Of *course* I said yes, but well... we weren't so lucky. But at least we kept them out!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He cranes his neck so he can see the terminal, moving around until he can get a good look at it.

"Yup. Still locked," he says, with an air of satisfaction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're bound and bruised, and you ask if I need help?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah." He looks at the cords that bind him, testing them experimentally. "I mean, I know you're probably right. But couldn't you need help anyway?" He looks up at you hopefully. "Maybe... Just a little bit of help?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Actually, I do need to know the passcode for the whisperlock."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not at the moment, thanks."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>His face brightens and he nods at you enthusiastically. "Excellent! As *soon* as I learn what it is, I will tell you!"

He catches your expression. A sad look comes on his face. "Oh. You hoped I knew it already. Sorry, friend." He gives you a sudden broad smile. "But if you need anything else, you know exactly where I'll be!" He holds his bound hands toward you.

"Here. I'll be here. Just so we understand each other."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I see." He nods wisely. "Well, if you ever need a helping hand... A helping pair of bound hands... I'll be right here." He beams up at you, apparently unaffected by his own words. "Just so you know."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not exactly, no." He keeps looking up at you, squinting and turning his head from side to side. "Just remember I'll be right here if you have anything that needs doing, all right? I won't disappoint. In fact, I'm quite good at it!" He beams up at you.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You see, I really like to help people, but I have a habit of getting lost," he says in what he clearly thinks is a whisper. "I'll camp down for the night with my party, and by morning they'll all be gone!" He stares up at you in wide-eyed wonderment. "It's a terrible curse, really it is." He kicks at the floor, and sighs.

"Utwag and Narve are the only people I never lost," he says morosely.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I think you and I are going to get along splendidly," Erritis says.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>Jenkins seems momentarily taken aback, and ducks his head shyly.

"You're the first person ever to say that to me," he says, sniffling and wiping at his eyes. Erritis leans down and clasps him on the shoulder, and the two of them bask silently in mutual affection.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not for lack of trying."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Don't worry, Narve, I'll never try to lose you!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What?" His eyes widen and he looks around worriedly. "I don't... I don't hurt people."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>He smiles and leans in toward you. "I like him."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>He brightens. "Of course I... Oh, no. No, I haven't."

He slumps in despair. "I really am helpful. I mean usually."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're lucky he can't help you. More trouble than it's worth. *Believe* me."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What? Helping people is never trouble, and it's *always* worth it." He gives a kind smile.</DefaultText>

He catches your expression. A sad look comes on his face. "Oh. You hoped I knew it already. Sorry, friend." He gives you a sudden broad smile. "But if you need anything else, you know exactly where I'll be!" He looks around the room then back at you.
