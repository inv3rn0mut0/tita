      <DefaultText>This stout fellow has a cruel scowl and beady eyes. He is unkempt and dressed in clothes that don't quite fit. In a low, gruff voice, he seems to be muttering to himself about some plot or other going wrong. His hands are bound behind his back and are constantly working at the cords, as if they have a life of their own.

He keeps glancing at the nearby corpse of a young man. Occasionally, he takes the time to spit on it before returning his attention to the cords that bind him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hey, laak-nibber! Why'nt you come show me that pretty knife of yours up close? Are you afraid I can take you with both hands behind my back?" None of the guards show any indication of having heard him, but he smiles to himself nonetheless.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're the one who's useless," Narve says to the guard, working at his bonds. "If you'd had any sense you would've killed Utwag first and let the rest of us go. Do you hear me?" The guard says nothing, and Narve subsides, muttering to himself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Narve." He scowls. "Only I'm not the Blessed anymore, not since that idiot lopped it." He kicks at a nearby corpse, unleashing a fresh tide of bright red blood.

"I've got a lot of catching up to do," he sighs. "Gotta even the score."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm an explorer and a villain. The worst villain you'll ever meet! And by that I mean that no matter what I try to pull, it somehow ends up *helping* people." He spits. "Blessed indeed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We came across the Wastes, chasing numenera. It was all part of my plot to kill Utwag when he least expected it." He sneers at the red-headed man. "But they went and killed Jenkins first, and now he's all torn up. I'd say I enjoyed watching him suffer, but it's only really fun if I caused it. Bunch of amateurs," he mutters.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was all Utwag's idea. Chasing something shiny for the sake of a pretty face isn't my style. So we came across the Wastes and stumbled into this lot, who've been holding us captive ever since. Still, it got Jenkins killed, so some good came of it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>He leans forward and talks to you in low tones. "It was all Utwag's fault. Gods-damned do-gooder can't help himself. We're on a 'quest,' he calls it, for this fabled string or whatever. I figure it's my chance to off him once and for all. We came across this enormous broken hound, so I tossed a few rocks at it to get its attention. Well, Utwag wouldn't fight it or run, no. He calmed it down and left it alone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just another frayed end of the string that is my 'blessed' failures."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The red-headed fellow, he's Utwag Los." In a hushed tone he adds, "I've been trying to kill him for about twelve years now."

He looks at one of the bodies on the floor, his voice carefully flat. "That one was called Jenkins the Jinxed. He'd help anyone, if you let him." He sighs. "Look where it got him."</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, Jenkins is laak food, which leaves me and Utwag. And *her*." There's no mistaking who he means or the hatred in his tone. Talira bows her head, in either shame or denial.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The red-headed fellow, he's Utwag Los." In a hushed tone he adds, "I've been trying to kill him for about twelve years now."

He leans back and indicates the smooth-faced man. "And the young pup there is Jenkins the Jinxed. He'll want to help you. Don't let him."

He leers at the young man, who smiles back at him as if he'd just said the nicest thing.</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The red-headed one's Utwag and the dumb-looking one's Jenkins. Don't ask why I'm still with them. I haven't figured it out yet."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So I tried a second time, shoving Utwag down a mountain side when he got too close. As luck would have it, I lost my balance and fell down with him. 'Course idiot Jenkins follows us to help." He puffs out a blast of air.

"That's how we got to this valley. When these Memorialists asked for our help, We all saw an opportunity - Jenkins to help, Utwag to grow on his 'path' or whatever, and me to finally do Utwag in."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head sadly. "Then those cultists caught us before I could try anything. I tell you, nothing *ever* goes my way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This stout fellow has a cruel scowl and beady eyes. He sits facing the wall, his back to the corpses that surround him. He is unkempt and dressed in clothes that don't quite fit. In a low, gruff voice, he seems to be muttering to himself about some plot or other going wrong. His hands are bound behind his back and are constantly working at the cords, as if they have a life of their own.

Occasionally he sighs and falls still, looking more beaten than mere bruises could have caused.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He should have let me kill him," he mutters. "I told him it was going to end the same way regardless, but he just wouldn't listen. Well, who's the fool now? Ha!" He leans forward briefly and you hear him breathe in. It's a ragged, gulping sound.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Talira. She's a memorialist." He spits in the dust at her feet. She doesn't react. He cranes his neck backward to look up at you.

"What good is protecting the memories of the dead when you won't help save the people who are living and breathing in front of you?" He hears his own words and scowls, facing the wall once more.

"I should've had the chance to kill 'em myself," he mutters, half-heartedly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why? What're you going to do? Kill me?" Narve chortles to himself. "Hey, Utwag, you hear that one? Pretty good, right?"

Utwag grunts noncommittally.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His voice is carefully flat. "The red-headed fellow, he was Utwag Los. I'd been trying to kill him for, oh..." He looks up, considering. "About twelve years now. The cultists denied me the pleasure. The other was called Jenkins the Jinxed. He'd help anyone, if you let him." He sighs. "Look where it got him."</DefaultText>
