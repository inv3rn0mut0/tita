      <DefaultText>This small alcove is about the size of a small hovel. Its sole virtue is that it is a shelter from the wind and from the sightlines of casual passers-by. 

The runes carved above its entrance fill your mind with a wordless message of catastrophic danger.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Erritis cradles his forehead in his hands. He mouths the word 'no,' then swallows, shaking his head. He seems... smaller than you recall. 

"I don't... I don't like this place." His voice is a whisper. His hands fall to his eyes, and he touches them, as if they are in pain. "Are we leaving? I want to leave."</DefaultText>

After a moment's reflection, you recognize the nature of the runes. They are ancient warnings set here to discourage the unwary, and create a psychic burden capable of communicating to nearly any lifeform in the world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dust inside the alcove is undisturbed apart from a set of footprints that circles the interior. Their owner appears to have curled up in a corner, under a ledge containing a small, ebony box.

The dust on that ledge has also been disturbed - someone removed something long and thin, like a blade, from this place. In its place is a crudely-carved herder's crook.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The alcove remains much as you left it - a narrow line of footprints carved into the layer of dust on the floor. An open ebony box lies on the shelf before you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Huh. I've slept in worse places. Still, seems like a strange spot to curl up in."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks carefully at the scuff marks in the dust, and takes a quick visual inventory. "Whoever slept here was short - probably no more than a teen's size - and likely male. Not a great place to spend the night. Terrifying, probably."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>She picks up the box and her eyes widen momentarily. "This is not ornamental. It was built to hold something dangerous within... something alive, by the look, and some fool cracked it open. It's worthless now."

She dusts her hands off. "None of my sisters see anything useful here. Let's go." She shivers a bit. "None of us would like to spend any more time here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Someone slept here, didn't they? They wanted to hide, but they didn't know how to hide." She puts her hand in her pocket nervously. "I hope they found someplace better to go. This doesn't feel like a place to stay. It feels like... hunger."

She hugs herself. "Let's go. I don't like this place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes. Later." He swallows. "Not here. Please. We should go."</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No. I don't like this place." His face is tight and drawn. "It tastes like a nightmare."

He scrubs his hands across his eyes. "Can we please leave?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nothing," He swallows hard. "I don't want to say. Not here. Please. I'm begging you. Let's go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I remember this place." His voice cracks again. As it runs dry, the glow seems to evaporate before his face. 

"There was... someone else. A boy." Erritis's features soften.

"He was tired. Scared. Not at all like me. He came to this place... and when he fell asleep there... he never woke up. The sleep buried him, and he screamed, still screams..." 

Erritis's voice cracks again, and he swallows. "I can hear it. When all things are quiet."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> He presses the heels of his trembling hands against his eyes. </DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't remember!" he screams. "It was a nightmare, a stupid story, and nothing heroic happened. It was a waste of time, and I don't know why I remember!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Some... farm boy. A herder. He chose the wrong place to sleep. The wrong time to follow his curiosity. He's frightened all the time now."

He raps on his forehead with his knuckles. "Who was he... who was he..."

And then...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The alcove remains much as you last saw it. The only new disturbances in the dust are the footprints you left.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>You stretch out your hand to take the crook. Beside you, Erritis moans. 

A wave of pale fire explodes from the crook, and everything goes white. You hear screaming - perhaps Erritis's, perhaps your own. Thunderous voices bellow beyond the hissing wail of that endless ivory wall, and something is rushing at you, something that you can't see-</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is no sign of what this empty box once held, but you do note a carving of an eye at the bottom of the box with a pupil made of two crimson, concentric rings. If you squint, you can just make out a human figure at the center of the eye, holding a sword in the air. </DefaultText>

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>You find nothing new inside the box. Just the etched eye at the bottom with the tiny, sword-waving figure at the center of a two-ringed pupil. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Erritis groans, and you look over. An untroubled smile graces his face, but you notice that one of his eyes is watering. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>You casually reach out to take the crook.

A white-hot bolt of energy strikes at your hand like a snake. There is no pain, but your entire arm goes momentarily numb. 

The energy races up through you, passing across your mind and out your other arm to merge back into the unassuming crook. You hear the echoes of voices, too soft to hear, leaving you only with the sense of what was said. 

*Not yours*. That is the message they burned into your mind with rapidly fading letters. *Stay away*.

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>A fistful of senses, emotions, memories, and *fear*, strikes your mind, driving you back a step along the dusty floor of the alcove. Something has changed inside you... inside the Labyrinth. You hear a voice in your mind - a voice very much like Erritis's - but small and afraid.

You look over at him.</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>The crude wooden herder's crook rests behind the box. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Another bolt of light lashes out at your hand, making your arm go numb.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>You blink the spots out of your eyes. If this crook is not yours, than it must belong to someone. Maybe you'd have better luck here if you returned with the owner. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Erritis is staring at the shelf, hands slack at his side. The glow is nowhere to be seen and he looks weathered. Weary. Old.

You follow his gaze. The herder's crook is gone.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Let's go, Erritis."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>He nods. Swallows. Nods again. 

His glow returns slowly, like the sun dawning behind a hill. As he turns away, his eyes fix momentarily on your forehead, stricken and sad, before the glow fills them too, and he smiles. 

"Why are we standing in this boring alcove?" he says, looking around. "We should be fighting! Feasting! Jumping from roof to roof. Let's go find some roofs!" He gasps. "Is *this* a roof?!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"What just happened?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I went somewhere," he mumbles without looking at you. "I stayed here in my amazing, heroic body but I went somewhere *else*."

Without looking at you, his hand lifts from his side and points at your forehead. He does not seem to be aware that his hand is doing this. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>Then, his glow returns like the sun rising behind a hill, and swallows him. He smiles, dropping his rebellious hand.

"Why are we just *standing* here?" he says, looking around. "We should be fighting! Feasting! Jumping from roof to roof. Let's go find some roofs!" He gasps. "Is *this* a roof?!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Look away. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>You turn from Erritis and resume your examination of the alcove as a whole. </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, very," he says, nodding at you. A tear streaks down his narrow cheek, and around his cheerful grin. "But bored here, now that you ask. We should leave. We should leave *now*."

He whistles quietly to himself, and looks away. </DefaultText>
