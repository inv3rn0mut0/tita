      <DefaultText>"It's entirely possible. The Tides are a psychic force, and when we're... born... our minds snap into a particular shape and force out the residue. An unprotected mind nearby might well absorb some of that energy and react in unpredictable ways. But what of it? Does this change anything in your life? Two mortals had an argument, oh no.

I have experienced so many lives in memories, and one of the common threads in all of them is pain. Do we hurt other people? We do. But how do we differ from any mortal in this regard? Show me someone without pain and I will show you a corpse."

      <DefaultText>"Because of what we are. It's ineffable. No point in trying to understand it. Just... avoid it if you can. But realize that the depths you might have to delve to succeed, well... you might have your own batch of castoffs cursing your name."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He adjusts one of the tubes on his outfit. "I worry more about the deaths of others, and how I might gain some of their knowledge. Not about the First's dead vendetta, nor our creator's desire to kill us, nor certainly not an unstoppable monster from the past."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Focus. I'll teach you to direct that power, shape it, draw from it."

He belches, and a thin green film coats his chin before he wipes it away. "Eh. Danger of eating brains... sometimes you get an infected one. No worries. It'll clear up in a few days. Castoff constitution. Now." 

He strokes your cheek with a long finger. The world shivers around you. "You have seen a Merecaster, yes? The process is similar, but you focus upon *yourself*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do not empty your mind. A subtle difference - *clear* it. Feel the ebb and swirl of the Tidal energy. Look at your hand."

As he speaks, your vision blurs, replaced by a kaleidoscopic tapestry of writhing, twisting colors just above your skin, a roadmap of vibrant, vascular life.

"Now," whispers Melmoth, "imagine that energy flowing into your hand."

You do... and the colors coalesce in your palm.

      <DefaultText>"See? You *see*? The Tides respond to you. They are a part of you, and you can make that force *work* for you. If you push them outward slowly, you can coil them around someone's mind and bend them to your will. You can focus them like a bolt, or you can *explode*."

He pulls his hand away and your vision returns to normal.

"But you must *practice*. The knowledge is inherent in you. It is a part of your body. Now you've seen it, the question is... will you use it?"

"The lesson is over."

      <DefaultText>He scoffs. "Would you rather learn from someone who spends her immortal life driving slaves, or from someone who has made the acquisition of knowledge his purpose?"

He belches suddenly, and a thin green film coats his chin before he wipes it away. "Eh. Danger of eating brains... sometimes you get an infected one. No worries. It'll clear up in a few days. Castoff constitution. Now."

      <DefaultText>"You know they're a psychic energy field. They pervade the greater Sagus Protectorate. But the pockets of Tidal activity are *localized* in the Ninth World. That suggests that though they're a natural force, they're also artificially induced. Civilizations have risen around their use."

He taps his head. "That's why I sought a better method. You get the occasional disease, a strong mind that doesn't want to share its memories with you, but everyone wants to be remembered. Talk to the voices long enough, they realize you're their only true heir." </DefaultText>
