      <DefaultText>This section of wall is covered with symbols from floor to ceiling. Peering upward, you can faintly make out more symbols stretching above you, and sweeping away millennia of dust from the crook of the wall reveals that the etching continues under your feet.

There's something about the placement of the symbols on the wall that hints at a pattern as yet undiscovered.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You spend some time peering closely at each of the symbols in turn, trying to discern their meaning in relation to each other. However, it's only when you step back, your eyes slightly unfocused, that the pattern becomes clear.

The symbols are arranged in multiples of six, with each cluster forming a point in another set of six. The visual effect is oddly disorienting, an outward spiral of ever-increasing magnitude that soon encompasses not only the Necropolis but the universe itself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You lose yourself for a moment in the overwhelming symmetry of all that is and ever was. Eventually some survival instinct triggers deep within your subconscious, bringing you back to your body with a physical jolt.

The wall before you hasn't changed, but it now exudes a malignant sense of something entirely *other*, a knowledge and method of thinking that can only be described as completely alien. Whatever built these halls knew nothing of humanity. Perhaps it's just as well.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You spend some time mapping the symbols in your head, trying to relate the symbols to other patterns in the world, but get nowhere. Their arrangement is as arcane as ever.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stare at the symbols again, but come away only with the beginnings of a headache.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You try to focus on the symbols again, to re-experience the vertigo that took you beyond the edges of all human thought. But no matter how hard you strain your eyes, your gaze slides off the symbols and away from the pattern as some deep-seated survival instinct silently takes hold.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This expanse of wall has been rippled by time or heat. In sections where the wall is smooth it's impossible to tell by touch alone where each symbol starts and ends. In the place where the rock has been tempered, however, the edges of some of the symbols just barely protrude from the wall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The carving in these places is sharp enough that you inadvertently open a razor-thin incision in your index finger without even realizing. When you draw your hand away from the wall, bright blood blooms just beneath the surface of your skin, staining your fingertip red.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Careful of the warped symbols in the rippled expanse of the wall, you trace your fingers over the symbols once again, but find no further insights.</DefaultText>
