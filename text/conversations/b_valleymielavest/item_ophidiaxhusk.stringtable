      <DefaultText>For an instant you see a whirl of images in your mind, answers to questions you had not yet thought to ask, but they quickly fade from view. An odd sense of kinship suffuses you as you touch the material. It calls out to you, promising more than meets the eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You experiment twisting the material in different ways, slowly massaging it into a bracelet shape. As it nears completion, the object leaps out of your hands as if by its own volition, quickly wrapping around your wrist and locking its ends in place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You experiment twisting the material in different ways, trying to slowly massage it into a bracelet shape. The material resists your attempts stubbornly, and as you try to force it, it leaps out of your hands with a biting sensation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The whirl of images you glimpsed before slows down. It appears to tell a tale of long voyage between worlds, though the story told is so strange that it's impossible to puzzle out the exact sequence of events.

As the images settle down into a regular pace, they seem to pull you in, trying to force the experiences and knowledge it has stored into your mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The images are a whirl of glimpses at strange dimensions, seen through the eyes of someone that does not seem to be human. They do not tell a story in any traditional sense, the whole more of an experience than anything else. Through it, you gain an emotional understanding of the dimensional traveler, a being of cold, dispassionate logic.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The images flash and whirl before you faster and faster, raging like a storm before your eyes. And yet, they leave an impression of a calm, rational being. You center yourself and respond with an equal measure of dispassionate distance, and the images respond in kind, slowing down and finally dissipating.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The strip of cloth unfurls itself back into its original state, but now it completely resists any attempt to twist or manipulate it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While visually the same as before, the material is now unpliable and resistant to any manipulation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Such a small thing, and yet its sting was enough for your tired constitution. You are drifting out of consciousness, dimly aware the material wrapped itself around your wrist and is trying to impart its knowledge on you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Too weak to resist, images are forced into your mind, flashing and raging through your brain... Yet there is a clarity to it. With the sense of detachment granted only to the dying, you watch the stitched together travel log of a powerful transdimensional being. This traveler moved from world to world for a timespan most humans would find hard to grasp, surviving and moving by a force of will given to him by a cold, dispassionate logic.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you slip away, you are granted a deep yet fleeting sense of understanding imparted by this being, who seems to comprehend - though not sympathize with - your travails.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Inspecting the material more closely, it appears to be strong, but flexible. It looks like the two ends of the ragged material can be attached to one another. It occurs to you the material can be twisted and tied in upon itself with a bit of manual dexterity to form a bracelet.</DefaultText>
