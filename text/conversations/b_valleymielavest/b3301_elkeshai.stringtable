      <DefaultText>This slim castoff looks to be in his late teens. He carries an odd-looking device that resembles a scorched circle, and it's not hard to draw the connection between it and the red mark of a recent injury that travels along his forehead and under his hair. 

The man seems confused, hesitant, as if he has so many questions that he isn't sure which to ask first.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You forced your way through our portal," he says. "It kept us safe from the Sorrow. Now it's open."

He swallows, eyeing you reproachfully. Carefully. You feel a stirring of forces around you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He blinks hard at your question, twisting the blackened circlet through his hands. 

"I once f-fought in the Endless Battle. F-found this in a giant clay hand. Trapped in a half-shattered block of stone. I took it." He shakes his head, as if denying the memory itself. "Put it on."

The circlet spins through his hands, faster and faster. "I saw darkness. Knew I was inside the owner of that hand. A clay automaton, imprisoned. Knew I could control it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shivers. "I did. Broke it free from the stone. Used it in service of our sire for many years. Thought of it as my armor." He blinks hard again, like a man trying to dislodge a thought with his eyelids alone.

"Then. A war construct collapsed on the automaton. Crushed it. And the crown burned. I r-remember screaming. Then a hundred voices in my head. Arguing with each other. Shouting. Fighting."

Another hard blink. "The automaton wasn't armor. It was a container. A container for gods."</DefaultText>
