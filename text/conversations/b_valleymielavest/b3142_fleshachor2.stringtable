      <DefaultText>[First intro: description of flesh anchor, it asks you to kill it for some reason (pain, joy, apathy) different from the other flesh anchors. Sense that doing so will help you in the short term by opening a path, but will also strengthen the Lurker.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Leave us. Leave this place," one of them moans. "You cannot defeat what rules here."

"Though if you will not be turned," says another, "the path *through* us is quicker."

"And more dangerous," groans the first. "You would give them strength against you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your blade slides through them like melting butter. Their screams turn to gurgling death rattles, while their blood sprays you head to toe.

Then it's over. They are gone - truly released - and the path before you is clear.

      <DefaultText>The pressure around you becomes so great you clap your hands to your ears. Even through the flesh of your palms you hear cruel cackling and a single word.

      <DefaultText>Some pressure around you squeezes and loosens in bursts, until you realize it's the air itself... laughing. Whatever lives here has grown stronger still.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Several people have been flayed, their skins stretched into grotesque banners, faces contorted in a rictus of eternal pain. The skins flap back and forth in a wind you do not feel. Beyond them, you see a clear passage deeper into this hell.

Suddenly a pair of eyes snaps open. These are not flayed skins, but living people!

"Kill us," it rasps. "The Children brought us here. They would keep you here, too! Kill us and create a quicker path for yourself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No!" The skin behind the first - partially obscured in the dark mist - shakes herself awake. Her face remains twisted in agony even as she speaks. "They brought us here to feed *them*. Now we feed them slowly, eternally. But our deaths will feed them all at once, making them stronger than ever! You cannot face them then."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh," says the first skin, although in its agony it sounds like a pained "ooooohhhh."

"So you will die either way. As will we. It is better for you to flee then. Get out of here before they find you and you join us here."

The skins squeeze their eyes shut. Their mouths open in wordless screams as some new agony befalls them.

A malevolent presence weighs down upon you. Something watches with eager anticipation. It almost *wants* you to kill them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These skins are like the others you met - alive and in eternal pain. One of them snaps its eyes open as you approach. "Kill us. You will reach the center more quickly."

"No..." A second moans behind him. "When we die, they grow stronger. You will never survive!"</DefaultText>
