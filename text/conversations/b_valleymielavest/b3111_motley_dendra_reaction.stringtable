      <DefaultText>"Hey!" Motley strides over, his robe flapping around his ankles. "Get away from there!" He takes in your bloodied mouth with disgust.

"That flesh belongs to Lord Inifere," he hisses, piggish eyes bulging. "Dendra usurper! I will take him your corpse as restitution!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He considers you for a moment, bloody lips and all.

"Well put," he eventually says. His lip curls in distaste. "Just be quick about it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The color drains from Motley's face. "I would *never* question Lord Inifere!" He raises his hands in a placating gesture. "You do whatever you must to ensure his return. I'll make sure the rest of us stay out of the way." He hurries back to the pedestal, snapping his fingers at the other cultists.

"You two! Make sure no one disturbs our friend!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"About as well as he'd respond to yours," Motley counters. His face flushes with sudden fury. "You're not one of us! You're one of *them*!" He turns to yell at his companions.

"We have to protect Lord Inifere!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Motley is stunned into silence by your rebuke. Then he blinks and the cunning is back in his face.

"Very well," he declares magnanimously. "Just be quick about it." He returns to the pedestal at a more measured pace.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fine words," he sneers, "from a liar's tongue. We'll take you to Lord Inifere ourselves!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I know, but..." His voice takes on a whining, wheedling quality. "Why *her*? Among us, surely she is the least faithful." He realizes his error the moment it leaves his mouth.

"Of course, I'm not questioning you or Lord Inifere." He makes soothing motions with his hands. "Just a moment of weakness. It won't happen again." He walks slowly back toward the pedestal, back stiff.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Kiyatawa said that?" His lip curls in a sneer, but his voice has lost some of its bite. "That Dendra child is the last one I would be taking orders from." He considers you for a moment, bloody mouth and all.
 
"Once we regain access to the Gate we will take this matter before Lord Inifere. Until then, watch yourself." He returns to the pedestal at a pace that makes it clear he, and no one else, is in charge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's nothing to talk about." His voice deepens into a snarl.  "If you're one of them, you're not one of us." He turns to yell at his companions.

      <DefaultText>He stops, mid-rant, regarding you with a dull gleam in his piggish eyes.

"Is it, now?" he asks, grinning slowly. "In that case, we don't need you, Dendra spawn!"</DefaultText>
