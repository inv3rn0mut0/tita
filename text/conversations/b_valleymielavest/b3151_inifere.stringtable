      <DefaultText>This man is long-limbed and bony, unmuscled, with a sunken chest. Sparse hair on a scarred scalp. Rags hang from his slumping body. He wears the castoff tattoo, but he's like no castoff you've seen.

He regards you with bloodshot eyes, fever-mad. But just as the pupils remain black and pure amid the veins, you sense something hard and sane within the madness.

His words are hoarse and dangerous. "You've come too far. Too far by far. There is no escape. *None* leave the gate."

Few of time's grinding grains have fallen upon you. You stand straight, with fine features, unworn by years, unwarned by fears."

Ruined teeth are bared in an unhappy grin. "But I've lived longer, little brother, awash in wasting sand, and I wish to live longer still, in life's still, distilled to spite, the essence of senescence."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Inifere asks question.]

{JOBY/MARK: This is really more for Mark (though Joby can pre-structure the conversation to better accommodate it), but I'd rather see it as the player choosing to say the right things, rather than answering riddles. (Plus I don't know if Inifere is coherent enough to ask questions - he's kind of insane).

So something like:
[Inifere is wary, but is listening.]
PR: I know you don't want the cultists to kill people.
[Inifere listens more.]
PR: Marcysa... you loved her didn't you.
[Inifere nods, not trusting himself to say words.]
PR: I can help you. I can change what happened to Marcysa. Just let me into your Merecaster.
[Inifere reluctantly agrees.]

Of course these would require other non-winning options as well (or alternative winning options might be okay too - whatever seems most fun for the player). -AH}</DefaultText>

Your brother shrugs. "A woman. A mortal. Blood to bleed, skin to flay, a hoarse voice to howl holy horror unto the Children. A fool. A hook in my flesh. A fraud. A corpse to molder."

His voice softens. "Time has laid her low. Time will level her farther still. She was one thing, and now she's another, and so on, even for us, little brother."</DefaultText>

Oh, what sweaty oaths we swore, heaving beneath the sheets, sweet, sweat, wet, weeping, eh, brother? Love! *Love*!" he pants the word.

"Love." Inifere shakes his head. "You are naive and young. Father left the part that loves in the waste when he carved our flesh. We are dry and barren and she was a harrow on my fallow heart."</DefaultText>

He returns to the moment, licks his lips, gestures at the hellscape around you. "This is the womb that wounds but welcomes home an alien brood, shelter from the Sorrow that shadows our blood."</DefaultText>

Inifere leans in and whispers conspiratorially. "Did Father know their name? Did he dream who'd answer his call? Or did he, too, blindly blunder through the dark?" He shrugs. "No matter. It's done."

      <DefaultText>Inifere's breathing slows and a sad smile comes to his face. "You know. You chose." 

He shudders as if taken by a chill, and then you feel it, the Tides moving, swirling around your brother. He is pulling on them, and through them, on you, pulling down safeguards you never knew you had. There is something - something terrible - just beyond the limits of your senses, and those limits are being erased as your mind vastens and slops among the Tides.

      <DefaultText>Then the pain comes, and you know at once there are worse sorrows than the Sorrow, worse ends than oblivion. 

Inifere was bred to bear the brunt of this torment; you were not. In time - if time exists at all in this place - you learn what falsehoods you believed: that agony has a limit, that despair has a bottom, that the body will break if asked to bear too much.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your voice sounds faint and distant, almost drowned by the rush of Tides around you. 

But your brother hears you. His face twists with otherwise unseen exertion, and then slowly the Tides calm and the *thing* brushing against the borders of your mind withdraws. Or perhaps it is your mind that withdraws. Whatever the case, the peril is passed. 

"And I will pay with pain again for my kin's abortive dalliance."

At last he nods and, still without looking, takes the Merecaster out of your hand, twisting and turning it without ever looking at the device. He hands it back with a shake of his head.

Your brother meets your eyes with a hard, half-dead stare. "Our minds are more dangerous than cyphers, brother. Meddle at your peril."</DefaultText>

He encompasses the hell around you in a broad gesture. "Better to die, you think? Oh, no, little brother. Life is a cardsharp. It puts you too deep in debt to quit the game, too poor to wager against its bluff."</DefaultText>

"The child screams in my dream, in his arms, bent on harm, in his hands, strong fingers clutching the brat, hoisting it up to his lips, bloody, flesh-flecked teeth.
