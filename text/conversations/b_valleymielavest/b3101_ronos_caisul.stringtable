      <DefaultText>As the Children of the Endless Gate vanish into the Valley, two dusty figures clamber out of a hidden niche. The first is a slight, nervous man in a hooded robe of blue and white. He bows. "I am Ronos Cai'sul, a Memorialist of this place. My companion is Beltrax, an explorer and knowledge seeker."

He bows to you. "We are truly grateful for your intercession with those monsters. We've have helped, gladly, but..." He shoots a look to his friend.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He is a bearded man with a wide smile, and he carries a variety of well-worn weapons on his person. A bandolier of small images and trinkets crosses his body. He claps a hand to Ronos's shoulder. "I wouldn't let him. My job is to keep him safe. I couldn't let him risk his skin, and for that you have my apologies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Those cultists - the Children of the Endless Gate - they have overrun the Valley of Dead Heroes. They slaughter the visitors. They hound us, the Memorialists, and have brought horror to every corner of this ancient place. Please - you have shown your mettle in dealing with these murderers. I beg of you - please find a way to make them move on."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, gods. Did you come to kill me, too?" It's the Memorialist that was hiding from the cultists at the entrance to the Valley. The skinny man looks nervously at the people nearby. "I have information. I can be useful."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes alight when he sees you return. "The Children of the Endless Gate have curtailed their activities, and I have no doubt it was due to your actions."

He presses a device into your hands. "Please. Take this as a token of our gratitude."

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>Suddenly, he claps his hands to his head. "Ah! I am bedeviled by visions!" He squeezes his eyes shut. "I see... I see circles in red. A great gate, yawning. My friends, slaughtered, and the Valley a charnel house. But... no. My friends are happy and well. Yet you have done something... something of great help to the valley."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He holds up his hand, and rises shakily to his feet. "Don't tell me. Don't explain." He reaches into his pouch, and pulls out a device. "This is for you. I don't know why, but I feel... compelled... to give it to you. Take it."

He says, "How very strange, this feeling. But it feels *right* as well. In any case, welcome back, friend."

      <DefaultText>Choi's thoughts jangle about in your head as you stand before this man who calls himself "Ronos Cai'sul." 

She starts with alienation and rage at this... theft of her father's self. But with the fickle speed of youth, her heart changes, thudding along until it reaches its ultimate conclusion - that this is how the world reworks itself and tries again, like a child kneading clay between her fingers and dreaming of all it can be.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>128</ID>
      <DefaultText>And with that, Choi's entire essence changes. She's no longer a corpse moldering inside you. She's not a curse hung from your mind, a grit of regret that could, in time, rasp your soul raw. 

No. 

She's the opposite now: a balm, however slight, the sense that what is broken can be repaired, what is severed, made whole.</DefaultText>
