      <DefaultText>The man looks nice enough and seems unassuming at best. But - and this is the strangest feeling - it's almost as if he doesn't exist. As you try to focus on him, a sense of dread builds in you. You're not afraid, exactly, but you know you aren't safe.

"You'll want my name... It's been long since I spoke it. Let's see... How about you call me Fenz? No, that's terrible. Hang on." He starts muttering. "Finx... Foeens? Fee... nix? Yes! that's it! Phoenix! Call me Phoenix."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He smiles. "Trouble? Not for me. They have come for me many times. They do not leave."

The fact that he stands in the middle of the valley - alone and safe - supports his story.</DefaultText>

Something about him *pulses*, an almost subsonic beat, and you stagger slightly. Anger creases his brow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have decided. My name is Phoenix." He says the name as though tasting a new wine.

He holds up his hand, and for a moment you can see light fading through it. "I am... a seeker? Is that how one would say it? Yes. I am a seeker."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It is... wisdom. Wisdom I seek." He closes his eyes and starts laughing. "All the things I've found."

His eyes snap open. "The structure of the world is not as you imagine. What you see and feel is nothing more than the varied interactions of fundamental forces that apply rules to subsequent, large pieces. Those pieces become what we call matter. What we call meat. What we call reality."

He reaches out to touch your shoulder and his hand passes through you, and you feel nothing.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>He reaches out again, and this time his touch is cold, it is fire, it is acid and star-shine... but you are undamaged.

"Enlightenment comes from within," he whispers, and he begins to cackle. "Or does it come from without?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>He steps forward and puts a hand on your shoulder. "You have come here. Perhaps you obey the call of the tombs, and give me what I need. I tell you, I need answers. Someone gave me a note. It said to come here, and I would find my answers. I would find the truth. But I can't understand this note."

His eyes burn - literally - though his face seems untouched. "What use is power if I cannot understand? What is the purpose of my power if I cannot *see*? Ask me! I do not know!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He takes the note from you, scrutinizing it intently. He shimmers and flickers momentarily, and then exerts himself to remain material through a force of visible will. 

"That... that would explain why I could not understand myself. An artificial construct in my mind. I am dead, and manifest again. Have I mastered time?"

He takes an internal inventory. "No. I am... a particular shade. A remnant, an echo of what could have been. I shall fade, then, and hope that my lesson remains."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So a self-assigned importance? What makes consciousness so special that it can determine its worth?

      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>He bows his head. "A fair counter. From what I have seen, life continues in many places, in many worlds, and consciousness has mediated itself out of existence in some species. I cannot say if it is importance." He smiles. "*I* cannot say. Perhaps *we* might."</DefaultText>

"But you are determined to *know*, and if you would risk your sanity and mine to uncover these answers, then I believe your determination."
