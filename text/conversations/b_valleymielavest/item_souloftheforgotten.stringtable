      <DefaultText>You're holding a small box in your hands. It is shaped like a casket and beautifully ornamented, with writing etched into the lid in markings that resemble no language you know of. By contrast, the casket is minimalist, even bare, on the inside. A single pastille lies within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you reach into the box to take the pastille, your hand is repelled back. It doesn't feel like it was forcefully ejected, but rather as if someone took you by the wrist and gently but decisively moved your hand away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A skillful hand etched these markings deep into the lid. The glyphs are intricate and strike you as ideogrammatic, but you can't decipher them. And yet, they seem oddly familiar, as if you've seen them before. If not in this life, then in another.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The intricate glyphs are still nonsensical, but the longer you look at them the more you have the sense you've seen them before.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A memory blossoms, but it is hard to comprehend what you're seeing. It is as if it is seen through the eyes of someone not human. Do you speak this language, or do you not? You see your fingers trace a pattern on a set of glyphs very similar to those on the casket's lid.

Almost reflexively you repeat the pattern on the lid. The casket lid opens, revealing that a small blue figure with long spindly limbs has now appeared, lying atop the pastille, opening some of his many eyes to look up at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A memory blossoms, but it is incredibly confusing, fragmented - as if seen through the eyes of someone not human. While in the memory, your fingers unconsciously trace an unfamiliar pattern on the set of glyphs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The figure clambers up to sit on the edge of the casket. Several eyes are focused on you, blinking at irregular intervals. He starts speaking in a high, wailing tone. You can't understand a word he is saying. Recognizing this fact, he picks up the pastille and reaches it up towards you.</DefaultText>

You feel the nature of their existence as if it were a tangible being. As their homes were crumbling and their children starving, their perseverance in face of all the odds defined them.

You feel the nature of their existence as if it were a tangible being. They did not despair as the end approached, secure in their vast stores of knowledge, wrapped in the belief that reason would find a way out. This casket preserving their memory was made by them.

      <DefaultText>You understand that the people memorialized by this cask were a secluded people, now long gone, eradicated by some cataclysmic event. You feel the nature of their existence as if it were a tangible being. You get a hazy sense of their accomplishments, but a nasty thick veneer lies over it. These people accomplished great things, but a petty jealousy saw them hamstring each others' accomplishments. This may well have contributed to their end.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you consume the pastille, a burning smell immediately overwhelms all of your senses. Flashes of memories try to force their way into your mind, but they are too alien to understand.

After some time your mind settles down, leaving blurry memories and hazy details, yet somehow you have gained a full cognizance of the people that this casket memorializes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The creature closes its many eyes, then wails again. Seeing you unresponsive, it crushes the pastille between its hands, blowing the powder into your face. A sweet odor overwhelms your senses, giving you a strange sense of mental restfulness, as fragments of memories flit through your mind. You get the sense this was not how the creature wanted to share this memorial, but you are given some cognizance of his people.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the cognizance ends, you find the creature gone, the casket now burning with a cold fire in your hands. In mere moments, it is nothing but ashes drifting away between your fingers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The casket's lid cracks and opens, a strange blob of a creature with spindly limbs and many eyes is now sitting in the casket, holding the pastille. It wails softly, crushing the pastille in its hands and blowing the powder into your face. A sweet odor overwhelms your senses, giving you a strange sense of mental restfulness, as fragments of memories flit through your mind. You get the sense this was not how the creature wanted to share this memorial, but you are given some cognizance of his people.</DefaultText>
