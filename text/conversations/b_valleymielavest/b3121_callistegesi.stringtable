      <DefaultText> Callistege traces the deep-set band of concentric circles with her fingertips, oblivious to the attention of her echoes.

 "Such artistry," she whispers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm not sure..." She frowns, continuing to trace the lines with her fingers as her sisters look on, each observing it from a slightly different angle. "At the center, here, there's what looks like the Ninth World. But these other images..." She falls silent.

She frowns. "Machines, nanobots, the datasphere. And if this image is correct... yes. Under the proper circumstances, I will be able to make a connection..."

She trails off again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As soon as you get a clear look at the image, everything falls into place. There, at the center, is the world, and surrounding it is a vast net of interconnected tines and towers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see the Ninth World at the center of the drawing, but the rest of the lines make no sense at all. Some are at right angles, some form loops, and some disappear entirely, only to show up elsewhere. It's a thoroughly confusing mess, and not one that it seems it will be easy to untangle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is a schematic, a structural drawing of some ancient vintage - towers, forks, circles, energy orbs, and more litter your vision. You focus on a fork more intently, and you recognize the leftmost tine as one of the many devices your sire had hidden away under Sagus Cliffs. In the image, however, it's surrounded by a series of sharp lines, one of which is bisecting an unrecognizable figure.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>By comparison, the towers are surrounded by concentric circles, in which the figures remain whole. The tips of the towers reach the third concentric ring around the world, while the tines only reach the first.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Callistege's eyes widen. She turns back to the drawing, tracing it with renewed vigor.

"Of course! These taller structures pierce the third layer, whereas these small others..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's what we saw in your sire's lab," she says slowly, turning to look at you. "If your interpretation is correct, that numenera will not help me." She falls silent for several moments.

      <DefaultText>"The question is when and where I will be *able* to make this connection. It implies a willing biological construct."

And then she perks back up. "I am one step closer to understanding the datasphere, and you have progressed one step further than your sire ever came!" She nods in a self-satisfied way. "You should be proud, dear. You have just surpassed your creator."

She releases her grip on you, and waves the image into nothingness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perhaps." She takes a step back, and then another.

"What sad, vain hopes are these that so small a realization can undo them?" she says softly, then turns and walks away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look!" Callistege brushes away the tattered remnants of a prayer flag, revealing an image engraved into the stone beneath. Names and other symbols have been carved over and around it, but none with as fine a precision or purpose as the original. Callistege traces the deep-set band of concentric circles with her fingertips, oblivious to the attention of her echoes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes alight on the eight concentric rings, and she hisses with delight.

"I would like to uncover this thing's secrets." She runs idle fingers across the strings, producing a series of discordant notes that shiver a jagged, ugly rainbow into being. She frowns.

"It must require tuning."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With Callistege's hand on your shoulder, the images snap into a clear focus. You see an intricate image, with flickering lights that seem to indicate data and measurements, projected into the air. You realize that these images and measurements project through realities, through dimensions, and you have a momentary glimpse into Callistege's everyday perspective. Probabilities coil around you, and it is only through the power of your shared mind that you can make sense of what you're seeing.</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>Even with Callistege's multidimensional aid, the images are too strong, too intense for you to look on. Something in the quality of the light *burns* your eyes. You look away, eyes watering.

"We must try again," she pleads. "I need your help! Focus!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>You try again, and struggle to see the images through the burning light, but you cannot hold your eyes on it before you tear up again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Intricate etchings cover this carved head, with the most prominent being eight concentric channels centered on the brow. A small porcelain bead in each channel is attached to loose metal strings of varying thickness. The strings run down into the bridge of the nose, and emerge from the open mouth at even intervals, reaching down to the floor.

It reminds you of a large, stringed instrument - though you have no idea how to play it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She leans in close, her hands hovering over the carvings, and her sisters surround it as well. One of them makes a decision and presses a button in her reality. All of the echoes stand back, communicating on some higher plane, and at last your version of Callistege turns to you.

""It's an instrument,"" she announces proudly. ""These carvings tune it. If we can figure out the appropriate sequence, we can unlock its secrets."""</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Each bead is made of a different metal, machined in exquisite detail. A tiny indentation in the bead fastens on to the string - a beam of coherent light. A small bridge anchors the bead to a partner in the neighboring channel. The beads are loose in their channels, so if you push on one, the other moves in tandem.

Closer examination reveals four slight declivities, in the shape of an X, in the channels. If you moved the beads into those spots, you might be able to lock the strings into place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stroke your hands across the strings, and lights appear above the instrument. A strange interplay of colors flickers, not quite in time with the tune you play, but while images *almost* resolve, none quite cohere. You develop a headache, and your mouth fills inexplicably with the taste of sand. 

You stop playing.</DefaultText>

      <ID>119</ID>
      <DefaultText>The lights flicker and shine again, disjointed images flashing like ghosts across your eyes. Pictograms, numbers, letters in unknown languages - they all race by too quickly for you to understand, and the sounds from the strings carry some information that evokes fleeting memories and emotions.

You stop again when the headache becomes too powerful to bear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I believe I know a melody or two that we might play."

She settles her fingers on the strings and concentrates. Several of her more solid echoes lean in to whisper, and she smiles and murmurs. She begins to strum.

The sound is unearthly, crystalline. It shivers through your bones. After a few halting notes, Callistege has the sense of the instrument and plays a haunting melody in a minor key.

      <DefaultText>She lifts her hands from the strings and steps away from the instrument. Nothing happens. "How disa-" she begins.

The strings harden completely, humming. Above them hovers a welter of confusing lights and images. You can't even look at it - some sort of spatial or temporal distortion blinds you.

Then Callistege places a hand on your shoulder, and for a moment you see as she does. The image slides into focus along planes of realities. "Together," she whispers, "we will solve it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes alight on the eight concentric rings, and she hisses with delight.

"I would like to uncover this thing's secrets." She runs idle fingers across the strings, producing a series of discordant notes that shiver a jagged, ugly rainbow into being. She frowns.

"It must require tuning."</DefaultText>
