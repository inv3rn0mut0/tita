      <DefaultText>You step into the glare and it envelops you, blinding you, then dissolves you into twinkling motes, drifting in a spear of light. The light carries you through cold darkness, weightless, bodiless, selfless, toward another patch of glare. Then suddenly... you are somewhere else.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The patch of light seems to follow you as you walk around it, always facing you. It doesn't look like much, just a trick of the light, but you get the strangest feeling that it's watching you. The way it moves and pulses... it feels *alive*.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a tear in space here, like the patch of darkness near the entrance to the valley. A patch of white light hangs in the air, like glare bouncing off a window - except there is no window. Within the light you see a play of shadows, like those on a wall opposite a door when someone walks past outside - except there is no wall. 

But there might be a door. 

There is certainly a breeze, coming from inside the shimmer, and echoes of sounds you are not hearing around you. If you stepped through, you might go anywhere, or maybe nowhere. It could be just a trick of the light. </DefaultText>
