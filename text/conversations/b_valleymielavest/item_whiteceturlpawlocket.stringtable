      <DefaultText>As you take the item into your hand, you see there are the smallest flecks of auburn within the whiteness of the paw. It also feels a little furry, eliciting a strange sensation as you run your thumb across it. You notice small claws which probably could be pressed and clicked further into the locket.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You've heard of relics like this. Whatever its original purpose, it serves as a capsule of some experience - usually one of great emotion. It may be that the society who created it wished to preserve its brightest moments from generation to generation.

Though it may also be merely a kind of toy, or the encapsulated experience might be an unintended side-effect of its true purpose - whatever that is.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you are about to press the claws, you get a strange feeling that you may be intruding somehow - that this relic was not meant for you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You press the claws in gently with your thumb and feel them click into place. The locket crumbles into soft, crystallized dust.

Even as it does, a vision overwhelms you.

You feel grass beneath your bare feet, soft and cool. As you look up, you notice the sun fading slowly behind some trees nearby, the evening twilight shades of soft yellows and gentle blues fading gently together.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You seem to be in a garden, a brown fence surrounding it, a variety of colorful flowers swaying as if of their own volition at its borders. Your eyes are drawn to a floatpad at the centre, within it a young man seemingly asleep, wearing plain clothes and darkened glasses.

As you look away from the floatpad, your eyes notice a blur of white at the end of the garden. As your eyes focus, the blur of white appears to split in two, and you see two sleeky animals sitting at opposite sides.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you take a few steps towards the floatpad, the man lying within stirs. He glances in your direction and lifts his dark glasses, his brown eyes looking you up and down. He has black hair and light brown skin, and for a brief moment, a sliver of dying sunlight passes over his raised hand. You notice a gold ring on his hand with an oval black stone. As the sunlight touches the stone, it highlights a golden six pointed star which seems to look in your direction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The young man slowly sits up and then then smiles softly, his expression welcoming. He tilts his head gently and then gestures towards the end of the garden. You glance in that direction to the sleek animals at the end and then when you look back, the floatpad is sitting empty, idly drifting above your head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You shut your eyes tight, feeling the soft breeze against your face. The smells of summer overwhelm you and then fade away. 

Then you open your eyes to find yourself back in the real world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a decisive jump, you manage to leap high enough to grab the edge of the floatpad, and pull yourself up. You lay down on the floatpad catching your breath and as you do so it buzzes gently and you get an overwhelming feeling of peace and relaxation. The fragrances of the summer breeze overwhelm you and as you briefly close your eyes, you feel as if your mind, body and soul are healed.

After a few moments - or perhaps an eternity - the floatpad lowers itself, powering down. You place your feet on the grass and and rise from the pad.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You attempt to leap and grab the edge of the floatpad, but succeed only in latching your fingers on some of the complex machinery on the side. It bites deeply in your flesh, the energies coursing through you invigorating but painful.

      <DefaultText>As you move towards the end of the garden, you see two animals - ceturls, they are called - sitting at opposite sides. They are both almost completely white with some small flecks of auburn. The one on the right is a little bigger than the one on the left, her fur a little fuller. She is lying on the ground, her green eyes soft and gentle. The name 'Callisto' enters your mind for a moment and then fades away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>On the left, the other ceturl stands upright, her body agile and sleek. She also looks at you, her eyes sparkling with a deep intelligence, emerald green looking you up and down. The name 'Angel' enters your mind.

They both seem to be inviting you to approach them, but your form is becoming hazy, blowing away like dust in the soft wind. You may only have time to approach one.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach the feline on the right, you are nearly overwhelmed by a deep sense of love and connection for her, echoing the relationship she must have to the other spirit tied to this item. As you sit yourself down on the grass before Callisto, she slowly stands up and moves towards you.  

There is an aura of purity around her, of deep wisdom along with a profound sense of compassion. She brings her face to your hand and a soft lick greets you, her tongue flickering gently against your skin.  A sense of warmth envelopes your hand and begins to flow around your body.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You close your eyes and feel a profound sense of happiness, of having experienced the love between this feline and the young man, the connection that they shared transcended worlds and time. The blades of grass beneath your legs fade along with the warm summer breeze, and soon you're back in the real world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach the feline on the left, you are nearly overwhelmed by a deep sense of protection and care, echoing the relationship the spirit tied to this item must have had for her. You sit down in front of Angel as she watches you, warily.

Her emerald eyes seem to tumble into a deep feline sense of intellect that cuts you to the core, but then also softly shimmers comfortably in your mind. As if in greeting, she softly knocks her head against yours, marked by a reverberating echo which seems to bring about a deep sense of clarity.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The electrical sting courses from your fingertips to your brain, and all throughout your body. Your senses go numb, and you feel yourself slipping out of consciousness as you fall towards the grass. Yet, before you land, the two sleek animals from across the garden have arrived underneath you, gently catching you in what feels like a bubble of protection, undoing the damage done and even healing you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You land on your feet, now facing the two animals - ceturls, they are called. The ceturls are both almost completely white with some small flecks of auburn. The one on the right is a little bigger than the one on the left, her fur a little fuller. She is lying on the ground, her green eyes soft and gentle.
