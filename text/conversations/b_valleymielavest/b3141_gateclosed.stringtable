      <DefaultText>Somehow, Inifere's decision to close the Gate forces you back outside. Inifere is gone - there's no telling where - but the Gate has closed behind you. Without the Gate, the cultists have no reason to kill anymore.

Or *less* reason, at least.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With Inifere's death, the Gate suddenly expels you from its bowels and closes behind you. There is nothing here for the cultists now, no reason for them to kill.

Or at least *less* reason to kill.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once again, you have changed the past of one of your siblings. The Gate is no longer here. It was *never* here, although you clearly remember it. If this is anything like what happened with Matkina, others might remember it too, at least in flits and shadows. But now it's gone, and that's something.

The blood and corpses remain, so perhaps you haven't changed reality *that* drastically. If nothing else, without the Gate, the cultists have no reason to kill.

Or *less* reason, at least.</DefaultText>
