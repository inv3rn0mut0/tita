      <DefaultText>"That's right, husk," says Callistege, laughing. "I am your doom here, there, in every reality you can see. Don't you forget it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sneers. "Fought you three times so far walking through here. Twice that redhead did for me, but I still put my knife in your neck in every stream. Whichever way it goes, you're done."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The one like me. Stopped two of my lines so far." He grins. "But she's not in this one, is she?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The two cultists break off their conversation as they notice you. The man, big, rawboned, and unsettlingly unfocused, backs away from the corpse they've been hacking up and raises his butcher knife as if he's warding off evil. 

He points past you toward Callistege. "Keep that crazy redhead away from me. We don't want anything to do with her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He laughs darkly. "Then you shouldn't have stumbled past me."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sneers. "Fought you all three times so far walking through here, and twice that redhead did for me. But I still put my knife in your neck in every stream, so think twice before starting something."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>The cultist looks down at the bag of jars. "That's all you want? Take it. Take as many as you want. Just let us go."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fine. Just go. And take her with you."

Callistege chuckles as the two cultists warily turn back to the body and continue to hack it into portable chunks. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Idiot. Now that you warned me, you've lost your advantage. Put your knife away before I hurt you with it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But if you already killed me, then I'm already dead, right? So there's no point in doing it all over again. Why waste the time?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stares at you for a moment, then looks around as if at other people or things you can't see. Finally he shrugs, sullen, and sheaths his butcher knife.

"Fine. But this valley is the tert of the Children of the Endless Gate. You pass here at our pleasure."</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>The big man blinks, then scratches his chin with the back of his butcher knife. "That makes sense... I guess."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The only way you're gonna hurt me is if I stub my toe on your skull."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You don't know nothing about the streams, do you? You gotta die in every one, so let's get started."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The two cultists break off their conversation as they notice you. The man, big, rawboned, and unsettlingly unfocused, steps over the corpse they've been hacking up and raises his butcher knife. 

"You again," he says, glaring at you. "And without that crazy redhead this time. Good, you haven't got a chance without her."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>As the cultist threatens you, you notice that the corpse at his feet has a net bag slung around his shoulder, filled with glass jars. One of those jars might be perfect for collecting flecks of shadow in.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Get away from us."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And we butcher those that displease us," says the other cultist. "So watch it!"

They turn back to the body.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>As they turn back to the body and continue to hack it up, the female cultist looks up at him. "You sure about this, Colo? They still look alive to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't particularly like your tone... or your actions. I don't think you're walking away from here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll make you eat those words," says the big man. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about. She's like me. She can see into different realities."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head in contempt. "I'm like *you*, little man? Please. Someday you might crawl from the mud and look up at the stars... and when you do, you'll see me laughing down."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you take a jar from the netting, the two cultists warily turn back to the body and continue to hack it into portable chunks, muttering all the while.

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>Distracted. Disturbed? This cultist mutters a reply to a question you did not hear. He barks a laugh to a quip that was not told. Indeed, he seems only loosely aware of anyone else's presence.

He brings a cleaver down just inches from the other's hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The air around him becomes hazy as  he smiles. "Sorry? Didn't catch that. Too much going on."</DefaultText>

      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>She allows herself a wolfish smile. "This is tiresome. Are you going to keep yapping at us, or are you going to put that blade to use?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cultist turns to her companion. "Uh... Colo? Do I survive this? It's easy for you, but me? I've only got the one life."</DefaultText>
