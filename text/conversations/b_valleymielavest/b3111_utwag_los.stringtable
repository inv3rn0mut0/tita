      <DefaultText>This short, red-haired man has vivid green eyes that emanate a mix of sadness, lost dreams, and hope. The stranger sizes you up and for a second you feel true interest in your persona, but then he looks away, lost in his thoughts. A moment later, he turns back and smiles. This smile is like his eyes, full of shards of emotions: caution, cynicism, fear, and friendliness.

His arms are tied and he looks like he's been beat up pretty badly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hello again, friend," he says. His smile is only a shadow of what it used to be. "Have you thought of a way to get us out of this mess?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This short, red-haired man is propped against the wall, bruised and beaten and with his arms tied behind his back. His vivid green eyes emanate a mix of sadness, lost dreams, and hope. He sizes you up from his position on the floor for several moments, but then he looks away, lost in his thoughts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of his companions kicks him from his reverie, gesturing to you with his head. The red-haired man looks up at you again, and smiles. This smile is like his eyes, full of shards of emotions: caution, cynicism, fear, and friendliness.

"Hello, friend," he says.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Utwag's face is pale, making his shock of red hair seem even brighter. He's staring at Jenkins, who is slumped against the wall, unmoving.

"They killed him," Utwag says, his gaze transfixed on Jenkins' face. "They stabbed him and he didn't make a sound and then he was dead." A shudder runs through him and he starts pulling uselessly at his bonds.

"We have to get out of here," he mutters, on the verge of panic.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>Utwag is still staring at Jenkins' body and doesn't seem to notice your approach.</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Utwag." He has difficulty dragging his eyes to your face. "Utwag Los. I came here with Jenkins and Narve. We're from Jerboa. Were." His gaze falls back to the nearby corpse.

"We were from Jerboa," he says quietly.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks up at you slowly. "Utwag Los," he says, the small quaver in his voice making it sound more like a question.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>He straightens, though it's clear the effort pains him. "I'm an explorer and do-gooder - self-proclaimed." For some reason, he smirks at the stout man next to him when he says this.

"I've been all over the world, had every occupation and hardship you could imagine. Why, I even had my luck stolen from me! And do you know what I learned in all of that?" He leans forward. "You can do anything if you work for it. *Anything.*"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We came across the Wastes. I thought it would be a good shortcut, get us ahead of any others who were on the same trail." His voice is distant, his gaze still fixed on the nearby corpse. "I thought we could handle anything. And Jenkins, he said..."

He trails off and looks up at you, his eyes filled with pain and fear. "Help us. Please."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We crossed the Wastes and came here looking for shelter. We found *them* instead." He spits the word, turning it into a curse.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>He leans forward conspiratorially. "Let me tell you," he says.

"We left the Oasis some weeks ago, tracking a tale of deceit and fabled numenera. We were hired to find something called a World String, a tiny contraption that can spin a web so fine it's all but invisible, but so strong it can slice the world in two if someone had the means and the mind for it. No idea if it actually exists, but that's how this all started."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We were searching for something called the World String when we literally stumbled into this valley. Our own quest has been put on hold while we help these fine people."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>For a moment, you wonder if he heard you. Then he speaks.

"There's Narve the Blessed, and Talira, who we only met here." He closes his eyes, giving himself a respite from the dead man beside him. "And Jenkins. The most aggressively helpful idiot the Beyond has ever seen." Tears leak out from behind his closed eyelids, and he bends forward to wipe them away on his knee.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We've still got Narve and Talira. Jenkins..." He looks up at you, pain and confusion overwhelming him.

"We don't know the passcode. Tell them! Even if we wanted to, we can't give up information we don't have!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>He tilts his head toward the ratlike man near him. "That's Narve the Blessed. Meanest bastard this world has seen, 'cept that he keeps messing it up somehow."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Jenkins the Jinxed and Narve the Blessed. Finest explorers you'll ever meet."</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You too, friend."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, there we were, out in the Verxulian Wastes when we happened across a broken hound the size of a griffalo! Something had irritated it, so we decided to seek shelter and wait for nightfall, to see if it might not range a little further from the route we wanted to take. I was looking for just such a place when something slammed into me and knocked me down into this valley."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Narve and Jenkins followed, of course, and we ran into these fine Memorialists in a bit of trouble. Now I'm never one to turn down a challenge or people in need - it's almost a curse, you might say. So of course we agree to help them lock their Necropolis. After that... well, you can see what happened after that."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thanks for your help, friend. We might've made it, but I'm glad we didn't have to take the chance."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thanks for getting us out of that mess. And about Jenkins... Listen, don't blame yourself."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks over at one of the bodies on the floor, unmoving.

"They killed him," he says, his gaze transfixed on the corpse's face. "They stabbed him and he didn't make a sound and then he was dead." A shudder runs through him.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm Utwag, by the way. Utwag Los, and leader of these sad sacks. Wish we could meet under better circumstances."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Our other companion was Jenkins the Jinxed." He sighs deeply. He doesn't appear to have any more to say on the subject.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>He gestures with his head to the earnest-looking man with a smile. "And that's Jenkins the Jinxed. Always around to help, especially when you don't need it."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm afraid I don't. Talira there didn't tell us." He leans closer. "Just between you and me, I'm *glad* we don't know it. One of us would've given it up for sure, by now."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"*That's* the brush you're painting me with? Bah." He scowls and turns away.</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, friend, sorry. But if she's dead, you should ask the Memorialists. Supposedly, they know all the dead."</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm surprised you bothered to free us. I'm guessing you hope we still have *some* use for you. Am I right?" He shakes his head with pity. "Friend, a man like you only finds barriers at every turn - all self-imposed."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>"I'm surprised you bothered to free us. I'm guessing you hope we still have *some* use for you. Am I right?" He shakes his head with pity. "Friend, a woman like you only finds barriers at every turn - all self-imposed."</FemaleText>
