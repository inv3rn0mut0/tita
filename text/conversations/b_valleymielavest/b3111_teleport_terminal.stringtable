      <DefaultText>A shimmering field obscures this pedestal. It seems to be emanating from a small device *within* the field. That must be the whisperlock.

Also inside is a configuration of buttons surrounding a central dial, but with the whisperlock engaged, there is no way to reach them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No!" Narve yells, but the sound is cut short by Isalu's blade. Talira scrabbles back against the wall as the other woman moves silently toward her.

"Help!" she calls to you. "Help me!" Isalu jabs her in the chest with her knife, an efficient punching motion that's accompanied by a distant cracking of bone. Talira slumps sideways and lands face down on the bloodied floor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good work," Motley says, shaking you slightly. He steps forward and taps a sequence into the pedestal as Isalu and Jaelyn line the bodies up at the other side of the room. The stone of the wall sloughs away, revealing a slightly fuzzy image of a dimly-lit room beyond. 

The two women start carrying the bodies through, and before long only you and Motley remain.</DefaultText>

Motley nods. One of the cultists draws his blade, but instead of cutting the prisoner's bonds he puts it to the woman's neck. He intends to kill her!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cultist draws his blade across her throat. A dark line appears on her neck. She opens her mouth as if to gasp, but no sound escapes her lips. Her body trembles, blood staining the front of her robes.

Finally, the light in her eyes dims and is gone. She falls to the ground with a wet *thwack*.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cultist draws his blade across the first prisoner's throat. A dark line appears on his neck. He opens his mouth as if to gasp, but no sound escapes his lips. His body trembles, blood staining the front of his clothes. Finally, the light in his eyes dims and is gone. He falls to the ground with a wet *thwack*.

The cultist does the same to the next prisoner in line until they're all dead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stumbles backward, his grip on the blade loosening. "You..." He glances at your tattoo, his face paling even further. "Yes, my lord. It will be as you say."

He hurries out of the corridor. A piece of paper flutters out of his pocket as he goes, but he doesn't notice it in his haste to leave.

The paper lands at your feet. You pick it up as his footsteps recede into the valley.
