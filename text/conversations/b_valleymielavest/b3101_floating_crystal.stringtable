      <DefaultText>A huge crystal floats in front of you, seemingly unaffected by the wind that washes through the Valley. Within, red and blue patterns lazily cycle and twist.

The crystal hums softly, almost invitingly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The swirling colors of the crystal have changed. The crystal is now a flat, motionless black.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crystal swirls madly, and your mind is pulled back into memory - but not your own. This is a stranger's life.

A life of torment. A lifelong torment. From his first conscious moment, he has been surrounded by monsters, a sacrifice to the unseen. A hair's thickness from consensus reality, horrors crawl and gibber, and he must howl with them or be devoured.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When at last he can open a door to the world of sanity, to escape this endless pain, he does... and he steps through into an abattoir. Robed and hooded cultists devour the dead, and they revere him for the journey he's undertaken.

In their adulation, they strive to follow his path, wallowing in their own shame and agony, an endless burlesque of horror they hope will end in transcendence. He flees from them, from a darker menace inside him, but they follow, inescapably. His "children."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crystal will do nothing on subsequent touches, though the player may be able to review the visions he already saw. The colors of the crystal will not change later, even if the PC's Tides change. It is an imprint of who he was when he bonded with it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you try to lift your hand from the crystal, it *burns*, imprinting itself into your skin, and new shades - all in the colors of the Tides you know - begin to wash through it, slowly solidifying as the crystal aligns itself with your Tides.

And then it begins to plunder your memories.

      <DefaultText>The visions replay again, as they did last time, the scenes of abuse and horror burning themselves into your mind. The name "Choi" rings loudly, and again you are ejected into the conscious world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It has been infused with Tidal energy: its colors are emblematic, and you can feel the tendrils of force that coil from it, stretching toward some distant, unknown destination.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No matter where he hides, they linger on the other side of the door, awaiting a new revelation, making bloody offerings of themselves.

Then, one brings a different sort of offering. A dripping charnel sack that spills out a girl. "Choi," the man calls her. Still alive, just long enough to look at him with pleading eyes before she's gutted. "For you," the man says.

He flees - into a hellscape, into madness - but they follow him everywhere, grinning, bloody, adoring. "Children."</DefaultText>

The crystal will also bond to the PC, taking on the colors of his dominant Tides and copying some of his memories (can possibly have some reactivity here, where the specific memories he notices are of minor choices the player has made to this point). Doing this will earn DP.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crystal has changed: its glow is gone, as is the lively dancing of the colors within. Its slow-churning heart is a deep black.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Through Inifere's eyes, you watch as he staggers across the broken land beyond the Valley of Dead Heroes. Already he is being trailed by the Children, scavrows that will never be shaken.

His feet hurt - he's become soft from hiding behind the Gate. There are gashes on his calves from where he slipped against shale. His breath is short, and his head is spinning.

But with a glance at the Children behind him, he presses on.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vision is the same: the broken, wounded man, crossing a broken, wounded land. Here in the crystal, as perhaps in the world, it is a march that has no end.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You cannot know what passes through his mind: this is no Mere. Whether it is stubbornness that drives him, or fear, or hope, or an effort to draw his bloodthirsty pack away from the Valley.

Perhaps it is all of these things. But what is inside the man lies hidden, just as the end of his journey is hidden, perhaps even to him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your mind wakes in darkness. Aching cold sets in to a... familiar body. The cold is distant and the howling around you even more so.

This is your memory, through your own eyes. But you're detached now, and no longer a confused newborn. You're seeing it how it *really* happened, stripped of terror and curiosity and impatience. And stripped of agency, too - you're nothing but an observer.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>You see your birth, again: the fall, the confusion and terror, the strange presences hovering over and inside you.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>As you gaze into the crystal, you suddenly feel something reaching back towards you. No, not *something* - it's *nothing* that's reaching out to you, an absence that demands a presence, an emptiness that must be filled.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>Again, the crystal seems to be pulling at your mind, like a vacuum that must be filled.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>You feel yourself wiggle your fingers, toes, and hips. You observe your own panic: panic at falling, panic at forgetting, panic at life itself and life's fragility. Of course, not as fragile as it first seemed.

You hear and watch as the cocoon protecting you shears away. Far from fear, sheer exhilaration grips you as you see the magnificence of the world from so far above. You know how this ends. Not comfortably, but not so badly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pull back.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>You recoil from the crystal, and the tugging sensation quickly fades.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>The pressure grows and grows, like your mind is swelling inside your brain, like it desperately needs some valve, some crack, to escape. The pressure becomes pain; the pain, agony.

You fall back, clutching your skull.

*Something* must give. Something must be given, and taken. At last the crystal breaks through, trepanning the barrier holding in your vastening mind. A piece escapes, and the pressure and agony cease.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>Then, there's something else. You aren't the only observer here. There's something else. *Another* presence. Part of the memory itself. Not curious like you. Furious. Furious at being cheated, and desperate to have this body.

It doesn't feel quite like the Sorrow, but then, the Sorrow is a mutable and inscrutable thing. Whatever it is, you know it to be no friend.</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>Alas, unlike in a dream, you hit the ground before you wake up. And then the memory ends.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>Then the crystal swirls before you again, and the memory fades. But something clings behind, like rancid grease.

The horror of what was done to the girl Choi hangs on you, your memory now as much as it was the man's. And his own suffering lingers too. 

The cultists who beset him seem little different from those who now haunt and harrow the Valley. Perhaps by unraveling this crystal's tangled skein, you will learn some of their secrets.</DefaultText>
