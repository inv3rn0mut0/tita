      <DefaultText>This man's face is flushed and angry. Veins throb on his forehead, and his eyes are focused on his companion.

"Stop. Talking. Raima." He spits each word, gripping his weapon belt with bloodless fingers. "Stop talking, or I'll prove you wrong right now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's simple, brother. The Endless Battle is a test, and Andronus's side has been failing it for centuries. Our creator managed to annoy the First enough that she stormed off in a huff... he even did it in Andronus's body. You'd think that this big oaf, of all people, would understand what our sire was thinking."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I just don't understand her," he says, flinging his hand in Raima's direction. "The Changing God abandoned us at birth, then fed us lie after lie when he chose to speak with us at all. She claims he has a master plan. I see a man who serves himself, first and always. He doesn't care if we die. Even *I* care more if Raima dies than our sire does."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head, laughing. "The fact of the matter is our father created this sanctuary *for* us to protect us from the Sorrow. But hiding isn't a strategy. Eventually, we'll have to take the battle to *it*."

The gleam in her eyes is a banked fire. "And when that time comes, our father wants an army who will follow his orders without question. He *allowed* the First to spread her doubts, and the traitors among us have flocked to her side." She tosses Andronus a scornful look.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He barks a bitter laugh. "Did you know that he sparked the whole war from *my* body? He got the First angry at me, then ditched this shell, leaving me to deal with the consequences. Good thing the First knows the difference between the face and the mind." He rubs his eyes.

"But Raima... look, I know how she feels. The Sorrow is hunting all of us. It's *nice* to think that the Changing God has a plan to protect us. It's just not true. *I* know."

He glares at Raima, then looks back at you.</DefaultText>
