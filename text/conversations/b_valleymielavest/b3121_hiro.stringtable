      <DefaultText>All you can tell about this man is that he is clothed in red robes, with a pipe in one hand and a staff in the other. Is he a weary traveler? A seeker of relics? Perhaps the pipe and staff are heirlooms from his ancestry.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One thing is not in question - the look of disgust on his face.  "You're an explorer. Let me guess. Tantalum sent you down here too, didn't he? He tell you to come find Hiro? Well, you found me."

He scowls. "Tantalum. That drig, that sodden laak-nibber, that scabrous tulk. I'll bet he does this to everyone, sends them off on a wild chase with promises of deep and secret knowledge, and then laughs about it to himself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You know what, I'm going to go find him right now." He strides away, realizes that you have spoken to him, and stops. He turns. "My apologies. You're not to blame. Farewell yourself."

      <DefaultText>"Creft. Skist. In other words, precisely nothing." He holds a finger up. "That's not precisely true. I found this worthless piece of junk in a tomb, doubtless dropped there by some *other* sap duped into Tantalum's errand. Worthless. Can't even break it down for shins."

He tosses it to you. "Here. A reminder not to listen to buffoons."

      <DefaultText>"Unfortunately," he huffs. "I *was* looking for ways to tie together a theory about certain gravity-bending civilizations, but Tantalum diverted me by saying I'd find my answers if I read enough tombs. So yes. I know him. That bastard."</DefaultText>
