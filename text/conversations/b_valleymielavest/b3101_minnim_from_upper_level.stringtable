      <DefaultText>You step into the glare and it envelops you, blinding you, then dissolves you into twinkling motes, drifting in a spear of light. The light carries you through cold darkness, weightless, bodiless, selfless, toward another patch of glare. Then suddenly... you are somewhere else.

      <DefaultText>The light seems shaped, yet formless, and it does not alter its appearance as you walk around its perimeter. You feel the stirrings of a strange consciousness within the light, something unfathomably alien yet... friendly - or at least, not hostile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A patch of white light hangs before you, like glare bouncing off a window - except there is no window. Within the light you see a play of shadows, like those on a wall opposite a door when someone walks past outside - except there is no wall. 

But there might be a door. 

There is certainly a breeze, coming from inside the shimmer, and echoes of sounds you are not hearing around you. If you stepped through, you might go anywhere, or maybe nowhere. It could be just a trick of the light. </DefaultText>
