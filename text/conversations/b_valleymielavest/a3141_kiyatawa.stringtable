      <DefaultText>On the surface, Kiyatawa looks exactly the same as when you first saw her in the Dendra O'Hur Chapel while you were investigating the murder of Fulsome's protégé in the Underbelly. 

But some things have definitely changed. A feverish, blotchy glow colors her skin, and her grin is entirely at your expense. 

"Ah, it's the investigator," she says. "Good to see you again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I thought I had you fooled," she says. "The lost little girl surrounded by inhuman cannibals."

She shakes her head. "We managed to underestimate each other, didn't we?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tell me - did Mallet beg for his life when you accused him of the crimes I committed? Did he blubber when Fulsome pulled the noose around his neck?"

She slyly tongues a sharpened tooth. "Oh, I hope so."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>An odd expression crosses her narrow face. Desperation, maybe. Or fear.

"I suppose not," she says, smiling again. "All of that is behind us now."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Why should I?" she snaps. "Was life in the Underbelly so wonderful? What did I steal from them that was worth keeping?"

She is nearly shouting now. "My whole life, I've had a voice in my head, whispering, shouting that I was someone else. Making sacrifices to the Endless Gate *shut her up*. Why should I suffer? Why should *my* life be a misery so other people can live?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I remember you," she says, cocking her head. "You're the investigator Fulsome hired when I killed his protégé." She smiles. "The one who asked all those questions."

She shakes her head. "It must sting a little, knowing that you let me get away. That all those people died."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tell me - was Gh'zei afraid when you accused her of the crimes I committed? Did she weep when Fulsome pulled the noose around her neck... or did she laugh?"

She slyly tongues a sharpened tooth. "She seems - seemed - like the laughing type."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Only the parts that I thought would incriminate me," she says with a careless shrug. "But don't get flustered. I couldn't fool you. You *deserved* to catch me."

She grins again. "But you didn't."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Huh," she says, shaking her head in wonder. "Someone saw me in the seconds after I ate the corpse that changed me, and you managed to find them. You *deserved* to catch me."

She grins again. "But you didn't."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You were spotted in the marketplace. That's what gave you away."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe not," she says with a careless shrug. "But I still got away, didn't I?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>She stares past you for a moment, the smile slipping from her face.

"I've been wondering," she says at last. "What would have happened if I told you the truth? If I'd confessed the moment we met?"

Her eyes return to yours. "What would you have done?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I would have killed you on the spot."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Really," she says, snorting. "I wonder if you could have."

But she isn't smiling anymore. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Help?" she says. "So, you're one of those. Let me ease your conscience." She smirks. 

"The damage was done years ago. By the time I joined the Dendra O'Hur, I had killed three people who were trying to kill me. I had a voice screaming in my head that my existence was *wrong*. The Endless Gate saved me. It gave me peace. Purpose."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah," she says, relaxing. "And faced Fulsome's brand of justice. I should have known."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't regret killing those people in the Underbelly," she says, raking her fingers through her hair. "Their deaths brought me here. They brought me *peace*."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't regret killing Fulsome's boy," she says, raking her fingers through her hair. "His death brought me here. It brought me *peace*."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You think it's funny that an innocent person suffered for what you did?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I think it's funny that you'd consider any of the Dendra O'Hur 'innocent'," she says. "They're *all* killers."

She toys with a strand of her hair. "No, I don't regret lying to you. I'm glad Fulsome's people didn't come after me until it was too late."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, I'm not," she agrees. "But the Dendra O'Hur suffered for what I did, and that's enough."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I remember you," she says, cocking her head. "You're the investigator Fulsome hired when I killed his protégé." She smiles. "I wondered when you were going to find me... I was *worried.*"

She shakes her head. "It must sting a little, knowing that you let me get away. That all those people died."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, you are," she agrees. "But far from Sagus Cliffs and the bodies I left behind. You're too late, investigator. The damage is already done."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Really?" she says, toying with a strand of her hair. "Me either."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No. It doesn't bother me at all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And so, you bought peace with Crooked Qeek's life."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe you will," she says, shrugging. "Maybe whatever's beyond this life is worth dying for."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That," she says, faltering. "That was an accident. She saw me talking with Wheedle and I thought..."

She sighs, tangling her fingers in her hair. "Who cares what I thought. Dead is dead, and she's gone now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What," she says, barking a laugh, glancing at the man beside her. "You think I've found a place of honor here? They don't trust me. None of them do."
