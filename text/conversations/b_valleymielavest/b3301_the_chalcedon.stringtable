      <DefaultText>This man is less flesh than muscle, running in corded bands from his thick neck down his broad chest, wide arms, and callused hands. He focuses on you, his cold eyes flicking from your face and the shape of your tattoo to the width of your shoulders, like a prospective buyer sizing up a particularly dangerous animal.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am the Chalcedon, commander of the Changing God's forces in the Endless Battle, the guardian of his grand design, and his champion." He raises a self-deprecating hand. "Not that our sire truly needs my help, of course. But some here - in the very land he created for us - would rather acknowledge all he's done for us."

He shakes his head slowly. "Some of these disagreements can be resolved through debate. But not all, of course. Not all."</DefaultText>

"The most advanced of our sire's children, here at last. I'm surprised you didn't make your way here sooner."</DefaultText>

And when he has done so, he gives them to us, gives us *life*, so that we might continue using them in service of his plans. He is like a sculptor, honing his art."

He raises a finger. "So you see, he's not flitting from body to body like some manner of vapid insect. Each castoff is an improvement over the last."

He lays a hand on your shoulder. </DefaultText>

He barks a laugh. "The First Castoff wasn't content. She spread lies about our sire and turned some of his children against him." He presses his lips together.

"We're not ready," he says. "Paj Rekken and her followers have squandered the time we could have used to prepare for this moment." Then, he lays bracing hands on your shoulders. "But have no fear. We'll think of something. We are our sire's children, after all."

      <DefaultText>"No, but that's not unusual," he says. "His strategies absorb most of his time, which is why he leaves most of the work in the Endless Battle - and the diplomacy in Miel Avest - to me." He flashes a grin. "And as you might imagine, he measures time differently than us."

He chuckles. "It's been a number of years since I've seen him. I doubt our sire has noticed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She's dead now, but the damage is long done. Our family is divided. The First's army would see us destroy the Changing God and seek 'freedom' from his plans for us." He growls under his breath.
