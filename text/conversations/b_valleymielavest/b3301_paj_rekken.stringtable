      <DefaultText>This woman is dressed in functional glaive's clothing, her hair is cut short, and her face is muscular and tense. You recognize her instantly from Tash's Mere: Paj Rekken.

She spares you but a moment's appraising glance before turning to your companion. "Matkina. You've come crawling back. Didn't you swear you'd never return here, or had you forgotten?"</DefaultText>

She chews on the inside of her cheek before she speaks. "Must admit I'm surprised you made it in. You realize by breaking open the portal lock, you've made our sanctuary more vulnerable to the Sorrow? But you probably don't care about the results of your actions, do you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I did promise. Then I remembered that none of you have ever bothered keeping your vows to me, so what's the point?"

"Anyway. What've you been up? Burning a few villages full of innocent civilians? Or have you graduated to grander atrocities?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just trying to keep our creator - the Coward - from committing any more of his war crimes, as usual. Looking at the larger picture, instead of serving my own self-interest. Maybe someday you'll learn how to do that, though considering your friend here just muscled his way through the locked portal - making our sanctuary even more vulnerable to the Sorrow - I don't think it's likely." 

She turns to you. "You know you're traveling with a traitor, right?"</DefaultText>

She adjusts her swordbelt. "Kholn was a pity. A tragedy. But it had to happen that way. I've been a warrior for most of my centuries. I know about making sacrifices in service of a higher ideal. I've stopped losing sleep over them. Live long enough, and you'll understand."</DefaultText>

The First found out and took a stand to stop him. But she's dead now, we're stuck with me commanding in her memory... and meanwhile, sycophants and lickspittles work for him for the privilege of being destroyed. For some incomprehensible reason, they've put their *faith* in the man who dropped us into a world of pain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What would you know about friends, *infant*? How long have you walked the earth? A few days? A few weeks? You have no idea about sacrifice. But you will." 

She leans in close. "Someday, you *will.*"

Then she draws herself erect, in full military bearing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He's quiet for a moment, and then he bursts out. "You're looking for the Changing God? The Coward?" He jerks a thumb at you. "Right here. At least, he was telling everyone in Sagus Cliffs he was."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks at him coolly for a moment, and then at you. "Is that so. Then you'll be happy to know that we've got some surprises in store. I'd put a knife in you right now if I didn't think you'd leave me holding the body of a blameless castoff."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks back to Aligern. "Problem with that slippery bastard who created us is that you've got to *prepare* to catch him. Right now, I've got nothing."

She turns back to you. "So ask your questions. I don't particularly care who you are. *I* pride myself on my honesty. Unlike some."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, how very *useful* of you. Next time I want someone informed that I have a message for them but cannot send it, I know just who I'll come to."

      <DefaultText>"There are rumors that Sorrow activity has increased recently. I don't buy the stories, but many of them do." She points a thumb behind her to the other castoffs.

      <DefaultText>"Word of advice, then. Undo it. I've seen other people try to make themselves more than human - like the Coward, for instance - and all it gains you is a lifetime of loneliness and centuries of regret. Never seen it work out for anyone."

She shrugs. "But you people will do what you must." She turns back to you.</DefaultText>
