      <DefaultText>As soon as you open your mouth, a slick, black cloud surges out, emptying your lungs of air almost completely. It's the black flecks from the dying minnim, but... they changed, somehow, inside your body.

The cloud floats toward the minnim. Where it touches, the minnim becomes more diffuse - less a clot and more a cloud - expanding, unfurling, until its dark center is revealed, and within that center, a pulsing red light and a welcoming warmth that carries with it the echoes of sounds you are not hearing around you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You release your hold on the pulsing life inside you. Darkness wells up out of you, through your chest, your throat, and flooding out of your mouth. It chokes and burns, leeching energy and alertness from you as if feeding the newborn thing with your own vitality.

After what seems an eternity, the pain subsides, followed by an overwhelming feeling of relief.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The floating darkness before you looks a little like the tears in space elsewhere in the valley, but this one is different. It is furled tight like a black, unblossomed rose. There is no depth to it. It looks less like an open portal than a closed door.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The feeling of desperation that touched you when you examined the dying minnim has returned, even stronger now, as if it was reaching through you in an attempt touch its lost mate, begging you to connect them. 

You also sense, however, that doing so will hurt you, taking from you the clarity of mind that bonding with the dying minnim had given you earlier. You will be uniting two long parted beings, but you will suffer for it. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The floating darkness has awakened. Where once it was clotted and closed, now within its darkness you see a flickering red, like the reflection of a fire, and a comforting warmth comes from with, carrying with it the echoes of sounds you are not hearing around you.

      <DefaultText>The effect on the darkness is miraculous.

      <DefaultText>The pulse in your chest - the bond from the dying minnim below - becomes stronger in the presence of this one. The feeling of desperation is almost unbearable. It wants - *needs* - you to connect them.

You also sense, however, that doing so will hurt you, taking from you the clarity of mind that bonding with the dying minnim had given you earlier. You will give life to the pair, but not without cost.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You have a sudden gag reflex. Something lurches in your chest. Something inside your body is reacting to the minnim, trying to get out.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yet the black sludge continues to spew from your lungs. You are unable to control it, retching out more and more, until finally, when it feels as though you're going to pass out, the last of slips past your tongue. You feel weaker, but at least it's out of your body now.</DefaultText>
