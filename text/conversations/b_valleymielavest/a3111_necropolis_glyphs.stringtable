      <DefaultText>Behind the tattered prayer flags of a long-dead civilization reveals a series of six-sided symbols carved into the rock of the wall. Some are merely outlines, while others have concentric  shapes inside them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This section of wall is covered with symbols from floor to ceiling. Peering upward, you can faintly make out more symbols stretching above you, and sweeping away millennia of dust from the crook of the wall reveals that the etching continues under your feet.

There's something about the placement of the symbols on the wall that hints at a pattern as yet undiscovered.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The symbols that cover this section of wall are placed in shallow, independent divots, like the weight of their carving has borne them deeper into the rock. The cumulative effect is that of a large, faceted jewel, awaiting only the correct quality of light to shine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Within the small area you've cleared, there is one symbol that is repeated. It consists of a hexagonal outline with another partial hexagon inside it - at the center is a tiny dot that, on very close inspection, proves to be another immaculately-rendered hexagon. No other symbols are repeated within this segment of the wall.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>You spot the repeated symbol again - the partial hexagon inside a larger hexagon, with its tiny hexagonal middle dot - but don't find any other repeated symbols, or even matching pairs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stone is smooth and cool against your fingertips. The symbols are etched so expertly that it's impossible to tell whether you're tracing an outline or an empty expanse of rock by touch alone. The incisions are deep but unnaturally precise, a fact which has doubtless contributed to their longevity.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>You trail your fingers across the symbols again, but find no raised edges or chisel marks, no texture of any kind that would indicate how the lines were etched so deeply into the rock.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>You spend some time peering closely at each of the symbols in turn, trying to discern their meaning in relation to each other. However, it's only when you step back, your eyes slightly unfocused, that the pattern becomes clear.

The symbols are arranged in multiples of six, with each cluster forming a point in another set of six. The visual effect is oddly disorienting, an outward spiral of ever-increasing magnitude that soon encompasses not only the Necropolis but the universe itself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This expanse of wall has been rippled by time or heat. In sections where the wall is smooth it's impossible to tell by touch alone where each symbols starts and ends. In the place where the rock has been tempered, however, the edges of some of the symbols just barely protrude from the wall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Careful of the warped symbols in the rippled expanse of the wall, you trace your fingers over the symbols once again, but find no further insights.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The carving in these places is sharp enough that you inadvertently open a razor-thin incision in your index finger without even realizing. When you draw your hand away from the wall, bright blood blooms just beneath the surface of your skin, staining your fingertip red.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You focus on the repeated symbol, certain that it must hold some importance. After some minutes of concentration, it finally strikes you. The placement of the repetitions is consistent with modal particles in several early Ninth World languages. Whether these come at the beginning, middle, or end of any sentences - or if, indeed, the race that lived here had any conception of sentences - is impossible to determine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The placement of the repetitions is consistent with definite articles in the Truth. Whether they come at the beginning, middle, or end of any sentences - or if, indeed, the race that lived here  had any conception of sentences - is impossible to determine. Nevertheless, you've made the first small step toward comprehension that could, perhaps one day, lead to a full translation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You lose yourself for a moment in the overwhelming symmetry of all that is and ever was. Eventually some survival instinct triggers deep within your subconscious, bringing you back to your body with a physical jolt.

The wall before you hasn't changed, but it now exudes a malignant sense of something entirely *other*, a knowledge and method of thinking that can only be described as completely alien. Whatever built these halls knew nothing of humanity. Perhaps it's just as well.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You try to focus on the symbols again, to re-experience the vertigo that took you beyond the edges of all human thought.

      <DefaultText>Each symbol is hexagonal in nature, with a varying number of lines inscribed within. Each line is parallel to those around it and none of the lines intersect, yet there is a variance to their construction that hints at a finite number of permutations. They could be numbers, words, or even ideas. Whatever they are, they were worth preserving for countless millennia longer than anyone - or anything - that could read them could possibly have lived.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once again you're struck by the absolute intent of these alien markings, that someone - or something - would wish them to endure far beyond whatever civilization created them. Their ultimate meaning, however, continues to elude you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Placing your hand on one of the symbols causes it to emit a soft, ambient glow. The moment you remove your hand, however, the glow disappears. You repeat the exercise with several of the symbols, all to the same effect, none the wiser as to what's going on behind the rock on the chamber wall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a lightning-fast flicker of your fingers, you touch each of six symbols quickly in turn. Just before the glow of the first symbol fades, you strike the sixth. For a moment, nothing happens.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You move your hands quickly across the wall, but the first symbol repeatedly goes dark before the sixth has begun to shine. You try placing various parts of your body against the stone in different places, but are unable to tell whether you have six effective points of contact or not. Eventually, you're forced to admit defeat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, a grating, shrieking cacophony fills the room, echoing in the enclosed space until it's nigh unbearable. A space behind the rock wall begins to brighten, the stone turning slowly translucent to reveal a dazzling, glowing core within.

      <DefaultText>Then, just as abruptly, the sound and light stops. The symbols fade and the wall returns to normal, hiding once more the glowing device and whatever mysteries it may have contained.

      <DefaultText>It's incredibly difficult to hit six symbols while trying to avoid the most common. You take a deep breath and, operating more on instinct than conscious thought, manage to touch the sixth symbol with a fingertip before the first goes dark.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As before, the stone in front of you slowly turns translucent as the alien cacophony deafens you. This time, however, the glowing core within the wall resolves into a woven sphere of light, anchored to the floor by reddish-purple vines. The globe wavers between its anchor points in a lazy approximation of a circle, tracing a six-patterened spiral in the air.

      <DefaultText>You understand suddenly that the sealed off chamber was meant to be the same as the configuration before you. The transparent stone bears similarities to the material sealing the door, its opacity waxing and waning in concert with the light of the sphere.

Unfortunately, the room's purpose, and whether it was created by the same alien intelligence as the symbols, is unclear. When you take a step back, the stone resolidifies and the noise stops, leaving you standing in resonating silence.

      <DefaultText>The vines cluster more closely underneath the sphere, not impeding its movement but growing as close to its influence as they can. You understand they're drawing nourishment from the light, though they lack any of the characteristics of any plants you've ever seen. 

The purpose of the combination of light source and vine remains unclear, and whether this is a natural or unnatural occurrence likewise remains a  mystery.
