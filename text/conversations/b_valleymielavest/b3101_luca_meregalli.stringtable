      <DefaultText>The man is busy reading a strange device, an elegant square of some kind of metal. Odd letters and images flash by on a reflective screen embedded in the square. 

When you draw near, you notice that the device is plugged into his arm with a long silver wire, and one of the man's eyes is mechanical. 

"Greetings." His voice is kind, though it buzzes like a rattling sheet of synthsteel. "I am Luca Meregalli."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gestures with the book. "Sometimes I read in the older tongue. I uncover great knowledge this way. For instance..."

His metal eye stutters and clicks, and a tinny voice emerges from the pad. "The formal education of the young begins in utero, with nervous system uptake inhibitors and microwave transmissions to the developing fetal brain."

He clicks it off. "You see? I do not know the species to which this refers, but I begin to know *of* them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did I not introduce myself?" He closes his eyes. "I did. I said 'Greetings. I am Luca Meregalli.' Perhaps your memory storage has been corrupted." He seems concerned.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh dear. Your memory issue seems to have worsened." He speaks slowly. "I am Luca Meregalli."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He leans close. "I admit to concern for my friends. They seem trapped in the past. Paralyzed. They are not as they were when we set out." He gestures to the mechanical extrusions on his own body. "Nor, to be fair, am I."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They were full of hope once. We - and a dozen others - set out from our home, an aldeia west of Sagus Cliffs, to find fortune in the Endless Battle. We joined a recruiter in Sagus Cliffs, and enlisted with the army of the Changing God. We thought we were prepared. We were not."

"We were in trenches. We fought with bolt-throwers, energy weapons, and detonations. That first day saw half our friends obliterated by a rogue particle wave that emanated from our side of the battlefield. "</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And then we woke again in a new reality, our memories of the old world intact but our bodies whole - except for Timpo, who was half-dissolved in this new reality. So it went - incremental gains as a whole, with certain consequences carrying into new lives. Sometimes they would undo all our day's heroism for an unseen advantage. Other times we'd lose a friend forever."

"One day I was caught half-out of a trench. The air exploded above us, and I burned. The new reality did not restore me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I spent some weeks under the care of chiurgeons. When I awoke, I was as you saw me, and our other friends had been killed. Thalana and Denovan reacted very differently to me. They say I too have changed. I don't know. I know that I no longer fear. I do not remember much of *emotion*. I recall the fear and horror, but I do not recall its *taste*. And when I spoke to them, they agreed that it was time for us to leave. To leave before we became these forgotten names, lost in the flux of worlds."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>He frowns. "Yes. We have left our posts. But I do not believe we have deserted. I believe we have become aware. If the battle is endless, then our struggle means nothing. If our struggle means nothing, why should we continue to struggle?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You could just as well be talking about life. If life has no meaning, why continue to struggle?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because the struggle reveals who you really are."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You struggle for something greater than yourself. An ideal, perhaps."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"For the safety of your friends, perhaps."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps the struggle is not for life itself, but to find life's meaning. Or perhaps it is a biological imperative. Chemistry and instinct are powerful motivation." His metal shoulder shrugs. "It doesn't matter, though."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We discussed that. We decided that continuing to struggle would reveal us as fools. And so we chose a path we thought wiser."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>He considers your words for a time. "Had our commanders presented an ideal for us to follow, this might have been true. But we fought for money and for glory. We found no great measure of either."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That was indeed our motivation to join. The knowledge that those are empty pursuits motivated us to leave." He considers his companions. "Perhaps they left because they felt broken inside. The loss of our friends has affected them greatly."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was our mutual safety that caused us to leave. We saw no pressing need to place ourselves in the way of harm when we might protect ourselves better elsewhere."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It is a dry place. I tasted the water that bubbled up nearby. It was alkaline and induced strange visions. My new metabolism protected me from the worst of it. Had my friends tasted it, they might have died." He looks down at his metal pad. "We have found no bodies, nor anything of value. All is quiet. But this is a waypoint, not a destination."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"I would not remain here long. It is inimical to life."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods. "I have spoken my name already. The knowledge of my character is thus more important. I was a soldier. I travel with my friends. I and my friends travel to our home. Or at least, this is our plan."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>He frowns. "I am unwilling to commit personal details to a stranger. I have told you what I am willing to share. No more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of a certainty," she murmurs, stepping close to examine the man. They speak in low voices to each other as she runs her hands across his prostheses. At last she smiles, thanks him for his time, and backs away.

"Fascinating," she says. "His realities have been smashed together, and it is not merely his mechanical brain that makes him distant and emotionless. It is the juxtaposition of multiple words. His singular humanity is... broken. Speak to him yourself, and judge his affect yourself."</DefaultText>
