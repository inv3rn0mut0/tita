      <DefaultText>You immediately recognize this bespectacled man from Caravanserai in Sagus Cliffs. His name was... Omahdon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>And that means that the purple-haired woman is Perseia - the woman you helped him to find. She turns to you, fury in her eyes.

"You. Hello. Would you please tell him to leave me alone?" she says through her teeth. "He won't listen to me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And a good thing I did!" Omahdon says. "This is no place for you, my love. Not any more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And thank you, dear friend," he says. "She will come to her senses. I know she will."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My friend, you misunderstand," Omahdon says. "This is precisely the condition I described to you before - she looks upon me, the love of her life - and sees an enemy." He tries to lay a calming hand against her cheek and she swats it away. His expression hardens. 

"Thank you for reuniting us, my friend," he says, and there is naked malice in his smile now.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Perseia turns a withering look on you. 

"Oh, thank you *so* much," she spits. "Just go. Go before you help me any further."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This woman studies the Necropolis, ignoring you utterly. Something about her seems familiar, even though you're fairly certain you've never seen her before. Something to do with... Caravanserai?

You shake your head. She's not someone your predecessor knew. Perhaps you only heard about her or saw her in passing.

She feels your gaze and turns, eyebrows arched.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>You recognize this woman from the description that Omahdon gave you in Sagus Cliffs. This is Perseia, Omahdon's 'lost love'. She certainly doesn't appear as confused as Omahdon made her sound. Instead, she's studying the Necropolis with a frustrated expression. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You what?" she says, whirling around. Her eyes are wide, pale circles. "And you're certain he hasn't followed you anyway?"

She studies your face, and relaxes. "Thank you. You have no idea how much you've helped me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Trying to get into the Necropolis," she says. "Those damnable cultists won't let anyone near, though."

      <DefaultText>"No," she says, after studying your face a moment. "I apologize, but I'm not in the mood for company."

She returns her gaze to the Necropolis.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She turns back to the Necropolis. 

"Damnable cultists," she mutters. "I need to get back inside, but I can't risk... "

She catches your eye. "Never mind. None of this is your concern. You've done more than enough."</DefaultText>
