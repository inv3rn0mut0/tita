      <DefaultText>A golden glow surrounds her as she steps forward, a kaleidoscope of beautiful colors - the shifting energies of the Tides cast into tangible being. She holds her hand aloft, and ethereal fires play around it.

The weight of the Sorrow's baleful focus settles on her. Your vision shrinks to a pinpoint as the two face each other.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She listens to your words, and she nods, her face a mask of tragic beauty. "If I can save even one other, I will consider my life a success. I have lived long enough. It is time to see if I have the strength of my convictions."</DefaultText>
