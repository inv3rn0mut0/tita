      <DefaultText>"Ah, Choi. Choi in joyful repose, a chin in thought, a foot full of toes! Though the toes are mostly missing, snatched away by wind, like the light in her eyes!" He hums a snatch of a popular song and immediately mangles it. 

"What was it? Ah yes. It was... no." He hums the tune again and mangles it in a different way. "Yes, yes, that's it! 4-2-2-1."</DefaultText>

He catches himself, and taps sternly on the floor. "You should know this name. You should know this code. 2-4-1-3." He starts to titter again. "Cai'sul!"</DefaultText>

He drums an arrhythmic pattern into the dust of the tomb's floor. After a moment, he scatters his assembled junk with a swipe of one hand. The pieces fly randomly, but each lands during one of the beats... and they land in a straight line.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A frail humanoid creature with olive skin, clad in rags wrapped around its waist, rummages about aimlessly, fidgeting with elongated hands. Scattered and frizzy dark strands on its scalp appear to be hair. As you approach, he rears his head, revealing large yellow eyes with tiny black dots that stare back at you gleefully. His smile, wide for a creature of his size, shows a perfect set of teeth as his head moves inquisitively from side to side.

      <DefaultText>"So strange to think of a mind as a place to store thoughts. Only by custom, only by memory. Much better to find a place for your thoughts in the world." He pauses and thinks. "Of course, then you have to worry about someone stealing your thoughts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You... you... you!" He sputters, and then realizes that he's getting dangerously close to you. He yelps, grabs a handful of his junk, and disappears from the room. You're not quite sure how he left.

He didn't take everything, though. You find an oddly shaped item amongst what's left.
