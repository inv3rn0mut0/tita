      <DefaultText>This middle-aged woman sits stoically, her hands bounds in front of her legs. The sleeves of her robe have fallen from her wrists, and you catch sight of yellow and purple bruising above the lacerations from her tightly-cinched bonds. Streams of tears have carved channels down her dust-covered face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks up at you, her eyes the color of the seas around Sagus. Two more tears slip silently down her cheeks. She turns away from you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have been here for many years. My companions and I," she refuses the impulse to look at the corpses that surround her, blinking slowly instead, "came here to find ourselves and, through them, paradise. I met my wife from the age when we were both alive, and together we worked to bring the rest of the world to understanding." She bows her head, whispering a name under her breath.

"She will not be forgotten," she says forcefully.</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>She considers you anew, as if determining your worth. "My people are the Memorialists, those who have discovered that this world is already filled with the dead. Though we walk and talk, we do not live. Such is the paradox we face."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The only escape we have is to remember who we were. We have been placed here as a test, to see if we, as a people, are deserving of the good that is our birthright. Together, we must rediscover our graves and the true names we held in life. If all could do this, paradise awaits."</DefaultText>

      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But should all forget..." She stares beyond you, at a future only she can see. "The world will be cut off from paradise forever. The circle of rebirth will continue, without purpose or end. This dismal non-life will be all we ever know."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>For a moment, her tears stop. She looks at you and for the first time it seems that she really sees *you*.

"Not many," she says. "Not enough."</DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I had been planning to enter the cycle of rebirth, to meet my wife in our next incarnations. But how much better to free her from the cycle by bringing paradise to be." She takes a shaky breath. "Yes. That is how I must proceed. And you will help me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The key word is 'Guni.' I would rather that these Children have no access to their twisted Gate, but if that is the price of continuing our work, then it simply must be paid." Her hands are bound together, but nevertheless she takes one of your hands in hers, grasping it awkwardly. "Thank you for showing me the way."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I could kill you and eat your flesh to discover your secret. I'm choosing to ask you instead."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>83</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Children of the Endless Gate. Motley, Jaelyn, and Isalu." She bares her teeth on the last name. "Murderers, all of them. But she enjoys it more than most. More than anyone should." Her snarl fades.

"Surely your next question will be why I am a prisoner." She watches your expression. "Certainly, he will have told you a version of events. For the sake of posterity, I ask that you hear mine."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>84</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Children of the Endless Gate. Mad women and men bent on turning the world inside out to match the twisted image in their own minds."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Children kill because they believe that to be imprisoned in flesh is to suffer. When alone, they punish themselves. When in packs..." She inclines her head toward the bodies that surround her.

"Some join the cult because they have suffered. Others join because they enjoy suffering. And others still join because they want to inflict their own pain on others. Isalu is one of the latter."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>She locks her eyes onto yours.

"Do not trust them. Regardless of whether you do decide to trust me or anyone else here, know that they speak only lies disguised as truths. Such is their way. And now my wife is dead."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>88</ID>
      <DefaultText>She quickly bows her head, but you catch the glint of a savage smile. "Good. Return to me afterward and I will give you the key."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You catch a flicker of disappointment and despair before she can conceal it.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>She stares up at you, the flow of her tears increasing until she pitches forward, burying her face in her hands and sobbing wildly. Her words are slurred and shaken by her jagged breaths.

"They were going to... kill  them. *I*... killed them..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sits at your feet and cries like a lost child, the strength ebbing out of her body. Gradually, her breathing slows and it sounds as if she might have fallen asleep. Then she sits up and stares through you, her face scoured of the dirt and the grime by the evidence of her anguish.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The key word is 'Guni'. Now end this, for all our sakes." She looks up at you, a terrifying finality lurking just behind her unnerving calm. "One way or another."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kill her and eat her flesh.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>102</ID>
      <DefaultText>She makes no sound as your blade slides between her ribs. Her eyes meet yours, but all that is present is a searing indifference. Slowly, she topples sideways onto the bloodstained floor.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>103</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her flesh is lean, yet flavorful, her blood flowing over and around your tongue with the comforting warmth of memory. Years pass in the blink of an eye, layered around a core of heartbreak and devotion. You wend your way to the most recent memories and unearth a single word: "Guni."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She stares up at you, then she shakes her head, tears flying in all directions. "You don't understand the costs. How many will die if I *give* them the tombs?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>Finally, she looks up at you and speaks, her voice hoarse as though she has been shouting for days. "You are one of them. I will not speak to you nor give you the passcode."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>110</ID>

      <DefaultText>She laughs softly. "Would that I knew! The Necropolis is a vast underground complex - so vast that generations of Memorialists have yet to explore it all. The terminal, and those like it in the tombs themselves, will take you where you want to go through its magic. All you must do is press the correct key sequence. The ancient Memorialists carved numbers into the terminal so that we could more easily record and return to any location we desired."</DefaultText>
