      <DefaultText>You step into the darkness and it envelops you, then dissolves you into twinkling motes, drifting in a spear of light. The light carries you through a black void, weightless, bodiless, selfless, toward another patch of starry sky. Then suddenly... you are somewhere else.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cool air that sighs through it seems to follow you. The shadow does not change, no matter your perspective. 

You have the discomfiting feeling that your attention on it has drawn its attention to you... that it is somehow examining, analyzing, and assessing you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a tear in space here, like the sliver of light on the plateau in the middle of the valley. Here, a sliver of darkness hangs before you, like the entrance of a cave - except there is no cave. Within the darkness you see the glow of stars, and a cool night breeze wafts past you, carrying the scent of desert flowers and the echoes of sounds you are not hearing around you. 

If you stepped through that darkness, you might go anywhere, or maybe nowhere. It could be nothing but a shadow. </DefaultText>
