      <DefaultText>The carvings here display two figures standing side by side on a crag overlooking a plateau with a wide disc at its center. The scene is familiar...

A wave of dizziness envelops you, and you steady yourself against the rough stone. This does *not* help. The memory flows out through the stone in rumbling pulses, overtaking your senses. 

Yes. This scene is familiar because you experienced it first-hand when you rebuilt your mind in the Labyrinth. And now, here, the full memory awaits you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You raise your mental defenses against the onrush of images, of sharp sensations and buried sentimentality. And just in time. The memory pours past you, cold as melting snow. But yet...

Snatches. Snatches of that long, long-ago day reach you. The repairing of faulty constructs. The setting sun. And the sharp memory of the First Castoff kneeling before a tomb and laying her hands and forehead against it. 

The portal opens then, answering the glow of the tattoo beneath her mask.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memory of that long day pours past you, cold as melting snow. You direct the First Castoff's gaze towards the resource-rich plateau where Miel Avest will one day stand. You ignore the laughter in her eyes when your own constructs turn on you, and make the necessary repairs. And then, the rush of time slows as she makes her way up a moss-hung path towards you, her eyes bright behind the mask. 

"I have something to show you," she says. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You follow her to a deactivated portal.

"I've got it working," she says. "The doorway exists in two places at once - here, and on the other side. Once you align them..."

She lays her hands and forehead against the stone, as though worshipping the thing. Your lip curls involuntarily, but you can't fault the results - the portal activates, answering the welling glow of the First Castoff's tattoo beneath her mask. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The flood of memory slows to a trickle, leaving you back in your body. 

You look over at the mural. Could that be the way to open the portal?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though the two figures are faded, you can still make out a few necessary details with the help of the memory you saw in the Labyrinth. 

This frieze depicts the Changing God and the First Castoff overlooking the site of Miel Avest. They are side by side - not master and servant, but equals. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looking closer at their faces, you notice something interesting. The First Castoff is shown wearing a mask, as you remember. The Changing God's face is chipped in places, as though someone tried to damage the frieze but failed. </DefaultText>
