      <DefaultText>It's surprisingly warm. Your fingers sink a little way into the material before you pull back, leaving a matte imprint of your hand in the shining wall. Underneath the gloss, you can see that what looked like a coherent whole is actually formed of finger-wide fibers frayed and wrapped around each other in incomprehensible and wildly organic patterns.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Immediately after you remove your hand, the wall shakes again, erasing your presence.

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, the wall shakes like a dormant creature stirring in its sleep. Fine dust cascades down its surface in rivulets like rain until your handprint is gone, and the wall is as it was.

      <DefaultText>Using your fingernail, you delicately scratch at the surface of the material. Tiny specks, like scales, slough off, falling to the ground in a glittering stream. You catch some in your hand, but the moment they make contact with your skin they sublimate, wisping away in minuscule arcs of ammonia-scented vapor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You try various receptacles for the glimmering flakes, but none of them are conducive to the scales remaining whole.</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>You strike the transparent mass as hard as you can. The shock of connecting with an immovable object travels up your arm, tingling in your shoulder for several minutes afterward. The wall is undamaged, save for a few scuff marks that slowly fade.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You slide the tip of a dagger expertly between the translucent material and the stone that supports it. Using the weapon as a lever, you pry the two apart until you're able to see clearly into the room beyond.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>You find what looks like a suitable entry point and slide the tip of a dagger into a gap between the translucent material and the stone behind it. For an instant, you glimpse twisted red vines and murky sunlight, then the hilt of the dagger slips from your hand and the weapon falls to the floor, barely missing your foot.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>You choose another spot and apply the dagger as a lever, with a similar amount of success to your prior attempt. You do get a lot better at keeping your feet well away from where the dagger might fall, however.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>You insert the dagger again, and again it falls to the floor. Your actions now have become almost routine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A breath of air escapes, smelling of swamp gas and anise. Inside, the room is partially lit by sand-diffused sunlight which outlines a tumble of fallen rocks in the center of the floor. Around the edges, lining the walls and anywhere with a modicum of shade, is a thick reddish-purple vine that climbs crazily across the stone; several sections of vine are freestanding in the gloom of the open floor, proving themselves to be more sturdy than might otherwise be assumed.</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>You recognise the vines as the same ones holding the sphere of light behind the glyphed wall. They seem dormant, perhaps waiting for an attachment destroyed or dislodged by the collapse of the roof. Pulsing red tips protrude from the ends of the freestanding stalks, glistening in the muted light.</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>What is readily apparent is that the vines have grown in such a way as to avoid all contact with sunlight. Pulsing red tips protrude from the ends of the freestanding stalks, though what purpose they serve is unclear.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>The vines have grown to avoid the sun, yet those behind the wall were nourished by the light of the sphere. Perhaps that same light would have hardened the translucent seal into stone, though how this could occur is beyond your expertise. 

Unfortunately, the room's purpose, and whether it was created by the same alien intelligence that carved their symbols on the Necropolis walls, is unclear. And, due to the vast gulf of time separating the worlds, it looks as if it will remain that way.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This doorway is sealed by an unidentifiable translucent material. The way light ripples and bounces within it gives the impression that whatever it's made of is soft and slightly sticky. Shadows and light on the other side form indeterminate shapes.</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>The translucent material rapidly grows back over the gap you've created. It also hardens, making it impossible to pry it open again.</DefaultText>
