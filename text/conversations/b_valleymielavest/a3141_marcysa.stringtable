      <DefaultText>It's Marcysa. She should be long dead, and indeed there's no spark of life in her eyes, no vital energy in her motions. 

She's uglier, even, than Inifere saw her, robbed of the feverish devotion that once fueled her woe-worn flesh. The sharp angles of her bones jab through ragged robes, a display that is almost obscene despite the sexlessness of her body.

She stands beside a tombstone. It should be hers, but it bears Inifere's name now. She strokes it absentmindedly, emotionlessly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She cradles her emaciated frame, and does not look up from Inifere's tomb as you approach. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>And then it hits you. With Inifere gone, Marcysa is now the leader of the Children of the Endless Gate.

"He never understood," she says, as if on cue. She doesn't look at you, but seems aware of the weight of your presence. "Not even at the end." She scratches at the curve of her neck, leaving long, deep, red furrows in her flesh, as though she is made of bloody dough. 

"But I didn't understand him either. I knew he was suffering, but I had no idea."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tiny crimson fibers ooze from the wounds on her neck, flicking blindly at the air. They twine, merge, and melt, until the gouges are filled with fresh, wet red flesh.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She give a raw laugh. "I am as healthy as I will ever be." Her brow furrows at your question, however. Polite concern must be an unusual event in her life. With an effort, she tears her bleary gaze from the tomb and focuses on you.

"You aren't one of my Children, are you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods absently at your words and the courtesy in them, and reaches for Inifere's tomb. Her hand spasms along the way, contorting into painful, bone-breaking angles. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She blinks once at your confession. Twice. Her eyes change color and shape as she does so, from pale blue circles to the slitted green of a putrefying wound.  

Then, she nods absently, as though the presence of an outsider doesn't concern her. Perhaps it truly doesn't. She reaches for Inifere's tomb, and her hand spasms along the way, contorting into painful, bone-breaking angles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He taught me the secrets of the Gate," she says, touching her lips. "When he died, I wanted to give our Children hope of the world beyond the Gate. I never thought to wonder why he tried so hard to keep it closed."

A vast, pebbled shadow drifts beneath her skin like a diseased cloud. "To answer your question, I will never sicken or die. They deny their playthings those luxuries. And when I try to follow Inifere into oblivion, they bring me back. And they punish me. Obedience is easier."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She doesn't reply at first. Her mouth works soundlessly.

"I could not save him, and he could not save me. We were bound to each other by barbed chains. Together we were drowning." She shakes her head. "But he drowned first, and slipped away. And now I am adrift without ballast or compass."

She grins mirthlessly. "I miss the illusions he conjured in me. I miss the purpose to my suffering. I miss my ignorance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Marcysa's eyes focus, and a certain lucidity stirs in them. "Of course he did," she answers. As she speaks, she brings her hand to her mouth, almost involuntarily, and runs her tongue across her lips.

You know that Inifere never told her how to open the Gate - you were in his mind. But, as Inifere himself knew, the flesh itself can teach, to one with the appetite to learn.

Whether Marcysa consciously remembers partaking of the Dendra ritual or not, it is clear she will not admit to it.</DefaultText>

You know she's wrong - Inifere never told her how to open the Gate, you were in his mind. But she seems unwilling or unable to say more. Whatever way she gained the knowledge of the Gate will remain her secret.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No," she whispers. "The Sorrow killed him. It... what it did..." She trails off. "It destroyed him, body and soul."

She seems to gather herself, and snaps, "How dare you accuse me? How could you know? How could you know *anything*?" She turns away and leans her head against Inifere's tombstone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Marcysa shows neither surprise nor curiosity as you claim knowledge of centuries-old events. "Life and pain followed. I survived. Other Children did as well. I gathered the pieces of Inifere's body, and we set out for this place to raise a proper monument to his memory."

She scrapes at her cheek. "I thought it was important to me. It was certainly important to *them.* My masters. Whispering from Beyond the Gate. So we came here. It was a... hard journey. And it hardened us, too."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head, hunches her shoulders. "I opened the Gate in his name. We evangelized in his name, with knives. We made his mark upon the world in blood. It seemed true."

"Pain," she says again. "Pain, and life. They are inextricable."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>Marcysa shakes her head. "There have been ample sorrows, but that creature never returned. Inifere was what it wanted. It cares nothing for the Gate or its Children."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She smiles sadly while peeling back a thumbnail. "No. The Gate is not a lie. It is the truth. An awful, unforgettable truth." She flicks the bloody nail onto the floor; dozens of others lie scattered by her feet.

"But there will be no end to it. Is it not the Endless Gate? We are bound to it. We need it. Blood will spill, ours, others, and pain will shine across the planes, and vast minds will make meaning of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, her eyes shade green and a sneer curls her lips. "And what could you possibly know of that day, stranger?" She shakes her head and turns away.
