      <DefaultText>Stunted and piebald with a large, hairless head, this humanoid reminds you of a court jester - except that his wide violet eyes sparkle with cunning and intelligence, giving the impression there is much going on inside his large dome. "Who are you? You can't be here! Why did you come?"

Several people sit bound and beaten along the far wall, surrounded by corpses. At second glance, some of those bound may themselves be dead, as well.

The man steps closer, lowering his voice to a growl. "Well? Answer me."</DefaultText>

"Ah. It's not what you think." His mouth widens in an ugly smile. "We were just defending ourselves, trying to reclaim what small part of this world Fate has seen fit to cede us. It never would have come to this if we'd only had someone to help us explain..."</DefaultText>

Several corpses are strewn across the floor and against the far wall.

      <DefaultText>Wordlessly, he scrambles to his feet and flees the chamber. A piece of paper flutters out of his pocket as he goes, but he doesn't notice it in his haste to leave.

The paper lands at your feet. You pick it up as his footsteps recede in the valley.

      <DefaultText>His head jerks as if he's been slapped. He rears back onto his heels and snaps his fingers at the two women behind him.

Without a word, one of them draws one of her daggers and plunges it into the other's chest. With barely more than a sigh, the woman collapses to the floor, enshrined in a rapidly growing pool of her own blood.

"I hope we have pleased you, my Lord."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah! Well, since you so graciously helped us - or at least did not hinder us in releasing our prisoners - I'm certain Lord Inifere would *love* to meet you."

Without the code, we cannot enter the tombs and join our Lord Inifere in worship. She's rather narrow-sighted, and doesn't see the value in what we do. If we regain our access to the Gate, we can show her firsthand." He smiles. The effect is not reassuring.</DefaultText>
