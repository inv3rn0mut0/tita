      <DefaultText>An old, battered-looking swordsman in dull gray armor stands here, whistling tunelessly. His hands hover near the hilt of his well-used sword. Scars wreathe his face, and what you took for a helmet reveals itself to be a dome of metal grafted to him.

He smiles as you approach. "How do, stranger. I'm Tantalum."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My sword, for instance." He slaps the hilt, and you see that he wears no belt to anchor the blade. His knives are likewise anchored directly to his flesh. "If I want the sword, I need but think on it, and it's in my hands. Likewise for the knives. And then - and this is the part I like - when I've buried 'em in an enemy, the blades are stuck there 'til I say it's time for 'em to go."</DefaultText>

He scratches. "Anyway. I needed to remember myself. It's said that the Necropolis can give anyone what they seek - knowledge, riches, fame - if you search hard enough. And I searched. And I *found*. Now I'm here to help others find their answers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You... did? You really did?" Suddenly, he bursts out laughing. The echoes of his laughter make the dome atop his head ring and shiver in harmony. "You're stubborn, my friend. Most people give up by this point, worn down by the sheer monotony of the task. I almost feel bad for sending you down there!"

He pauses, tapping his chin. "I should probably have considered what I'd say to you, but I honestly didn't think you'd make it this far. Maybe I should just give you the truth."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Truth is, I was just playing a game. I do it with everyone who comes to the Valley looking for secrets or deeper truth. They say, 'O Tantalum, tell me what you've uncovered here!' But there's no deep secrets to be found. Just memories of  the dead. The big secret? The Memorialists are carked, and death is inevitable. And maybe you shouldn't trust just anyone who says he can help you find what you seek."

He smiles, a little sadly. "Not much of a secret, likely, but it's what I know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stops smiling. "Not a joke. A message. Life's short. It can be cut short any time, anywhere." He raps his domed head. "I know more than most how close death is."

"Way I see it, I teach people how to embrace their lives. You want to spend that time with pointless grubbing in the past, you do that. You want to spend that time doing pointless make-work for an old fool, fine. But make it a conscious choice. Maybe you learned something today. If not from the tombs, then from me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Whatever it was you were supposed to be doing. Meaningless makework isn't it. Follow your passion, follow your purpose. Do *something* worthwhile. Digging in the past isn't it. Find the future."

      <DefaultText>He stiffens. "It's not lazing around. You'd have done that work for anyone, is my point. So what I was doing was... waiting for... I was trying to..."

"Fine. All right, fine. I could have chosen a better way to get that message across than taking advantage of people willing to work hard."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "Only if you don't like secrets and knowledge."

      <DefaultText>"Then you're wiser than most who come through here, friend." He laughs. "I've been sending people on that journey for ages, and they come back here looking for their reward. They leave wiser for the experience."

He gestures at his blade. "Sometimes they get angry, and they become a little wiser that way."

He shrugs. "I'm trying to make them understand they should be doing something worthwhile with their lives. Glad you've got that covered already."</DefaultText>

      <ID>82</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "But it's so much fun! To watch people start off with their heads full of big ideas about the riches they're going to make? The power they'll uncover? So few of them actually follow through on it. You're right. I shouldn't have rewarded their work - your work - with a smug lecture. But still." He laughs some more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nudges one of the corpses with his foot. "They've tried a couple times. Once they even came to my tent at night and tried to cut my throat with my own blades. Idiots. My knives are made of tantalum and stuck to my flesh, and the cultists woke me. If they'd used the tools they'd brought - like normal murderers would - instead of being impressed by mine, I'd be dead now.

      <DefaultText>He sighs. "If you didn't question what you were doing, and if you believed what some random carker tells you to be true, maybe the problem's not with me. Maybe you should examine your own actions and choices. I didn't *make* you do a damned thing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good thing this metal is bonded to respond only to me. If someone else could control it, why, I don't know what I'd do." He clamps his hands over the dome protecting his brain. "Honestly, I'd be running away holding this on. Can always find more swords, but I've only got one brain. Least, as far as I can tell."

His smile is a little harder. "Some folks *have* tried to take this stuff from me, to make it work for themselves. That didn't go well for them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Compelled? No, no. I merely suggested that if he wanted to return to his human form, he should seek the tombs for knowledge." 

He raises an eyebrow. "You *do* know he's trapped in that body, yes? Chances are good that if he searches enough of them, he'll find what he needs. And I told him that, in the strongest possible terms."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He peers closely into your eyes. "I believe you. You did it, didn't you?"

Suddenly, he bursts out laughing, the dome on his head rings and shivers in harmony. "You're stubborn, my friend. Most people give up before that point, worn down by the sheer monotony of the task."

He pauses. "I should probably have prepared some speech about wasting your time, but people just... give up before ever searching that many. Maybe I should just give you the truth."</DefaultText>
