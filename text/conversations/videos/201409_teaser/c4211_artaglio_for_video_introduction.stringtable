      <DefaultText>[8A8A8A]The features of this once-handsome man are sunken and splotchy, the face of anxiety and drink, evidenced by the flagon in his hand. Any cheer that might have lived in his rosy face has fled, replaced with frequent, nervous glances over his shoulder. Following his gaze, you see a Maw some distance away. He looks you over, his eyes lingering on your castoff tattoo.

He takes a slow, deliberate drink.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Come looking for soldiers, have you? You've found us. Want a kingdom overthrown, a tomb robbed, a caravan guarded? I'd tell you that if you had the shins, you'd have your mercenaries... but then I'd be lying, and I *hate* to lie. We gave up the mercenary business after we deserted the Endless Battle." He looks at the nearby troops. "We want no part of your castoffs' wars."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Lore: Civilization] He grimaces, his face showing his age as he does. "It was a tattered old rag, to be sure. But the troops were attached to it. Must come from marching under its flutters and seeing so many of their friends dying under it. Does strange things to a person's mind." He drinks again. His gaze shifts nervously to the maw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some thieving murdens stole in here the other night, raiding us for food, weapons, and shins. They didn't get away with much, but they managed to swipe our standard. I think it was a personal insult."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This? This is Astarian rum, one of the finest and deadliest concoctions I've found in my travels across this land. It's like being smothered in a blanket of soft fur and drowned in love. It can strip the gloss off just about any material you care to name, too." He takes a hefty swig. "And it's not for the weak. Want some?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Success] It burns on the way down. He wasn't kidding about its harsh qualities, but failed to mention the acrid sting it puts in your nose. Tears spring to your eyes, but you manage to swallow it all.

Artaglio beams broadly. "Have another?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It doesn't go down any easier than the first. In fact, it's a little tougher. But you manage to choke it down, and though your stomach rebels, you're able to keep it under control.

"Most people can't drink one mug, let alone two. Even these brave soldiers - " he gestures to the crowd around him, irony inflecting his voice, " - even these mighty warriors find it hard going. But you? I challenge you to match me, and I'll match you. Put that vaunted castoff constitution to the test."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Critical Success] You remain unaffected by the alcohol, but Artaglio is slumping further and further toward the ground. He drops the last couple of feet in an instant, knocking over his cup. His troops hoot and holler, and they cheer your success.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gathers himself at last, pulling himself from the ground, and says, "Castoff, you are better than any other of your kind I've ever met. From this day forth, we are mug brothers. Mug brothers! You get one favor from me - ask quick, before I forget."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He bursts out laughing. "You are truly the soul of wit." He takes another hearty gulp of rum, and his brow furrows. "You're also dead right."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shouts to his cohort. "My dear fellows! Your leader wishes you to know that he is not, in fact, a mewling craven! It's time to show the Bloom what *Artaglio* is made of!"

His troops stare at him, aghast. They clearly don't want to disagree with their condottiere, but they also recognize that this is pure foolishness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The conversations around the Slump die down. Artaglio's soldiers look at you, at each other, at their commander, and at the standard that Artaglio takes from you. He unfurls it reverently, momentarily taking his eyes from the Maw. The standard is stained from the murdens' trash heap, bloody, and torn, but he holds it as if it were an infant.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stiffens noticeably, and the good cheer drains from his face. His eyes sharpen, no sign of drink in them now, and he studies you carefully to see if you jest with him. He looks around at the soldiers, who have fallen silent, and he sighs.

He stands. "My soldiers! Watch now: this is how to face your fears."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Because it'll get someone killed?
