      <DefaultText>His face brightens, and he pulls a handful of scribbled papers from a pocket and shoves them into your hands. "Scriptures! Scriptures of the Great Devourer to inspire your thoughts and guide your words." Another tortured smile cuts across his face. "From the pen of Inkpot, who is me."

      <DefaultText>Inkpot looks up from his scribbling, his crooked mouth shaping itself into the mockery of a smile. "We await your intercession with Ioxu... but our god is in pain, so we will not wait forever."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Praise the Devourer!" He embraces you, eyes wild and feverish. The other cultists caper about, bending and twisting in exultation.

Releasing you suddenly, he rummages in a pocket and drops a handful of shins into your hand, along with a small device. "Payment from the Extremities, in the manner of the outside world. But the greater reward is the favor you have earned from our god."

      <DefaultText>Inkpot is writing furiously on a scrap of paper. He glances up, eyes shining even more feverishly than before. "The *measurer* Ioxu is dead! I gathered many of my brothers and sisters together and we *assailed* his house. That monstrous automaton couldn't kill us all, not before we slew its master." 

He spits a wad of phlegm onto the back of the paper, sticks it to his robe, and immediately begins scribbling another. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This man is tall and gawkily thin. His wiry hair looks like an explosion of metal springs atop his head. He regards you with bright, feverish eyes that seem too large for their sockets and smiles.

Even as he motions you closer, the man is scribbling words on a scrap of paper. He has fastened some sort of harness around his body - it holds a tiny writing tablet and inkwell so he can continue to write as he moves about. Dozens of scrawl-covered notes are stuck to his leathery robes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ioxu desires to understand the Bloom, to quantify its impulses. This causes *pain* to our god." His eyes bulge even wider, and it occurs to you that you haven't once seen him blink. "The evidence is clear for all to see, in the raw and swollen flesh of Ioxu's house."

"We have warned Ioxu to stop his pokings and proddings and *measurings*, but he will not listen. What methods are left to us?" He lets the question hang in the air, an unspoken threat. "Perhaps you can help him to change his mind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I will not speak of *beliefs*," he frowns, "but I will tell you what is *true*. First, that the Bloom is a god - the only true god - and all that takes place within its body is solid and real. That which exists outside the Bloom is an illusion, a cruel trick, a falsehood."

"Second," he intones, "that our goal is to become one with the Bloom, to transform ourselves into living embodiments of its will... and one day, to be called to its Heart."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mood among the cultists is dark. They glare at the red and enflamed dwelling.

      <DefaultText>"Better than safe. Those fluids are the holy secretions of the Great Devourer. To drink them is to put your mind in communion with the Bloom."

      <DefaultText>"No, I would never! The Devourer will surely break through his defenses on its own." He licks his lips, glancing at his followers out of the corners of his eyes. "Perhaps you're right. Give it time, sweet time, for Ioxu's defenses to crumble. Then the Bloom will dissolve him bit by bit - a more satisfying end than brute violence, yes."

He nods, his decision made. "We will watch and wait, and I shall record his end in scripture when it comes."</DefaultText>
