      <DefaultText>This varjellen looks much like others of its kind - violet-red skin, yellow eyes, a tall crest atop its head. This one appears to have chosen a male form for now. It - he - wears thin lenses over his eyes and some strange device encircles his head, with weighted attachments dangling at the ends of long straps. His calloused, pointed fingertips are stained, and his garments are unkempt and in disarray.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Doubts rise within." His left eye goggles at you momentarily. "Extraordinary claims demand proof." He steps to the door and peers outside.

When he turns back, he constructs a wide smile for your benefit; it looks strange on his varjellen face. "Departures and homecomings have come to their forces, it seems. Hopes throng and ask for elucidation. Will they return? Evidence would suggest otherwise. My gratitude."</DefaultText>

He waits for a moment, closes the door, and turns back to you. "They had regarded this home and Ioxu, but their clamor ended. Tight smiles color their faces, but no longer do they hurl imprecations. My gratitude, I believe, is in order."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The experiments conducted within this chamber are perhaps unlikely to gain the favor of the Bloom - indeed, the great beast has evinced some displeasure.

The Bloom is a creature unlike any other, yet who has taken the time to study its nature? The first is Ioxu. The work done here will illuminate the Bloom for those who follow."

      <DefaultText>"The Bloom detests those who seek to understand it on a rational level. For some time now it has sought my destruction, to erase all accomplished here. The device generates a multi-spectrum field that repels the Bloom's advances." Ioxu's lip curls. "But this means only that it waits for me without.

      <DefaultText>His eyes bulge, and his flat voice gains a tiny bit of modulation. "The scalpel? Where did you find this? This was among the first devices I created to test the Bloom, a transdimensional blade that could cut its flesh cleanly and preserve its properties for study. Yet a thief removed it from my care, an abykos that entered my dwelling and absconded."</DefaultText>

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A power source for the blade is lacking. Transdimensionality is required. No more such sources are to hand here, but perhaps the crashed catena in Little Nihliesh might contain such a source.

    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks at it with a critical eye. "The technology is old, however. Improvements are possible beyond this stage. For the price of [Global: c4131_IoxuScalpelUpgradePrice] shins - which price will cover cost of imported materials - the scalpel can become more effective, more dangerous."

      <DefaultText>He takes both shins and scalpel from your hands and moves to the workbench. Muttering to himself, he tinkers with the blade and its housing. When he returns it to you, he says, "Modifications are as follows... increased power flows along the blade, although the energy cost and efficiency ratio remain the same, perhaps slightly improved; a sharper edge to the blade; ergonomic update for human fingers."

Physical structure, biological needs, behavior, mental construction, known history of the beast, history of its inhabitants, all these things have I gathered. Where does it originate? I believe a twin star holds the answer, a place of howling winds and immense gravity. Fear tells me that this creature is not yet mature... that the years will see its size increase."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He presses a long, thin strip of metal into your hand, inlaid with tiny circuits and emitting a light that makes your eyes hurt. As it sits on your palm, the inks burn into your skin, and the metal dissolves. "Worry not. A function of the device. Slide your your hand into any exposed joint. Let yourself be impaled within. The ink will call these words to mind." He growls strange syllables. "Your blood carries the overload mechanism now. It transfers energy via the Torvus mechanism."</DefaultText>

Further, much trade comes through these portals, and other, potentially dangerous entities. Why then should we not seek to discover its ways? This work... it is *important.*. It cannot be derailed by... by some pathetic believers. I would reward anyone who can drive them off."</DefaultText>
