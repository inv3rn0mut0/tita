      <DefaultText>A woman, barefoot and in rags, stands defensively beside her tent. Despite her obvious poverty, she crosses her arms and holds her chin high. "And what do *you* want?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She points her chin in the direction of the tunnel that leads out of the courtyard. "They're called Delny and Vrung. They've been squeezing money out of me for months. 'Protection' they call it, though obviously they only mean from *them*. I wish I could do more than simply cave to their demands, but as you can see I'm not exactly equipped to defend myself. It's all I can do to survive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They mock my name. It's what passes for an insult here. I don't look it, but I was once someone of note. Not in the Bloom, of course. To be noteworthy *here* it seems one must be either predatory or insane."

She sighs, lowering her arms. "Those two certainly fall under both camps."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>She lowers her arms. "An offer of help? That's certainly a first. Yes, I admit I could use some. I've had my fill of predators and the insane."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Enough to get by." Her eyes suddenly narrow. "Why? You're not thinking of 'protecting' me as well, are you? You're wasting your time. I have nothing left."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"So you're no different." She glowers but tosses you a small pouch of shins. "I hate this place. I swear it *breeds* predators. Leave now! You have what you wanted, so go!"

      <DefaultText>"I've seen worse predators than you," she says with a glower. "I'll let you rest here for free - that's robbery enough - but as I told you, I have nothing left to give you."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>She takes a step back. "Fine," she says and tosses two pouches of shins at you. Her chin is still raised high, but the fear in her eyes is obvious.

      <DefaultText>"They crawl out of a hole somewhere deeper in the Bloom... Little Nihliesh, I think it's called. I'm not the sort to wish violence upon anyone, even people like *them*, but... I hope *something* happens to stop them."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course you did." She studies you before saying more. "I'm alive. I suppose that qualifies as 'all right.' Still, I wonder how long I can remain so with those two at my throat."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Qianne raises her head in a business-like manner, belied only by her surroundings. "You've returned. I don't suppose you've learned anything new about Delny and Vrung?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You mean Delny and Vrung? Yes, I think that's where they crawl out of. They've been squeezing money out of me for months. They call it protection, but it's obvious who they're 'protecting' me from." She lowers her arms with a sigh. "I wish I could do more than simply cave to their demands, but as you can see I'm not exactly equipped to defend myself. It's all I can do to survive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gives a weak smile and curtsy. "My name is Qianne, the Bloom's most pitiable storyteller and self-styled 'innkeeper.' Though I admit that 'inn' is far too fine a word for my little tent.

      <DefaultText>"You've seen the catena, I assume." She gestures broadly at the massive, broken vehicle behind her, being slowly subsumed by Bloom-flesh. "It's a kind of magical carriage, capable of traveling great distances by skipping over the space in between. Governor Marrizek's priests determined that it came through Stirthal on a very precise schedule - it would appear at one of a few locations near Stirthal every seventy-three hours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I see," she says. Her tone is skeptical. "I suppose they *do* respond to money, and anyway it's more than I could have done on my own. Thank you."

She pulls something from her pocket. "Here. It's not much, but then I don't have much. Consider it a thank you. And you may sleep here for free any time you like."

      <DefaultText>"I see," she says. Her tone is skeptical. "I've tried that myself, of course. But then I suppose you're far more able to back up your words than I am..."

She reaches into a pocket. "Well, I'm grateful for your efforts. Take this. It's not much, but then I don't have much. And if you like, you may sleep here for free any time."

      <DefaultText>Her eyes twinkle with understanding. A small grin appears on her face, then quickly disappears. She almost looks guilty about it. "How peculiar," she says.

"In any case, please accept this in thanks. If Vrung is truly gone, I can afford a little excess." She hands you a little pouch from her pocket. "And feel free to sleep here any time, no charge."

      <DefaultText>"Well," she says, the doubt in her voice clear. "I certainly hope you're right. Regardless, you have done more than I ever could, and you have my gratitude."

She produces a pouch from her pocket "Please, accept this in thanks. If Vrung is truly gone, I can afford a little excess. Also, you may feel free to sleep here any time, no charge."

      <DefaultText>"Well, among the nobles it became a sort of adventure. We would dare one another to board the catena, or even hold parties at a location where it was scheduled to appear. It was exciting! I knew people who went on such journeys and came back with the most wonderful tales. They'd spend a couple of days meeting strange, fascinating people and visiting wild locales - some, I am fairly certain, were not even in the Ninth World. I had to see for myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So about a year ago, my friends and I threw a 'catena gala,' in anticipation of its arrival. We packed and dressed for adventure, and when the carriage arrived, we boarded immediately."

She clasps her hands in front of her and sighs. "Sadly, that was the catena's final journey. It crashed here, tunneling through part of the Bloom. Most of the passengers were killed in the crash, and the rest in the months since. I am all that's left of that voyage."</DefaultText>
