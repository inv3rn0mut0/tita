      <DefaultText>The larger size of this murden and the gray down that covers his head gives him a more stately and menacing look than his compatriots. He hisses at the other murdens and the annoying mental static fades, until only his own harsh static remains. The noise whines and scratches in your head. As the chief 'speaks,' the human woman at his side translates in a dull monotone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You want cloth? Replace it. But not with coin. Not with things. Replace it with *experience*." Her monotone breaks slightly here, the emphasis of the murden's thought pushing more strongly on her. "Flight. I want to hunt in the sky. Give me experience of hunting-flight and dive on prey. Then I return cloth to drinking-man."</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>The murden chief hisses angrily, and a burst of mental static follows.

"No, human. If drinking-man want cloth, he can put drink down and come. He can take it back. If he steal it, it is his. If he not, it is ours. No trade!"

Another burst of static. "May be I need new speaking human shell. Drinking-man not use brain anyway. Wonder if his brain taste like his poison drink."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Stop. No more noise. Terrible. Terrible. Stop."

The murdens back away from you, and their demeanor has changed subtly. They're less aggressive and more fearful, but you can see how their unease might lead to a sudden display of force. They'll still require careful handling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The chief blinks at you for a long, slow moment, as if trying to absorb what you have just said. He obviously can't believe that a human would keep his word.

He snatches the proffered essence from your hand, uncorks it, and tilts a healthy swallow into his mouth. His avian eyes widen as the drug hits his system, and his beak opens and closes involuntarily.

The other murdens grasp their weapons, looking at each other, unsure of what to do.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The larger size of this murden and the gray down that tinges his beak and eyes gives him a more stately and menacing look than his compatriots. His clothes are less tattered, and he projects an aura of command. As you approach, he hisses at the other murdens and the annoying mental static dies down considerably, leaving only his singular field as a sharper source. The noise whines and scratches in your head, and as the chief 'speaks,' the human woman at his side speaks in a dull monotone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The murden chief turns its head back and forth at you, considering. At last, it turns to the nest and pulls the tattered, filthy flag from the befouled tangle. It lets out a long burst of static.</DefaultText>
