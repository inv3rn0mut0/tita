      <DefaultText>This slim girl is almost a mirror of the boy who stands next to her - they could be twins or clones, so close is the resemblance. You can see that her features are sharp, though shadows flit and play too quickly across her face to be sure of anything else. She slumps almost imperceptibly inside her cloak of darkness.

As you open your mouth, her companion interposes himself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the glamour removed from her, you can see Delny for who she truly is - a young mutant woman, slender, her light blue skin accentuated by her bright pink hair. Her features are still sharp, but she still has the softness of youth about her.

Her voice is light but sincere. "Thank you for freeing me of Vrung's influence. His mind was..." She shivers. "This is like waking from a nightmare."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was born in Nihliesh, and my parents were good people. I learned the walkways of the Second Tier by heart. That's how I discovered the portal to the Bloom. I kept seeing the traders who came back from here, and they always had such interesting wares! One day I snuck after them... I wanted to see where they came from." Her face darkens. 

"That was the day that Bloom closed its pathway to my home. I used to think it was my fault, but the Bloom doesn't seem to care for me now."</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He seemed... dark, and fascinating. The adults didn't want me to go near him. But he was like a mirror of what I wanted to be - strong, mysterious, *ambitious*. I let him bend me and use my powers to make him more of what he wanted to be, and I didn't realize I was trapped until it was too late."</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>She considers your words, weighing them carefully. At last, she comes to a decision. "All right. You did help me when you didn't have to. I'll do it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her gentle rebuff becomes much harder. "I said that I didn't think it was a good idea. What I meant to say is that I will not. What if the Maw wants to eat *me*?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>You feel a slight pulse in your tattoo, and Delny begins to walk quickly toward the Maw. "I'll need to be close to it to understand it," she says, "but it shouldn't take much."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He skulked through the dark places of the Bloom, and I thought he was dangerous and alluring. He led me on and took me in, and I didn't realize what sort of person he was until it was far too late."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head as if to clear it, and a small trickle of bluish blood runs from the corner of her mouth, where she bit her tongue or lips.

"I... don't know how to thank you. You must have questions."

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>She concentrates a moment as if trying to marshal some inner strength, and panic begins to creep into her voice. "I... I don't feel that strength anymore. Could it be that I have lost my powers?" She looks stricken. "I can't help you. I am so, so sorry."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Even though I'm still in the Bloom, even though we're still surrounded by all this, even though I need to make amends to everyone I robbed and bullied with Vrung... I feel hopeful. It feels like a new beginning, like... like the night has been peeled away and discarded."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Being free of Vrung is like... like opening my eyes again. But there's another part of my mind that feels like it's *asleep*, and I don't know what happened."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>Delny looks at you for a moment. "Her choices were your decision? That sounds a lot like what Vrung did to me."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're right, I think. Just giving her life wasn't enough. She needs to *help* her victims." Her voice is fierce.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But... if you're going to kill yourself, aren't you always in despair? I don't understand how doing it in the light of rationality makes a stupid decision any better."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But doesn't everyone do bad things in their lives? Would the world be better if all the bad people died before they could fix their mistakes?" She shakes her head. "Never mind."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe once she saw what the effects of her life were, she could have done something to change them. She seemed genuinely sorry at the end." She shakes her head. "But it's too late to talk about that now. The time for thinking about the effects of a life are during the life."</DefaultText>

I found five families who were willing to help me, and who could afford to feed me once every few days. I helped them when I could and kept looking for a way home. But as I got older..." she looks embarrassed. "I needed more excitement. That's when I met Vrung." She looks away, unwilling to say much more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs and says, "You're right, I'm sorry. I owe you at least that much." She turns to walk to the Maw.</DefaultText>
