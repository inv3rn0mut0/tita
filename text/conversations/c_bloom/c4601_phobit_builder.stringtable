      <DefaultText>The glow dims slightly, and the blurry lights on the gem surfaces disappear. You realize they weren't lights at all, but images the phobit was trying to show you.

When they reappear, they show a flat, crystalline plain. Then, one by one, shards emerge. They bud and sprout in the shape of the other phobits. As you watch, they continue growing, creating ridges, walkways, stairs. In one corner you see the Speaker flower out of the crystals.

In a matter of seconds, this entire region of the Ascension has taken shape in the image before you. This phobit built it all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The images in the gems' surfaces change, showing a flat, crystalline plain. Shards emerge, budding and sprouting into the shapes of phobits, ridges, walkways, stairs. In one corner you see the Speaker flower out of the crystals. The images show this entire region of the Ascension, created by this phobit.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The large crystal pulses once. An image appears of a human figure walking through the Ascension into a cave. The details are too fuzzy to make out who it is, but presumably he has the Annulet.

After a while, he leaves the cave. The images move quickly then, crystals growing and shrinking as time passes. Suddenly the entire image shakes and the cave entrance is gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The violet light dims for a moment, and an ominous pulse shudders through your body. An image appears of some kind of multi-legged, clawed creature you've never seen before.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The violet light dims again. The phobit shows you again an image of a multi-legged, clawed creature. It appears to be devouring solid crystal shards.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The light within the crystals freezes in place, and the humming of the phobit ceases. It stays motionless for some time.

Finally, you feel the single pulse of force through your body. *Yes.*</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>You feel a single, forceful pulse. *Yes.*

On the surface of the gems, you see the plateau. It's a picture of the present, you realize, noticing the encampment nearby. A bridge of crystals suddenly forms leading to the plateau.</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>The violet light blinks out for a second - no. Then a second later, you feel the pulse through your body indicating yes.

Nothing else happens.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel two quick pulses through your body. Then the crystal structure goes still.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>You get the strong impression that the pulse means "Yes." It's a different kind of phobit from the others. It may not have the communicative qualities of the Speaker, but it is trying to speak to you nonetheless.</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>This crystalline structure is distinct from all the others. It looks older, more... fundamental, but by no means basic - it is one of the more complex structures you've seen in this place.

Large portions of it glow, emitting a low, rumbling hum that you can feel in your chest. Blurry lights flit across the surface of its largest gems.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>When the cave entrance closes, it doesn't look like a simple collapse. Crystals grow *up* from the ground, as if they're intentionally blocking the way inside.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>You think that's it, when suddenly a new image appears depicting a small plateau near the encampment. A creature is there - your memories tell you it's a quishamis, a being of sentient crystal. It carves something into the ground with its razor sharp appendages.

Light bursts violently from the gems around it. The quishamis crumples, and a humanoid figure approaches it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The quishamis launches crystals into the air - a warning as it dies.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>The quishamis lashes out at the human, impaling it on crystal. But the damage is done, and it too dies.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>The human kneels, taking a piece of it. The stairs leading to the plateau crumble, trapping the hunter. The images move rather quickly then, but you catch glimpses of the hunter panicking, then trying to escape, and finally collapsing, presumably dying of starvation.

Time passes - crystals growing and crumbling around them, until finally both corpses also crumble, becoming a part of the Ascension.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>Then the stairs leading to the plateau crumble, keeping anyone from bothering the corpses. Time passes, and the corpses themselves also crumble, becoming a part of the Ascension.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once again, images on the gems' surfaces depict a small plateau near the encampment. The quishamis lives there, carving something into the ground with its razor sharp appendages.

Light bursts violently from the gems. The quishamis crumples, and a humanoid figure approaches it.</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>There is no pulse. The light continues as it did before. You see your reflection in the surface of the gem for a moment, then nothing.

It looks like that's all you're going to get.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>The thoughts you feel around you give you a better sense of what it means. The hunter himself was not a member of those currently camped at the Ascension, but he was *like* them. Or they are like him. Both came to take from the Ascension.

This phobit does not trust them any more than it liked the hunter.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>The crystals release another single pulse, jolting your body.

You get the strong impression that the pulse means "Yes." This phobit is not like any other you've seen. It may not have the communicative qualities of the Speaker, but it is trying to talk to you nonetheless.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>You feel the ground rumble under your feet. After a few moments, the vibrations cease, and the phobit shows you an image of the cave. The crystals that blocked the entrance are gone.</DefaultText>
