      <DefaultText>One of them - the one that is slightly more vibrant - says, "I was in the house of the Speck, and I chose to explore the experience of being devoured by the Bloom. When I awoke here, my sister waited at my side."

      <DefaultText>The second echo points to the closed Maw. "Soon I realize that there is no salvation for me. I cannot leave this place... I can only suffer. So I give in to despair, and the Maw devours me, and my suffering is at an end." She looks pityingly at her younger self. "There is no escape, my sister. Our road ends here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The first reflection seems hesitant. "My sister matrix is here, it's true, and I might join you again. But it seems clear that I'll come back here anyway. My older self - " she gestures to the other reflection, " - tells me that I'm coming here shortly anyway." She clutches her head. "But if I don't join you, I'm doomed to stay anyway." She fights panic back from her voice. "I don't. Know. What to do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The other smiles, a thin twitch of her lips. "We are the same person. I was devoured in Speck's house, and will be eaten again here. I saw my older sister taken by the Gullet, and have waited for many days... months?... for my younger sister to arrive. Now that she has, I know that my time is near. No matter how persuasive your words, I know that I will enter the Maw, for it devours despair... and on my timeline, despair is all that remains."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>The second reflection doesn't appear to see anyone else. "We can end this, younger sister. Touch the Maw, awaken its hunger, and save the agony of the wait. All you need to do is... stop wanting to survive. Don't make my mistake. Don't prolong our suffering."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The older one shakes her head. "Your logic is flawed, as I recognized when I was younger. You ask her to join you, but she already knows she won't. Who knows better how reality and time are bent and shaped: you or I? She won't join you because she doesn't."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wait," says the younger reflection. "If you can open the Maw without my touch, somehow, then the reality where I open the Maw by feeding myself to it... it never happens. The reality of my older self will collapse. She will never have been. I might join you again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The other stands tall, imposing. "Have you opened the Maw? Have you found a way through? No. Until you do, you have no standing. My sister will wait with me until such time as you can provide evidence of your... outrageous claims."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The other looks at her with venom in her eyes. "Pah!" she says. "Someday you'll return to me."

The older Callistege fades away, disappearing into the floor of the Bloom.

She reconsiders. "But even if I did join you, I'll just become... that *me* there shortly. I'll be back here anyway. It's pointless." She clutches her head. "But if I don't join you, I'm doomed to stay here anyway." She fights panic back from her voice. "I don't. Know. What to do."</DefaultText>
