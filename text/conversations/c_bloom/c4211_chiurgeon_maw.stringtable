      <DefaultText>This is clearly another Maw... though it appears to be older than others of its kind. The whispering voices of the Bloom chitter in your ears, and all other sounds fade into the distance.

      <DefaultText>You drive the Scalpel into the Maw's knotted flesh, and it yields like quivering blubber. Encouraged, you begin slashing through flesh and gristle. The Bloom emits a hissing, seething roar, and a wave of almost palpable hatred passes over you. The ground shakes...

      <DefaultText>Even before you step into the tongues' embrace, they are reaching toward you like the arms of a lover, eager to receive you. In the next moment, they're all around you, stroking your arms and your head, passing *through* your flesh and igniting a prickly, hot-cold sensation across your skull. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You edge forward, making no effort to slap away the tendrils. One of them drifts toward you, brushing against your arm... and passing *through* your flesh with a prickly, hot-cold sensation. Disinterested, the tendril drifts away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In a darkened corner of the Slump, surrounded by waving tendrils, is a knotted mass of Bloom-flesh. The flesh looks thick and old, and you can detect a jagged seam running across its surface, with faint light glinting from within. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Maw remains tightly shut. As you approach, the 'voices' of the Bloom begin to chitter and hiss in your ears.

      <DefaultText>[Anamnesis] You realize suddenly that this is a Maw, and the waving tendrils are its tongues. Somehow, you're certain that you've confronted this Maw before. A moment later, you correct yourself. *You* haven't confronted this Maw before, but the Changing God has... and in a different body. The memory glimmers, half-formed, at the edge of your consciousness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina lays a hand on your shoulder. "A Maw," she whispers, as if she didn't want to draw its attention. Her voice is wary, respectful. "Those waving tendrils - they're its tongues. If it likes the smell of you, it'll take a bite." Her mouth quirks a little. "Probably best for our ilk to steer clear."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Satsada's voice emerges from Riastrad's mouth. "Be wary, and do not stand too close. We stand before a Maw, a living doorway to another place. Those tendrils are its organs of perception - its tongues, if you prefer. It will only open if it feeds, and we don't yet know what it wants."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You realize suddenly that this is a Maw. You're not sure *how* you know, but the word leaps into your mind as if you've seen this thing before. The waving tendrils, you know with equal certainty, are its tongues.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Changing God stands in front of the Chiurgeon Slump Maw... and you realize now that it is uncommonly old. He wears the body of a tall and powerful man - a glaive. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From a leather case at his side, he draws a crystalline object, clasping it tightly in his hand. Its name leaps into your mind - the Magmatic Annulet! This is the artifact that you seek, and it was once possessed by your sire. 

You take careful note of the artifact so that you can describe and recognize it, if need be.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>Suddenly the whispering voices of the Bloom are changed, as if the Annulet is a prism through which they can be understood. It's still impossible to translate the chitterings into words, but *impressions* begin to fill the Changing God's mind - *hunger* and *expectation* and most of all *welcome*. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For the briefest of moments, you touch a massive trove of memories hidden deep within your mind. A torrent of images flash before your eyes, too fast to fully perceive or understand... but you're sure that they belong to the Changing God. The Bloom-tongues quiver and twitch, orienting themselves toward you as if they sense the memories too.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The voices of the Bloom grow a little softer, more accepting of your presence. The sense of recognition that you felt when you first entered the Bloom is stronger now. Somehow, the Bloom must have known the Changing God... and now it senses him more clearly in you.</DefaultText>

You charge down a tunnel, screaming like a madman and brandishing a broken sword, slashing at slimy heads that emerge from all around you, and in spite of the danger you're *happy* because you've got thirty shouting friends at your back, and you've never felt so *alive*...

You cling to the back of a winged creature behind its laughing female rider, and as she looks back at you, you're not sure if she's about to cut the cord that keeps you from falling off...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Bloom-tongues tighten their grip on your skull, becoming more solid, cracking your bones and tearing through the flesh of your scalp. More tendrils burst from the floor and grab hold of your legs. The part of you that is Artaglio begins to scream, and the sound comes out of your own mouth. All around you, the voices of the Bloom grow louder, closer, burning in your ears, drowning out your thoughts...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From a leather case at his side, he draws a crystalline object, clasping it tightly in his hand. Its name leaps into your mind - the Magmatic Annulet! This is the artifact that you seek... and it was once in the hands of your sire, just as Dracogen said.

      <DefaultText>"I can try," Satsada says. At her word, Riastrad steps toward the Maw, reaching out an unflinching hand to touch the tongues. He remains there for a time, then steps back to your side.

      <DefaultText>You get the same impression of *hunger* as before, focused entirely upon Artaglio. There is an underlying intensity to the voices, suggesting that the Maw has been denied its intended prey for some time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You uncork the bottle of thin, yellow gruel. The smell that rises is vile beyond description, like rotting meat mixed with acid, rank with fear. But underneath that fear is a bolder, earthier smell, and you focus on that rather than the sharp scent. It makes the draught go down easier, though you still gag as it clings to your throat. The aftertaste is surprisingly not horrible. In fact, it's almost palatable.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Actually, the aftertaste is becoming quite pleasant. Bold, spicy, large. Your limbs tremble for a moment as a bout of fear shakes through you, adrenaline shorting your limbic system into a purely instinctive fight-or-flight, but that rush disappears, leaving behind a pleasant glow. Your head clouds, your vision tightens, a pressure building behind your eyes - not a painful pressure, but a feeling like you're about to cry... or laugh harder than you've ever laughed before.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No... it's laughter. You can feel laughter welling within you. 

You snort as you consider what this means for Artaglio's legacy - deemed by most a coward dressing himself in the face of a brave man, but underneath is a man whose greatest pleasure is in his friends and in doing great deeds for them. You suddenly understand that his fear is not for himself, but the idea that he can't protect his cohort.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Artaglio's memories burn themselves into your consciousness, and you're not quite sure where his end and yours begin. You feel his mind and feelings jostling for space in your mind.

The Bloom-tongues, which had been ignoring you until now, suddenly orient themselves in your direction.</DefaultText>

Not only that... this Maw is *familiar*. You've confronted it before...

      <DefaultText>Your sire reaches forward a hand, and the Maw opens at his touch, compelled by a bond he has forged in the depths of the Bloom. He steps through the portal and is gone. The memory fades...

{GEORGE/COLIN: I added this node for Critical Success. I think it'd be cool if the player notices something additional in the Mere that leads to either an extra DP or opens up some other reactivity/secret later on. Like maybe he notices something useful about Riastrad or the maw or even something incidental about some other Chiurgeon character who happens to be visible in the memory.}</DefaultText>
