      <DefaultText>This lascar examines the contents of an open hatch in the console before him, brow contorted. Occasionally, he takes a tiny component from the tidy pile beside him, plugs it into the machine's unseen innards, waits a hopeful moment, and mutters what is most likely a curse. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[The lascar shakes his head, saying that he's heard no word of such a test previously. He tells you that if someone wants him to be part of the test, they can ask him themselves instead of passing the world along with visitors.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You snatch one of them up when his back is turned, and toss it over his shoulder. There is a distant clattering. 

The lascar glances at you, confused at the sound, then turns to see what it was.

      <DefaultText>[Happy to talk about his work, he explains that the controls are split into two major groups, with roughly half of them displaying status reports regarding major systems and the other half monitoring various communications channels. He puffs up with pride and says that when the Ship comes to take them away, he'll be the one to first hear the signal.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[It's obvious that no one has expressed this much interest in this man's work before, as he enthusiastically explains that Genjes really does the majority of the work, while he just occasionally presses a button whenever a certain panel lights up. It's not the most challenging job, he laughingly admits, but Genjes wouldn't be able to remove the Cortex if it wasn't done.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[The lascar says instruments report that the door is malfunctioning, but openly admits he has no idea how to fix it. The lascars mostly have military training, and only a few like Genjes have any sort of technical know-how. He notes that when the door first malfunctioned, Genjes left it to him to handle since there wasn't anything important behind the door. He points to the sign on the door and says he did what he could.]</DefaultText>
