      <DefaultText>Whatever this creature was, its stomach was enormous. The organ pulsates, distended with gas... and something else rumbles in its depths as if trapped. 

Foul acidic juices ooze from torn holes in the viscera. It hisses and steams when it drips onto Bloom-flesh.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stomach and intestines rumble and twitch. You can plainly hear something thrashing about, deep inside. 

Acidic juices drip from holes in the viscera, hissing when they touch Bloom-flesh.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something inside the creature's guts is thrashing about. This is not the sound of decay... it's the sound of desperation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The blob reshapes itself quickly, forming into a long, worm-like tube.It sprouts legs and crawls over to a ventricle, and works its way inside. You can follow the toy's progress by the lump it makes through the various arteries that lead inevitably to the stomach.

As Oom reaches the organ, it suddenly retracts and begins its peristaltic motions in hasty retreat through its route.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ventricle regurgitates your companion. It's covered in digestive slime, but seems no worse for wear. It begins constructing a new form.

... and what it shows is a volcano-like orifice with tentacles surrounding a vast maw. It seems clear that a corpuscular maw has somehow become trapped inside the grat corpse's stomach.

      <DefaultText>You reach into holes in the viscera, shoving your arms through rotting intestines, gritting your teeth against the burning pain of the acids and bile within. Finally, you feel dim movement, and you thrust your arms even deeper into the stomach, immersing yourself to the shoulder.

A questing tendril touches your hand. Instinctively, you try to withdraw, but the tendril wraps tight around your wrist. Its touch is unmistakable. The *thing* that was trapped in the stomach is a Maw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You study the stomach for a while, and noting the place where it's most likely to give, land a single well-placed blow to that spot. 

A gout of disgusting, slightly acidic fluids spurts out, and you step aside, neatly avoiding the spume.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You punch and flail at the stomach, but you're entirely unsuccessful. At one point, you bash it hard enough that it sprays a gout of stomach acid from a small ventricle directly into your eye.

It hurts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>More tendrils grab onto your hand, pulling their way toward freedom. Bloom-tongues rip through decaying intestines, spraying stomach juices in every direction. Then the great mouth appears, bursting through the dead flesh. Its tendrils sink into the viscera, anchoring itself in place.</DefaultText>

Unfortunately, you were burned so badly by the acids and bile that you see nothing more. Staggering back, you collapse into darkness...</DefaultText>
