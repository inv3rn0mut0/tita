      <DefaultText>A stunning man in formidable garb greets you with arms wide open. His golden eyes stir strange, unbidden feelings in you. 

"My friend," he says, spreading his arms. "Welcome. I am Aen-tozon." The sound of his deep, rumbling voice makes you think of a waterfall at the rise of the morning sun, beatific and profound. It makes you feel *drunk*.

{SOUND: "Voices" of the Bloom should be audible during this dialogue, similar to what we'd hear at a Maw but lower.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He talks further, but you can't really follow what he's saying... at first. It's just such a pleasure to hear that voice. 

Then, you feel a sensation, like an icy finger on the top of your skull, and the warmth spreading through your limbs cools. The image of the glowing waterfall cascading through your mind dries to a trickle. 

Aen-tozon trails off, watching you curiously.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, not trying. Trying requires effort, and the effect is quite beyond my control," he says with a slight, genuine smile.

"The effect is caused by my passion for studying the web of connections between people, even separated by words or..." he pauses, his smile fading. "Death. Even in death, connections persist."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His humor continues fading. He seems thinner now. Frailer. Less human. His voice is a dry, papery, *ancient* thing. "My studies took me all over this world and to lands beyond the stars before I finally came to the Bloom. Here, my hunger took on a more literal meaning."

Then, he grins again, and the warmth flows from him in glorious, exquisite waves. "But enough about me. I'd love to hear about your connections. Your relationships."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Through the thunderous pulses of pleasure, you see tentacles spilling from within Aen-tozon's clothes.

The Bloom *roars* in agony, and the ground beneath your feet shudders with palpable rage.

Now, we both feed - quite harmlessly, mind you - on the connections between people. I understand the sensation can be quite pleasant."

The tentacles slip reluctantly from his arm. "If you change your mind - if you wish to feed us after all - we will be here. Waiting."

      <DefaultText>His humor continues fading. He seems thinner now. Frailer. Less human. His voice is a dry, papery, *ancient* thing. "My studies took me all over this world and to lands beyond the stars before I finally came to the Bloom. Here, my hunger took on a more literal meaning."

      <DefaultText>"I told you that my studies changed when I came to the Bloom," he says. One of the Maw's tentacles winds around his wrist. "This is how. A Maw claimed me. Now, we both feed - quite harmlessly, mind you - on the connections between people. I understand the sensation can be quite pleasant."

The tentacle slips reluctantly from his arm. "If you wish to feed us, bring a *close* friend to visit us. We will be here. Waiting."</DefaultText>
