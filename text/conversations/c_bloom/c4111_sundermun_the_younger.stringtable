      <DefaultText>"The Bloom is home. Most would think me mad for saying so, even people living here. No denying it is a dangerous, unfriendly place, and it's not like I agree with those crazy cultists who want to be part of the Bloom. But.." He smiles as if telling the world's funniest joke. "But I know I'll always come back here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You'll probably be interested in the specialty items and armor we craft from Bloom-flesh, but we also sell everyday stuff like clothes and building supplies. Everybody buys from us, even those..." He shivers. "Those murdens."

      <DefaultText>"So he told you, huh? At first I thought the old man was just telling tall tales, but I believe him now. He knew too much about me to be anybody but my older self."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm Sundermun's apprentice. That means I do whatever he tells me, really. Mostly harvesting usable Bloom-flesh. It's always an adventure, flesh-harvesting, though my elder tells me I'll be going away on a bigger adventure soon." He grins cheerfully. "Can't wait."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I know of one for sure, in Chiurgeon Slump. Been there a really long time. I hear there's one in the Old Slave Block too, but I don't go in there because of the murdens. So I can't be sure."</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Still looking, huh? There's one in Chiurgeon Slump that's been around for a long time. and maybe another in the Old Slave Block, but I've not laid eyes on it myself."</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It terrified me for a while, but now I think it's great. I mean, not only do I know I'm going to have an amazing adventure, I know for sure I'm going to live through it just fine. I can see what's going to happen to me in the future. I know my fate, and that's incredibly comforting. As for the apprenticeship, well, who could teach me better than myself?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before Sundermun the Elder can take a step, the light fades in the Younger's eyes and the older man vanishes, along with the stall and all its merchandise. All that is left is the corpse of a young man with yellow eyes.

Indeed, a second later, you can't remember why you killed him, or why you had stopped at this particular area of the Bloom. There's nothing here, after all.
