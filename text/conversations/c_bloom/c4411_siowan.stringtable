      <DefaultText>This man seems almost ghostly, transparent, as if his essence had been devoured... yet still he clings to reality, and despair still lines his face.

I made it Gold assuming it will aid Siowan and hurt the player. If it hurts Siowan instead, the Tide should probably be different.} {SCRIPT: TIDAL SURGE}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I see no women. I see a woman and a trap." He smiles slightly. "The Bloom is a predator, with prey from across countless worlds. Do you not think that it has evolved stratagems, decoys, *cunning* to ensnare its morsels? And here, closer to its center, it grows far more intelligent." He shakes his head. "She is doomed, unless she can be convinced away. I don't know how you can do that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the blade passes through his flesh, a look of surprise crosses his face. The scalpel cuts deeply into his insubstantial trachea, and a spray of horrifyingly substantial blood spews from the wound.

      <DefaultText>His translucent body crumbles and flakes, its pieces rising in the air and vanishing forever. You see skin and nerve exposed to the light as the components of his body spill from him.

But even in the midst of this agony, as his essence fades and dissipates, Siowan finds a way to smile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Really," he says, with a scornful smile. A thread of blood spills from an eye socket, and he wipes it, leaving a blurred arc of crimson across his cheekbone.
