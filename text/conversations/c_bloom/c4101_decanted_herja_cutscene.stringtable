      <DefaultText>"You sent this man to fetch me for evaluation without ever seeing me, and now you tell me that I'll be an honored guest? This sounds like forced confinement for the pleasure of wealthy freaks." She shakes her head, backing away. "No. My service is active, and I will return to the mutants if I must.
