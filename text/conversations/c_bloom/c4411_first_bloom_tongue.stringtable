      <DefaultText>You try to unclench your fingers from the Magmatic Annulet, but they don't move. The Bloom-voices fill your head - somehow they're preventing your muscles from responding to your commands.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You try to drive the whispering voices out of your head, but it's too late. They chitter and hiss in every corner of your mind, and you cannot escape them... you cannot even move.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel a familiar sense of powerlessness. Like the last cluster of Bloom-tongues, this one is preventing you from moving a muscle while it tries to feed.</DefaultText>
