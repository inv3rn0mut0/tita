      <DefaultText>Matkina beckons you to her, and she speaks in a low tone. "I have been giving this some thought. If the Bloom is psychically attuned, it should be vulnerable to psychic attacks, yes? And our sire's uninentional *gift* to us - the paincasting - it's both a physical and a psychic curse. You're better at directing it than I ever was."

If the Bloom is psychically attuned, it should be vulnerable to psychic attacks, yes? And our sire's uninentional *gift* to us - the paincasting - it's both a physical and a psychic curse. Your control is about as good as mine, but it's more *effective*. Especially against something like this."

      <DefaultText>" I was going to suggest that you give it some pain of your own to feed on... but you haven't any inside. That means you're going to have to hurt yourself when you're in the midst of those tongues. I don't know if you're strong enough to take it on right now. So rest."

      <DefaultText>Matkina beckons you. On her normally impassive face, you can see the tiniest hint of concern."The Bloom is a predator, yes? And ultimately, it feeds on pain. We give pain, you and I, but your paincasting is more effective in a situation like this. Unfortunately, you haven't learned even the slightest control over it."
