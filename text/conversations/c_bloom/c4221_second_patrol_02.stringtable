      <DefaultText>This man's breathing is labored, and his eyes barely focus on you. Blood has soaked his brigandine armor. 

"You're better off talkin' to him." He nods at his comrade. His voice is soft, almost a whisper. "I ain't got much breath left in me."</DefaultText>

He puts a hand to his side. "Broke one of their beaks with my fist. Got me a couple stab wounds for my trouble. Good thing my kids can't see me now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He jerks away from you, pulling his brigandine coat around him so you can't see his injuries. "No... I don't need no help." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aye," he murmurs, peeling back his blood-caked armor. He looks at you with a mix of hope and dread, probably assuming that you're a healer. 

Unfortunately, you're not. You can see plainly that he's been stabbed several times, and blood still trickles from the wounds, but you have no idea if he has any chance to live.</DefaultText>

Fortunately, you have some knowledge of medicine - or you remember some of your sire's knowledge, perhaps. The soldier's wounds don't smell of corruption, and you're certain they're survivable, but only with treatment... which he won't get until he escapes this cell.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Callistege leans in to examine the man's injuries. "Survivable," she murmurs, "but not for much longer. He's lost a great deal of blood. If he doesn't get out of this 'larder' and have them properly dressed, he'll die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aligern nudges you out of the way, bending down to prod the gashes on the soldier's torso. The man winces in pain, but Aligern pays him no mind. 

"No sign of corruption," he mutters. "Which is a miracle in this place. He'll live, as long as he gets out of here soon and finds a half-decent chiurgeon. Otherwise he'll bleed to death. He's more than halfway there already."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His grip on your shoulder tightens, and his eyes grow wet. "Thank the gods," he whispers. "If I survive this, I'm goin' home. Never lettin' them out of my sight again. Don't care what Brusca says." 

He shakes his head. "Time has a way of slipping out of your hands in the Bloom, that's what they say. I never meant to stay so long."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Little Nym? She's gone?" He shuts his eyes tight and buries his face in his hands. "I killed her... by losing track of time, staying here too long. And for what? A few extra shins?"  He opens his eyes again, and they're hard, determined. "I've got to get out of this... got to go home. My boy needs his father." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A low moan escapes his lips. "Gone... both of 'em. It was me. I did this to 'em." He starts rocking slowly back and forth, eyes squeezed shut, whispering the names of his children over and over.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course he is." He grips your arm, and suddenly he's a hardened soldier again. "Of course he is. And if I have to follow him through this... gateway... by the Black Three, I will." 

He breaks into a coughing fit, and his grip goes slack. "I'm getting out of this place. I'm going *home*, and I'm tracking down my son, and I ain't gonna stop 'til I find him. Not *ever*."</DefaultText>
