      <DefaultText>This door is made of some unfamiliar, shiny metal. It has been polished to a mirror-like sheen. A magnetic strip of another, duller metal has a strange, runic script scrawled across its surface. It looks like an instruction regarding the door.

On trying the door, you discover what that message must be - "This door is stuck," or something equivalent. You might be able to force the door open... but it won't be easy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Some mechanism within the door seems to be stuck, but you manage to overcome its resistance. You hear something crack, and then the door slides open, grinding a bit as it does.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You heave at the door, trying to push it sideways, upward, downward... all to no avail.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You heave at the door, and it gives very, very slightly. Heartened, you shove it again and again, and you hear a grinding sound in the mechanism. You step back, collect yourself, and give the door one last violent shove. 

Something clatters to the ground, and the door flies smoothly open. On the ground is a small component that glints in the dim light. Apparently this was what was caught in the mechanism. You pocket it for later. 

{SCRIPT:  Give a crafting component here.} 

{SCRIPT:  Need to actually open the door when we have real doors.}

      <DefaultText>As you heave at the door, a pleasant voice speaks from a hidden grille. "A-che vostii verminos. Or'tl maryn, siv." 

While you try to make sense of the words, a panel in the door slides open and emits a cloud of choking gas. You inadvertently breathe it in and begin coughing in the mildly toxic fumes.

It seems the door thought you were some sort of vermin.
