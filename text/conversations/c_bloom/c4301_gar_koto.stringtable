      <DefaultText>You stand before a painted, spherical tank, fashioned of metal and synth. The paint is old and cracking. Inside the tank is a murky liquid - or possibly a thickened gas - and every so often you can see motion from a fluke, flipper, or strangely deformed arm within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We are exiles here, far from our home in Nihliesh. It is - " Sparks fly from the grille. "Pardon. We hope that the Maw will open again in our fair city... but if it doesn't, as seems likely, we stand to profit from a potential new trade route. Either way, we benefit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Young mutants," the prince replies, "though not the best of our kind. Delny possessed a great empathy, a psychic reverberation, while Vrung's powers are more subtle. Delny has changed since her association with Vrung, who has always been dangerous... troublesome, perhaps. As long as they do nothing harmful to our people, I do not act. But I will not hesitate should that situation change."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our home is the city of Nihliesh in the Steadfast's Beyond. My cousins of the Fahat rule over the three-tier city wisely and well. When a Maw portal opened in Nihliesh, we investigated to see if we might eke out a profit. We saw enough possibility that our explorers sent for me, a minor prince of the Fahat. I was to head this trade embassy." The speaker makes a slightly embarrassed noise. "I did not think that the Maw would close behind us, but ten years ago, it did."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah... the catena. A year ago, the clocks began to act strangely - speeding and slowing, pulsing - and then the air seemed to bulge in places. We thought nothing of it, considering our surroundings, but then space itself tore open and this monstrosity tore through Little Nihliesh. It pulverized the house of Antuggar and Sauyen, erasing their family. Since then, enterprising scavengers have sought wealth in the wreckage, but most avoid the catena - it is haunted by the ghosts of its passengers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes," the voice murmurs. "This is a perfect trial for our prisoner. She can stand before the Maw, and unless she has completely divorced herself from human feeling, the Bloom will take its due. A fitting punishment. Once she has done this, she is free to go." 

The speaker crackles. "You will find a disk on her forehead. Turn it three times widdershins to release her from her prison. Tell her that if she survives the Maw, she has earned her freedom."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gar-koto hisses in disappointment, and its great bulk thrashes in the tank. "Alas, it would appear that we must remain in the Bloom for now. We shall find another route home, eventually."

The murky gases swirl around the prince's corpulent form. "Opening the Maw has served the residents of Little Nihliesh. Name your fee."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A large sum, castoff. But I agree - the work was dangerous and important. A moment, please."

A minute later, one of Gar-koto's mutants steps forward with a haversack filled with shins.

"This should conclude that business."</DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Free her? We would sooner see her exiled." The prince's amplified voice betrays its distress. "But very well. We will honor our agreement. The disk on her forehead is her prison. Press it into her flesh, circle it thrice widdershins, and her bars will vanish."

It thrashes in its tank. "We hope for her rehabilitation, castoff. See to it she does not relapse."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A cleverly disguised grille on the front of the tank squawks out the distorted voice of the tank's occupant. It buzzes and moans, drawing out some words and shortening others in a burst of static.

"I am Gar-koto, a prince of the Fahat and their delegate here in Little Nihliesh." The voice spits and pops. "Why did you come to our home, and then side with the intruders against us?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you turn, the speaker buzzes once more. "Ah, in case word has not yet reached your ear - I am offering a bounty to the first who can open the newborn Maw... and tell me what lies on the other side."

The voice pauses. "Of course, the first step is to discover what the Maw wishes to eat. Without that knowledge, it cannot be opened."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A cleverly disguised grille on the front of the tank squawks out the distorted voice of the tank's occupant. It buzzes and moans, drawing out some words and shortening others in a burst of static.

"I am Gar-koto, a prince of the Fahat and their delegate here in Little Nihliesh." The voice spits and pops. "Why did you fail to save the Memovira's soldiers from my people?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The flux in the Bloom, and thus the Memovira's weakness, is apparent in the instability of the Maws we use for trade and transport. The old Maws are closing, and new ones open to take their place. There is a new Maw here in Little Nihliesh - one I would like to see opened - but the Memovira refuses to aid me. She won't even leave her fortress."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tank's grille spits a shower of sparks. "The Bloom no longer favors the Memovira. The Bloom is the source of the Memovira's power. If she has no power, the obligation to pay for her protection has vanished. We pay for reality, not promises." The distorted voice crackles with an electric sigh. "Perhaps our people have grown tired of the humans' taking."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The speaker hisses laughter again before the prince says, "The Memovira's rule is short. Preliminary research suggests that the Bloom destroys those who understand it too well. I might suggest that the new Memovira likely has more blood on her hands than I, and I wish no word of my putative ambition to reach her murderous ears."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do you ask for my knowledge or my conjecture? If the first, then I must confess my ignorance. If the second..." Gar-koto pauses, considering, and the grille hisses and sparks when the mutant speaks again. "If the second, I believe the Bloom has a feeding cycle. It is an enormous organism, you know... and I suggest that these events are part of a larger pattern." The mutant's vast bulk shifts in the tank. "Perhaps the Bloom is preparing itself for a new Memovira."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The grille spits and crackles. "No doubt exists of the truth of the relative strength of the Memovira's enforcers and my people. Yet the bloodshed may draw unwanted eyes our way - attention that I would prefer to avoid. Especially in this time of change in the Bloom, when bloodshed could erupt at any time. The Memovira husbands her strength, and will not waste it unless she must."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A moment passes, and then another. "The residents of Little Nihliesh are not always so violent.

I ask that you not judge us based on this encounter... and that you refrain from violence while here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A cleverly disguised grille on the front of the tank squawks out the distorted voice of the tank's occupant. It buzzes and moans, drawing out some words and shortening others in a burst of static.

"I am Gar-koto, a prince of the Fahat and their delegate here in Little Nihliesh." The voice spits and pops. "Why did you not intervene to stop the bloodshed between my people and the Memovira's soldiers?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>A hissing from the grille resolves itself into a machine-like version of a sigh. "I feel much the same way. Unfortunately, there are certain times when problems stand in our path and our inaction is as much a choice as our action. Now, for instance, the Memovira will cast her eye our way as a means of trying to shore up her crumbling strength."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>The grille on the front of the tank hisses. "A laudable sentiment, to be sure. Yet we all come to a time where action becomes paramount, and where we must choose imperfectly."

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>The grille emits something that might be a sigh. "Be that as it may, you have contributed to a greater injustice. I have long sought to keep my people's anger in check. You may have damaged my work. At least, though, the Memovira's thugs will think twice before returning here if they know they might be met with rage. The Memovira wastes her strength at her peril."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"At least you are willing to admit your haste." The voice pauses. "But the blood has been spilt. Perhaps the *threat* of violence will be enough to quell further incursions from the Memovira's thugs in future. She smells the changes in the air. The Bloom is dangerous now, and I would shield my people from that danger."</DefaultText>
