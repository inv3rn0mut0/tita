      <DefaultText>She does not meet your gaze as she greets you, but her eyes rove across your body, watching and weighing. "Traveler. The shop of Sheen lies open before you. Essences distilled. Draughts for quaffing. Experiences delivered a mouthful at a time."

Her voice is flat, though an undercurrent in her voice sings at a register you cannot hear.</DefaultText>

She takes the hair from your hands and begins humming tunelessly and tonelessly as she manipulates the levers and bolts of her strange device. She inserts Artaglio's hair into it and it begins to glow. It pulses in regular time, like a heartbeat, and she lays her hands along its sides. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The gaunt skull of her face transforms for a moment, and you can see the beauty shine through as joy. "The essence of the Hontri! A fresh creation, newly born. A feather and a beak came to my door, the small machines within still writhing and trying to rebuild."

She reaches into her cavernous space and pulls out a milky flask, then places it alongside the other essences on her shelf. "Look amongst the bottles for your needs."</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>When she turns, you realize that the thing you had mistaken for a bundle of sticks and twine is a woman - an impossibly thin woman, her face all angles and lines, her arms summer twigs. Her clothes drape across her like sailcloth, and though her face is young, her eyes are old, old, old.

Her hands are pitted and scarred from alchemical processes, the apparatus for which stands in dizzying profusion behind her.</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen in anticipation. "Sheen has heard of such as you. Dominators and manipulators. Sheen offers essences in trade for these energies. Your offering lowers my prices. Does the traveler accept?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>She closes her eyes, as if picturing Artaglio in her mind. "The man wears the black mask of fear, but he carries the marks of a hero. He carries a soldier's *essence*, but he has forgotten its face." She frowns, and holds up two bony fingers. "Two ways to do such."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Hontri essence? My store possessed that item one time, but a certain traveler has already claimed it. Perhaps a negotiation lies in the future.

      <DefaultText>She pauses to think, her fingers rattling out a complex rhythm on her thighs as if she were cataloguing her inventory. At last she says, "No. But violence, brutality... expose your innocent to these and the knowledge will desensitize her... or him. The taste of this experience showed rage, corpses, entrails. Dreams that night were of devoured bodies. The morning's light was the color of bruises and hurt, and the sight of mortals a vision of walking meat."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That which we eat, that which we drink - this is not the only nourishment in our lives. Without joy, without peace, without happiness or courage, existence itself becomes empty. These states, I recreate, and into dull lives restore aught of glory." She looks proud for a moment. "Clients come to me from across the Protectorate - they desire to open themselves to new sensation, though perhaps unpleasant. Why? I ask not."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One." She holds up her first finger. "Fetch me his skin or bring me his hair, and I can find the truth of the man. A warning - the condottiere will see no change if you give him the essence. You must provide another subject. I mean to say that another must ingest his essence." 

She meets your gaze for a moment. "The Bloom is not gentle. Few would accept your offer, knowing this. Only the truly desperate plot this course."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Two." She lifts her second finger. "You must awaken bravery in him. The draught in your possession, my last - give it to him and restore him to himself."

She closes her fist. "What else demands your attention?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Two." She lifts her second finger. "The bravery sold already. But alas, that has failed, and I have no more. This path to sate the Maw is closed. It must be the man himself."

      <DefaultText>"Two." She lifts her second finger. "I can remind him of his truth. I tell you this - the Bloom will likely devour him. Simply look in my wares, and you shall find the bravery that he requires."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>She holds her breath for a moment, and then bursts forth: "Such pain in this life! Such sadness! A small sample passed these lips, and emptiness swept upon them, a place where silver sparked into lightning, coalescing about a core, and forced its will on another. A wonderful draught. A masterpiece. An essence that completes a course of study. I thank you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As she touches it, the glow surrounds her as well, and it cycles through a kaleidoscope of colors into a spectrum you cannot name but that evokes a painful clarity of emotion. The riot of colors subsides, and the machine ceases to glow, but the colors still play about her hands. She raises them to her eyes. The colors pass within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In a few moments, she begins coughing, great heaving spasms that shake her fragile frame. She glances at you as she retches and holds up a single finger, telling you to wait.

She snatches a small bottle from her countertop, and a stream of thin, yellow gruel rockets from her mouth. She catches it expertly, missing not a drop, and rises from her hunched posture.

She passes it to you. "Stand before the Maw and quaff the essence of the soldier. If it desires him, you will serve in his place."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>She continues, more calmly. "Rather than suffer legal exile, to this place I came. The Bloom sought a piece of my mind, and so I took a piece of its, and from that connection comes the ability to draw essences. Clients seek me now, seek my knowledge, care not whether my modifications endanger me. Bliss." The angry cast of her eye suggests that these memories are anything but. She turns and spits into a bottle near her strange apparatus.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The expression drains from her face. "From the Clock of Kala I hail, superiority made flesh. The city of Sada Emidu, the house above the Indygel, saw my birth. My birthright - to explore, to delve, to *understand*. Yet the Zealitor in his *wisdom*, with his *implants*, told my family that *my* researches endangered me, reduced me from an augur to a mere human!" Her voice has risen to a shout, and she collects herself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then step in with me."

She reaches out for you as she activates her apparatus. Her hand makes contact with you, a rainbow aura settles across both of you, and you feel a connection to her mind - fleeting images of a grand palace arching over a river, a mad flight over polluted swamplands, and great aerial predators that swoop onto unwary travelers in a grassland that seems to have no end. 

You feel the familiar swirl of Tidal energies begin deep within you.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>As the machine continues to whir, you feel her insistent thoughts pushing at your mind. The Tides curl around her. The shell of her mind compresses, her body becomes a puppet to your will, dancing to your invisible strings. Her grasp on your arm tightens as she writhes and screams, but she lets it go on... and on. 

Finally, with a shriek, she releases her grip on your arm and fumbles for a beaker.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>Semi-solid bloody tears spill from her eyes, great gouts of rich and putrid scabrous tissue. She retrieves them with her bottle, scraping the lip of the bottle up her cheeks to ensure that she captures the essence completely.

The apparatus winds down, and the rainbow glow fades. 

Sheen meets your eyes for a long moment. "Let us never do that again. Browse the wares. The cost negligible."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Such an experience should suffice - a lifetime of rage and dreams of blood, distilled into a moment, should create your soldier." She reaches into her strangely cavernous space and extracts a vial, placing it alongside the others. "Browse as you will."</DefaultText>

      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>She slides her fingernails across her forearms, and a brief look of contempt flashes across her face. "Essences, yes, I create. Miracles of life, dead things, Sheen has no part of them. Perhaps the vivisectionists." She gestures vaguely toward the other side of the squalid Slump.</DefaultText>
