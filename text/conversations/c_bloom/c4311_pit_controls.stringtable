      <DefaultText>The console is a bewildering array of displays, unlit buttons, and switches, all helpfully labeled with words in a language you don't understand. Much of it is covered in a slight layer of dust, as if most of the console is rarely, if ever, used by the nearby lascar.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You return to the console, and the buttons flickering under their thin layers of dust. The lascar glances at you, then looks away, consumed by his work. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You lean over the console, taking care to not press any buttons by accident. As you noticed before, much of the device is covered in dust. One screen on the side, however, is completely clean, and the buttons beside it are marked with dusty fingerprints. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You observe him for a handful of broken moments. He divides his attention between his repairs and the buttons to his immediate right and left. 

There's something else about his movements - something potentially useful - but you can't quite catch what it is.</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>You watch him for another few seconds. His gaze flickers between his repairs, a quick scan of the buttons and... up. He's looking up, and in these moments, light ghosts across the surfaces of his eyes. 

There's a strong chance that during these moments, he's... looking at something you can't see. And while he's doing that, he might not be able to see *you*.</DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>The lascar looks back down at the *click*, frowning again.

"Touch?" he says sternly. You do not respond, and after a moment, he returns to his work, eyeing you more often now. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It takes you a good while of staring before you realize why the map looks familiar - it's a top-down view of Little Nihliesh. The Maw is marked, and the greatest details are close to it - probably the map is being generated by sensors that are projecting through it. 

Strangely, there's a flashing marker in one corner of the map. From the Maw, you'd guess it to be about thirty paces to the right, past the exit to the vast interior, in a small cul-de-sac of trash.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You study the map again, trying to mentally picture the location of the flashing marker. From the Maw, you'd guess it to be about thirty paces to the right, past the exit to the vast interior, in a small cul-de-sac of trash.</DefaultText>

      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>You stare at the controls for a moment, then get to work. Leaning on your intuition, you press a number of buttons, watching lights flicker around the room. 

Finally, you tap a neglected icon on a display. The sealed airlock door expels a dark cloud of smoke and shudders open, spraying sparks in every direction before coming to a halt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are now certain that even if he can see past the glow over his eyes, he is not focused on his immediate surroundings. In those moments, you see his mouth moving. Perhaps he is speaking to someone without his voice, and seeing their response suspended in the air. </DefaultText>
