      <DefaultText>A wriggling mass of tendrils rises from the ground. They remind you of the 'tongues' that surround a Maw. Writhing and twisting around each other, they make wet, unpleasant sounds.

      <DefaultText>You grasp the crystalline artifact. At once, the voices of the Bloom grow louder... and louder still. They fill your consciousness, drowning out your thoughts, hissing and whispering and chittering and buzzing. They're coming from every direction, from above and below, from nearby and far away.

Swaying on your feet, you nearly topple to the floor.

Tentatively, you try to direct the motions of the tongues, but they resist you. Like persistent thoughts or a tune that you can't get out of your head, they overwhelm your ability to concentrate, and you are cast out of their mind.</DefaultText>

And move you must - as your boots lose their propulsive power, you must scramble at the sheer rock face for the extra boost, pulling yourself up with your battered hands, trying to reach the eye socket of the mountain-sized statue.

      <DefaultText>A few moments of concentration reveal that the snaking roots of the Bloom-tongues are still connected to the corpses. Hairlike fibers grow through the putrefying flesh, linking to their half-dead brains, keeping their minds alive.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tongues have been gradually drawing out the memories and experiences of the dying human minds and feeding upon them. You force them to extract everything that remains and funnel it into your own mind instead. As each brain is emptied, its gibbering voice falls silent, and it dies. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you finish emptying the dead minds, you sense a deep, sub-aural rumble from the Bloom. Your impression, filtered through the Annulet, is one of *affinity* and *approval* of what you just did.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You close your eyes and relax your mind, probing the limits of your new senses. The roots of the Bloom-tongues run throughout the Trade Post, but they also extend some distance into the surrounding flesh. A few of them trail upward, tracing a path toward an open cavity in the outer reaches of the Bloom. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Steeling yourself, you take hold of all the tendrils at once, urging them back along that path, clawing their way toward the surface and dragging the Trade Post after them. 

The ground buckles and churns beneath your feet, and the whole chamber begins to move...

You turn to look at her at last. Her eyes burn through the blank stare of her porcelain mask. She says, "I've aided you in your researches, uncovered secrets of the Tides you never knew, would never have figured out on your own. I'm twice the thinker you are-"

Your hand lashes out, slapping the mask from her face. You hear it crack on the ground.
