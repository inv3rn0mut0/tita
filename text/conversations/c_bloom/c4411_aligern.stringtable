      <DefaultText>A shaking ghost stands at the lip of the pool. Transdimensional energy tickles your senses with a touch of unreality. It is not until it turns its miserable, guilty face to you that you recognize Aligern.

"You did this. You. All your pestilential kind, your thrice-damned sire. You brought me to this. You put me here." He chokes back a sob. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Bloom is devouring Aligern. He's splayed cruciform against the fleshy wall, the lower half of his body already absorbed into the wall. His face contorts with rage and a silent scream. His tattoos have half-slid from his arms, lashing him down and leaching out into the walls. In the walls, they spread out and change, turning into horrific, vividly colored and primitive paintings of suffering humans.</DefaultText>

      <ID>3</ID>
      <DefaultText>She continues to stab and slice. Aligern's ghost is suffering, screaming, and moaning, The blood from Matkina's blades collects in runnels in the floor, and the Bloom sucks it up greedily. Aligern's ghost is no closer to dying, and Matkina's shows no signs of stopping any time soon. 

It seems likely this grisly tableau will last until Aligern's ghost has been devoured completely.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gestures to the pool. "I could end it. I could leap in and fall to my death. I deserve that." He attempts a ghastly smile. "But I'll stay. Oh, I'll stay. Because what I truly deserve is suffering. Knowing my crimes. Comprehending my failures. Staring into oblivion and denying its release."

He nods. "It's penance. It's the price I pay for my actions.  This is me now. My fate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You might be able to free him, though it appears that his flesh and that of the Bloom is conjoined. You can't tell where one ends and the other begins.

      <DefaultText>His voice is like ashes. "So this is what the Bloom takes from us. I don't suppose you're going to do anything about it." He studies the ghost carefully. He is quiet for a long while.  "That was unfair of me. You couldn't have known. I apologize."

He is almost calm when he says, "I would like to find a way to free this part of me from its existence. To destroy it. I reject this ghost."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her voice is sardonic, almost gleeful. "The mighty Aeon Priest, the man who would judge the world, trapped in a personal hell." She quirks an eyebrow at you. "Leave him here. No more than he deserves, I wager, and he won't thank us for ruining his martyrdom."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But then a flash of movement catches your eye, a piece of camouflage broken by rapid, violent movement.

It's Matkina. She's close to Aligern, and you realize that her hands are red with blood. Her face is a mask of rage, contorted into a vicious smile, and she is stabbing and slashing the helpless Aligern over and over. She doesn't appear to notice you.

He isn't dying. He's just suffering.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at his doppelganger in the wall, and jerks back as he sees what the tattoos have become. Then he looks at Matkina, and his expression is unreadable. "Nice to know where I stand with you."</DefaultText>

She watches the slaughter. "Nothing we can do here. We can't kill him, we can't free him, and anything we do will get that ghost turned on us. Let's go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You plunge your blade into the Bloom's walls, careful to cut around the places where Aligern's hands might be... but the Bloom has absorbed him and *integrated* him. His arms don't terminate. Gray veins and perforated membrane pull from the wall, inextricably enmeshed and intertwined with Aligern's body. The tattoos seem to scream as they pulled from the Bloom.

Even as you consider your next steps, the Bloom heals, sucking him back in. Aligern's dark echo mocks you, sneering and spitting.

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>You reach out to slash the phantom-Aligern's throat. The blade passes easily through his skin, cutting muscle, tendon, and vein with alacrity. But what spills from the angry wound isn't blood or lymph or any fluid you recognize. It's Bloom-juice, for lack of a better phrase, the noisome liquid that courses through the Bloom's arteries.

The ghost holds its hands to its throat and slumps to its knees. Its eyes stare at you accusingly as it falls over and begins to steam, to dissolve.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Aligern-thing offers no defense as you drive it to its knees. Incredibly, its wounds heal instantly, and it laughs as it rises to its feet again.

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Bloom's walls seem to cringe before the edge of your scalpel, and they part like waves before a keel. With a few deft strokes, you carve the man from the Bloom's walls, ignoring his curses as you do so. As you cut through the embedded tattoos, you hear something that sounds like faint, despairing screams.

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aligern's half-digested body lies on the ground of the Bloom before you. The eyes that stare back at you suggest an inhuman intelligence, something not born on this earth. They are filled with hate and rage.

"Your fate, castoff! Your fate someday!"

The body liquefies quickly, like running wax, and like a sponge the Bloom's floor drinks in the fluid.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>He does not look at you, and his voice trembles. "You have my thanks, castoff. Many thanks indeed. I may even forget that it was your hand that put my reflection there."

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>You summon your energies and feel them rise around you. The Bloom pushes back, and you can almost hear its ultraterrestrial snarl as it struggles to retain its victim. Your will against the will of the Bloom, and you can feel its immense strength pushing against your own... but suddenly it relents and releases its victim.

With a wet slurp, the sound of a moistened finger being pulled from a wound, it spills him from its walls.
