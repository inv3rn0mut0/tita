      <DefaultText>Ranard's features are pinched with contempt. "You should be ashamed of yourself. Taking advantage of an enemy's weakness is one thing, but taking advantage of a drunkard is something else altogether." He looks past you at the open Maw, and says, "I hope the price was worth it." 

He spits at your feet. "Never trust a castoff. You do more damage than ten normal folk."</DefaultText>
