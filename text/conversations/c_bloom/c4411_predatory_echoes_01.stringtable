      <DefaultText>A knot of human figures stab and cut at one another, snarling like beasts. All of them are semi-transparent, fading in and out of corporeality. They're a strange, mismatched group, and they seem to be attacking one another randomly. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear a sharp intake of breath, and a pair of combatants disengages. A wild-eyed man turns to look at you - he's wearing the garb of the Memovira's thugs. "Someone is here," he hisses. "Someone to kill."

The others break away from each other and advance in your direction, faces twisted in mindless rage...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear a sharp intake of breath. The false Matkina raises her head, like a hound sniffing the air. "Little brother..." she hisses. All of the combatants turn in your direction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A hideous light dances in the shade's matte-black eyes. "I will read our future in your entrails." She raises a knife in mock salute and glides toward you, her chameleon cloak rippling and shining. Her white face is cold and still, an alabaster mask, but the unholy glee in her eyes...

*This* is the White Death of the city's nightmares.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lies!" she whispers. "I *am* the White Death, and you are... you are..." She raises her blade, but doubt creeps into her face. She studies you carefully, taking in your face, your bearing, your tattoo... and suddenly she folds in on herself. The rage and hatred vanish from her eyes, and she lowers her knife.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Confusion and loss radiate from her slight form. She raises her hand and looks at it carefully, and drops her blade to the floor. She touches the ground, resigned, and the Bloom inhales her, like a sudden intake of breath.

The other shades stare at her, and then they too flicker out.</DefaultText>

She and the other shades leap into the fray.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She blanches as your stern tone washes over her. She cringes, drawing back, and in so doing, the venom and spite disappear from her face. "I am... I am the White Death," she whispers. "None may... speak to me... like that."

She lowers her knife.</DefaultText>
