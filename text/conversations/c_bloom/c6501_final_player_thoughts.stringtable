      <DefaultText>Wordlessly, everyone goes their separate ways, moving through the blackened, bloody rubble. There is nothing more to be said, after all. 

And then, the ruined fortress is silent, and utterly empty. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yes. New homes, untouched by fire or the ravages of the Endless Battle. The curve of the sky above, golden blue. 

Maybe even someday - somehow - the laughter of children...</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>Yes. Your bond with the Bloom will make this possible. And when it comes time to pay the price as the others have done? Well, you've dealt with the Sorrow and emerged alive. 

The Bloom will not be any match for you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your words ring boldly in the smoky air, and you smile at the sound of them. Let lesser creatures question themselves. Let others shudder and tremble at the coming of night.

      <DefaultText>You look away from the diseased patch of air, but this place is not much better. You are surrounded by blackened, bloody rubble. By death. It is time, perhaps, for some fresh air.

      <DefaultText>Yes, for you are the Changing God. Immortality is still beyond your grasp, but only just. Let the Sorrow come again, if it even can. After all, you've already beaten it once. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yes. Your bond with the Bloom will make this possible, and your competition will be weakened by the madness that plagues this place.

      <DefaultText>Yes. You will fix this, though you're not sure how. Not yet. But you have the time, and you will gather allies to help you.
