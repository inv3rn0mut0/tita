      <DefaultText>Aligern looks around. "Not a bad place to call home, I suppose. You'd have to clean it up a bit, carry out some of the bodies..." He catches your look. "You're the new Memovira. The Bloom is yours."

      <DefaultText>Callistege's voice is *hungry*. "Do you realize how much power is concentrated here? In so many dimensions, in so many realities, this place is a nexus... and its power is yours." She sees your questioning look and says, "You have become the new Memovira. Not merely a title - you are the speaker to the Bloom."

      <DefaultText>"She's finally dead. Finally." She looks at you. "You realize that you're the new Memovira, yes? You've taken control of the Bloom. It's not just a title - you're the speaker to the Bloom, and it responds to you. But then we've got the matter of our sire to settle."

      <DefaultText>Satsada speaks through Riastrad's mouth, her/his voice urgent: "My friend, my leader... the thrice-cursed Memovira held the device that shunted me aside from reality somewhere in the vault. I beg of you to find it, either on her person or in this tower. I long to be reunited with my love."

      <DefaultText>"Well, *that* was heroic. Heroic indeed!" Erritis looks around confidently, his glow bright. "Say, are you the new Memovira? I mean, you took control of its heart and now the old Memovira is dead and I think the way this kind of thing usually works is that you're the new Memovira. Am I supposed to bow? Because I don't usually bow to people." His voice drops to a whisper. "It's not very heroic."

      <DefaultText>Tybir makes an exaggerated bow to you. "M'lud, your faithful servant awaits." He has a gleam in his eye. "Just think of how much you can bring in now. You'll be able to finance anything you want, any - " He pauses, seeing your look. "You're the Memovira now, lad. Talk to the Bloom, take out the old leader... wait, is this the path for all Memoviras? You've got your work cut out for you, then."

      <DefaultText>She scuffs her toe on the floor. "I guess that means we're not going anywhere else then? I mean, you've got to stay and look after the Bloom, right? Well, how about I make some gods for us and they can help us clean up? We'll be nicer rulers than the last Memovira was, right?"
