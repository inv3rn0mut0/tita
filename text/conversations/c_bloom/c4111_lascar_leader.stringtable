      <DefaultText>Then she reconsiders her words. "Ordinarily hospitality is ours. Forgive this one. The Maw to our anchorage has closed." She indicates the hideous, tentacled 'mouth' that lies dead in the center of the platform.

"Another way we must find. Have you word of open Maws that lead to our station?" She lowers her voice. "Beseech you, even. Trapped here with the supplies we purchased for our compatriots."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For the first time, a broad smile cracks her face. "A savior. Truly, the opener of the ways who can rescue marooned travelers." She turns and speaks to her crewmates. "Challan askun toveld! Getsa!"

She turns back to you and presses a small device into your hand. "Is useful. Old but reliable."

      <DefaultText>These three humanoids wear intricately carved armor that makes them look like undersea dwellers of legend. You cannot recall having seen the material from which they are shaped, either. Though the suits are bulky, their wearers move with a strange and fluid grace. You might have mistaken them for monsters, but their leader is unhelmed and appears human. She has close-cropped hair, an angular face, and her jaw is clenched, as if she were subconsciously chewing on a problem.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lascar smiles broadly when she sees you. "Met my people as they migrated Home. Remained behind to thank. You are a savior of all lascars."

She presses a small device into your hand. "Is useful. Old but reliable. All I have to offer in thanks." She smiles again, places a hand gently on your arm, and then follows her comrades' path to a long-awaited homecoming.</DefaultText>
