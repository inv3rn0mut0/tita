      <DefaultText>All of the cables in the room connect to this bulky machine and its twin. They generate a low rumble that you can feel in your feet. 

As you approach, a screen lights up. A strange, mazelike rune flashes angrily in the center of the screen. Three other glyphs revolve slowly around it in an elliptical orbit - a bolt of lightning, a set of parallel lines, and a circle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Although you can't read the runes, the gist of the message becomes clear. It's a warning about the device with the two crystals at the center of the chamber. The device has deteriorated to an unstable state, and *any* fluctuation in power is likely to result in an interruption in function.

The runes do not say what will happen if the device ceases to function, or if they do, you cannot decipher it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You catch snippets of meaning here and there, but the gist of the message eludes you. It seems to be a warning about the current state of the device with two crystals at the center of the chamber, but whether it is a call to action or a warning against such is unclear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nothing happens for a moment or two. Suddenly, a series of strange popping sounds emanate from the device in the center of the chamber. On the screen, the image of the device begins to flash, and red parallel lines cut through the part where power once flowed into it.

Arcs of energy jump over the surface of the device for a few moments, then cease. The cavern becomes eerily quiet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An image appears depicting the humming device in the center of the room - the one with two crystals. Symbols flow into the image, showing that the device is currently receiving power from the machine before you.

A circular symbol pulses each time a symbol flows into the image. Pressing it would likely cut the flow of power to the crystals, causing the humming to cease. 

The circular symbol is outlined in red, suggesting that the function of this device is particularly important.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The screen cracks and shatters under your mighty blow. You continue, smashing the frame and the housing until the machine itself goes dark.

The devices in the rest of the room go dark as well. The humming that once permeated the cave grows eerily silent.

An energy field near the entrance of the room disappears.

      <DefaultText>*The three geodesics through the barycenter are the key.* Watching the glyphs revolve around the central rune, the meaning suddenly becomes clear. The symbols increase and decrease in size as they move around the rune, traveling more quickly when they come close to it and slower when they're farther away.

They aren't revolving. They're *orbiting*, and the rune is the barycenter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The notes said, "The three geodesics through the barycenter are the key." You hoped that looking at the generator's interface might make that clear, but it doesn't. The 'clue' makes as much sense now as it did when you first heard it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The rune and glyphs disappear, replaced with an image depicting the bank of three large crystals to your right. Symbols flow into the image, showing that the device is currently receiving power from the machine before you.

A circular symbol glows next to the image. Each time one of the symbols enters the image of the crystals, the circular symbol pulses brightly. Pressing it would likely cut the flow of power to the bank of crystals.</DefaultText>

A phobit blinks and chirps within one of the large crystals, finally freed from its imprisonment. It zips around in the crystal, makes cheerful noises in your direction, then vanishes in a flash of light.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The definition of geodesic rises from the depths of your mind as well. It means a great circle track - the shortest line between two points on a sphere.

On a hunch, you draw a line from each of the three symbols to the others, curving the line through the rune in the center. The symbols stop orbiting. Lines appear where your finger drags across the interface. Soon you have three curved lines connecting each of the symbols - three geodesics through the same barycenter...</DefaultText>
