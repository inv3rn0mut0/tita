      <DefaultText>"Stories," she murmurs, "passed from one Speck to the next. So many stories, told by so many tongues. Too many to hold in my head, but the Bloom remembers, and it whispers in my ears to remind me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her small hand enfolds the stump of her missing arm, a self-conscious gesture. "I'm only a Speck... a mote of dust, easily missed. Nothing important, save for the words I speak, the stories I tell to those who would hear them. But I observe much that passes in the Bloom, and I hear still more in its whispers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One gets to the Heart in the same way one gets *anywhere* in the Bloom - a Maw will you take you. And the Maw you want is just over there."

The Speck waves a hand toward the nearest corner of the shrine. You feel like a blindfold has been suddenly pulled from your eyes, and a wave of vertigo nearly knocks you to the floor. When you look up again, a *Maw* has appeared.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old woman glances about, eyes falling on the piles of smelly rags. She bends down, runs a finger along the 'floor,' and finds it covered in grime. "A caretaker, perhaps. A strong pair of arms to wield a broom and scrub our rags. I can't promise what I don't have - and by that, I mean coin - but he'll have food and a place to sleep. I'll ask the Bloom not to eat him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In a shadowy corner of the shrine lurks an old woman, so tiny and unremarkable that she blends into the gloom. She's been watching you since you arrived, following you with bright, intense eyes. You notice that one of her arms is missing at the elbow.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"The whispers told me you were coming, Castoff. They often do, when someone they regard as *interesting* finds their way to the Bloom." 

Her voice is soft and shifting, as if everything she says is echoed by the chittering voices of the Bloom. </DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>Suddenly she is at your side, one small hand touching your arm. Her eyes probe yours. "Did you come here with purpose? Do you know what place this is?"

You realize that this shrine *does* feel familiar, as if you - or perhaps the Changing God - have been here before.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Wait, Castoff." Suddenly the old woman is beside you. Her movements are astonishingly quick, showing none of the torpor of old age.  "The whispers spoke of you, from the moment you arrived in the courtyard."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The whispers told me. They talk to themselves, mostly, but they don't mind if I listen." 

She cocks her head, birdlike, her eyes straying to your castoff tattoos. "You're not the first of your kind to hide in the Bloom. The others were drawn by fear or instinct or the unconscious knowledge that the *thing* that hunts you cannot follow... for death has no place here. Only hunger."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You scan the room, searching for anything that might seem familiar. A metallic gleam catches your eyes from the nearby slab of stone. It lies partly buried beneath a motley pile of 'offerings,' but the unusual shape of the metal sparks a memory...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You scan the room for something... anything... that might be familiar and thus spark a memory. But you see nothing, so you turn back to the old woman with a shrug.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Anyone could have told you that. Or you might have read the scriptures." The old woman gestures at the fluttering papers that hang about the shrine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old woman follows your gaze. "He left that as an offering, your sire did, when he was here."

You can almost feel the weight of the device in your hand. With a sudden, jarring clarity, you see the chamber as it was forty years past, when the Changing God stood before a group of robed Bloom-cultists, offering the device in trade for information.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>And in the corner, an elderly woman, birdlike, with shining eyes. This woman you've just met, or someone much like her, was at the shrine then too. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He pored over every scroll," she whispers, half to herself, "wanting to learn how Chila forged a *friendship* with the Bloom, a bond that imposed no price upon her. Or so he thought." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In coming here, you crossed your sire's path. Years ago, he stood where you do now." The old woman looks toward the stone slab nearby, piled with junk. "He left an offering, a piece of his handiwork." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because they think the Bloom is divine? Forgive them their misconceptions." She raises a playful eyebrow. "Not all of us are children of a god."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well enough." Her bright eyes fix on the young man. "The whispers like him. A faint aroma of murder, suffused with a decade's worth of shame and a dash of innocence. They find him a pleasant mélange, a perfume too precious to devour."

Her mischievous smile returns. "He's also good with the laundry."</DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Definitely not. She was the *Insignificant* Speck at first... and the *Manipulative* Speck when she wrote the chronicles. I am the *Observant* Speck, which is a very different sort of Speck."

"Ever since the time of Chila, there has always been a Speck. So many across the years, it's hard to keep them straight."</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Do I seem it? All a-chanting for salvation, sticking my head into Maws and begging the Bloom to eat me?" She gives you a mischievous smile. "No. They let me stay because I hear the voices of their god. And to tell them stories. I think of myself as a caretaker... not of a place but of a legend."</DefaultText>

      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>The old woman glances down at the stump of her arm, and a shocked expression crosses her face. "I... must have forgotten. How strange." 

She cocks her head, addressing the whispers that only she can hear. "Did *you* eat it? Did you?" After a few moments, she frowns and turns back to you. "Nothing. They don't answer me at all..."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>

      <DefaultText>"In the market, we decide to make our stand. Chila knows that her enemy, the boss of Sagus, the woman who killed her parents and turned her brother against her, can't ignore us. We form up into ragged lines. Then we hear them... the roar of the soldiers, the tread of heavy boots getting closer, closer..."

Somehow you can hear them too, along with the terrified murmurs of the slaves as they grip their weapons and prepare to fight for their lives.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Noise... confusion..." The Speck's eyes are still closed, but she staggers back, raising a hand to defend herself against an invisible attack, as if she thinks she's in the midst of a battle. You can faintly 'hear' the screams and cries, the clank of steel on steel. "I stay by Chila's side when the battle is joined, I try to guard her back, but... she's struck. First by an arrow. Then by a blade."</DefaultText>

When she touched the artifact - her birthright - it became a part of her, changed her, so that she cannot be killed. She smiles, raises her hammer, crushes the skull of every soldier who stands against her."

She grabs him by the foot and smashes him into the ground. But instead of killing him... she speaks to him. It's a whisper, and I can't hear what she says... but Shade begins to weep.

      <DefaultText>"Of course." A smile spreads across her face. "But that device was a gift, so another gift must be provided in return." 

Even as she speaks, you notice tendrils of Bloom-flesh rising quickly from the floor, and others, even smaller, curling from the surface of the offering slab, fastening themselves around the Merecaster. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods slowly. You notice that her eyes are clouded, her movements slower than before. "How to restore what I was... without even a clue to guide me... and a body so weak, so weak? No hope, Castoff." 

The Speck is growing *old* before your eyes, her hand trembling, her body stooping. "What I lost will never be found... and now the whispers have abandoned me, too."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Coming to a decision, she nods her head. "Take the device - it's yours. I'd rather see it in your hands than buried and forgotten here." 

She plucks it from the pile of offerings and gives it to you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>340</ID>
      <DefaultText>The device is cylindrical in shape, wrought from azure steel, with curved, sharpened projections on all sides, making it difficult to hold. It feels *familiar* to you, like a family heirloom that you've only heard about in stories but always pictured in your mind. Somehow you know that it's a Merecaster.

You can almost feel the weight of the device in your hand. With a sudden, jarring clarity, you see the chamber as it was forty years past, when the Changing God stood before a group of robed Bloom-cultists, offering the device in trade for information.

And in the corner... the woman you've just met, or someone very much like her, was at the shrine then too. Speck was her name.</DefaultText>
