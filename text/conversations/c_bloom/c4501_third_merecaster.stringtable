      <DefaultText>This Merecaster is large, almost like a sarcophagus. A myriad of ports and slots of various sizes, shapes, and depths mar its surface, as if it should have been suspended from a rack for entry and anchored with hoses. It gives off the impression of great age.

An insistent voice in your mind says that you need to enter it to activate the Merecaster, but you cannot see a way into the device.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is made of a strange metal, much like the other two Merecasters the castoffs of Miel Avest entrusted to the Memovira. Looking more closely at it, you see that the deepest port here almost perfectly matches the shape of Endira's Merecaster.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You have joined Vicarian's and Endira's Merecasters. They seem to have fused together, and now the two of them emit a deep and throbbing hum. The sarcophagus appears to be cycling in color in time with the hum, red and silver.</DefaultText>

{COLIN/GEORGE: The option to fuse the two Merecasters together and then put them in later feels strange to me. What if the player walks away? Won't he still have two separate Merecasters in his inventory?}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It goes down easily enough, prongs first, and the top of it protrudes from the surface of the sarcophagus. However, it doesn't appear to do anything. You pull it back out.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>They fit neatly together, the two prongs of Vicarian's Merecaster slotting perfectly into those of Endira's. They fuse together, and hum and begin to cycle. The sarcophagus seems to hum as well. Vicarian's Merecaster forms a neat handle, protruding slightly from the top.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yes... yes. This machine is of a piece with Endira's and Vicarian's Merecasters. You'll need to join the two of them, place them into a port, and then activate the device. That should open the sarcophagus.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You connect the two Merecasters together, and they fuse as you do so. They hum and begin to cycle, as does the sarcophagus. You place the joined Merecasters into the deepest slot on the sarcophagus, rotate the handle of Vicarian's Merecaster, and the sarcophagus powers fully to life. A pulse of red and silver light flickers from within, and it cracks open, ready for your use.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear it neatly click into the two holes on Endira's Merecaster. The two of them fuse together - you can feel the vibration through your hand. A low hum emerges from that port, and you can hear the sarcophagus humming on the same note.

      <DefaultText>It slides in as if the port were designed for it. You hear it click into place in the bottom. You try to pull it back out, but it remains fixed, a permanent part of this sarcophagus.
