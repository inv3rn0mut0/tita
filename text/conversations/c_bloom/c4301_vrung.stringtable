      <DefaultText>This sharp-faced young man reminds you of a great rodent, more prone to scampering and sidling than running or walking. Shadows play across his face, distorting his features, and you are unable to get a clear glimpse of his face. Even so - or perhaps especially because of it - he seems to bear a notable resemblance to the young woman standing next to him, their faces shifting and changing in near-perfect time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At your approach, he sniffles loudly and drools some phlegmy spit across your path. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, and though you can't see his face, his tone conveys the sneer clearly enough. "What d'you want, popinjay?"

His voice echoes eerily, a slight delay between the movement of his lips and the sound reaching your ears.</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>You touch the Annulet and focus on Vrung. You sense his mind, a nest of rage and envy, Touching it is akin to thrusting your hand into a sack of writhing, biting insects. 

You feel a strong connection between him and Delny, a vise clamped over the girl's mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the shadows melt away like a morning mist, his partner's face fills out, revealing pleasant, girlish features. Her true skin is a pale blue, and her hair is bright pink. A broad smile crosses her face.</DefaultText>

He turns away, dismissing you.

      <DefaultText>When Vrung awakens, he is lying on the ground, and you are kneeling next to him. Your finger in his face, you speak quietly but urgently about his life, his sanity, and any surviving members of his family. You reduce him to shivers and trembles. He stammers, "I vow to leave this place, never to return, and I'll never trouble another like this." When you let him up, he flees as if trying to outrun a falling star.

Delny smiles.</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>Delny closes her eyes and kneels next to the unconscious man. She places her hands at his temples, and you see a purplish electricity arcing from her fingers. Vrung begins to scream in his sleep, the pitch going higher and higher, until he tears himself from the arms of sleep. He leaps to his feet, and not even looking at his victim, flees as if pursued by a pack of broken hounds.

Delny watches him go, satisfaction wreathing her face.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>You reach out to the sleeping man, and you snap his neck with a single practiced twist. Delny's face is satisfied... but underneath that is a frisson of fear.</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>He laughs scornfully. The woman at his side echoes him a moment later.

"Sure, boss. I'm leaving her alone right now." His mocking grin turns to a glower. "But just remember you can't watch her forever."</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks at you, suspicion dawning in his eyes. "What are you doing?" he hisses.

But you have found the cracks in his mental shields, and you imagine them widening, shattering. He realizes too late what you're doing, and his resistance is feeble - especially when compared to the power you can draw upon.

He stiffens and falls backward, convulses, and is still. The shadows slither off his body, evaporating like a foul mist. He's just a scrawny boy, a weasel-faced sneak.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>His psychic shields are strong enough to resist you, but only barely. His eyes wide, their whites showing even through the shadows that crawl across his face, he gathers himself to flee. The shadows swarm over his body and then coalesce into a single point in the air, and he is gone. The rush of displaced air *pops* with his passage.</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>Vrung's rage seems to have loosened his control over his companion, for you see a flash of blue skin beneath the shadows. Her mouth works frantically, as if she is trying to tell you something while her captor struggles with his fury.

With an effort of visible will, Vrung brings himself - and her - back under control again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The young man opens his mouth for a sarcastic comeback but realizes that you might be serious. He holds his hands up to placate you. "All right. All right. One moment."

He concentrates... or rather, *doesn't* concentrate, and the shadows flow away from his face and body. He's a much scrawnier person than you thought, almost gaunt, and he doesn't look at all dangerous or menacing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She mutters something. An apology, maybe, a prayer? Her back arches, and her eyes roll back in their sockets.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>She continues shaking and jerking for a long time. Her heels drum on the ground; her hands beat an uneven tattoo as her arms flail and twist. At last, though, the seizure passes and she opens her bloodshot eyes.</DefaultText>

      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>A roaring nightmare, a blistering wall of fire, memories of blood and pain and tentacled horrors - these frightful images spill into your mind, decaying and corrupting, but they wash past quickly. Your mind reels as if you'd been on a two-day bender with the cheapest alcohol, and a stabbing headache has taken up residence behind your eyes... but Delny is waking, none the worse for wear, her seizures abruptly gone.

      <DefaultText>Her eyes snap open in blind terror, seeking any refuge from the nightmares that seem to be replaying in her head. She sees you then, and she begins to relax immediately, her muscles unclenching one by one, and she eases out of her seizure.

"Thank the gods you're not Vrung," she whispers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out and snap his neck before he can react, and his body collapses to the ground at your feet. The shadows slither off his body, evaporating like a foul mist, and his true appearance is revealed: he's just a scrawny boy, a weasel-faced sneak who doesn't look like he could threaten anyone.

      <DefaultText>He leans out of the way just in time to avoid your attack, and his eyes fill with fear. He turns to run, and as he does, the shadows surround him completely and then coalesce into a single point. With a loud *pop* of displaced air, he is gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He cries out as you wrap your hands around his neck. He struggles, clutching at your hands, growing weaker and weaker until he stops moving.

      <DefaultText>You don't seem to do any good. Her seizure goes on for minutes, her face contorting in an awful rictus. You watch helplessly as she writhes in agony.

      <DefaultText>Something in your manner, your aura, your possession - you don't know what the deciding factor was, but you manage to ease her into the perfect position and pull her through the worst of the seizure quickly.

      <DefaultText>He steps back at your sudden vehemence, fear writ large across his face. The woman at his side steps back too, mirroring him a moment later. 

"It... it was just a bit of fun. I'll leave her alone, I promise!"

      <DefaultText>He laughs scornfully. The woman at his side echoes him.

"Sure, boss. I'm leaving her alone right now." His mocking grin turns to a glower. "Words are wind. You can't watch her forever."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He jumps back, the fear obvious on his face. "All right! All right, I'll do it. Hang on."

He concentrates... or rather, *doesn't* concentrate, and the shadows flow away from his face and body. He is a much scrawnier person than you thought, almost gaunt, and he doesn't look at all dangerous or menacing.

      <DefaultText>You reach out and snap his neck before he can react, and his body collapses to the ground at your feet. The shadows slither off his body, evaporating like a foul mist, and his true appearance is revealed: he's just a scrawny boy, a weasel-faced sneak who doesn't look like he could threaten anyone.

      <DefaultText>He sees your attack coming and laughs. Before you get anywhere near him, the shadows surround him completely and then coalesce into a single point. With a loud *pop* of displaced air, he is gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You scatter his feeble mental shields with your assault, and his eyes roll back into his head as the muscles of his body lock into place and your mind asserts its control over his. He totters straight backward, and he loses consciousness as his head strikes the ground. He shakes and convulses, and then is still.

      <DefaultText>He must see the intent in your eyes, because he immediately gathers himself to flee. The shadows swarm over his body and then coalesce into a single point in the air, and he is gone. The rush of displaced air *pops* with his passage.</DefaultText>
