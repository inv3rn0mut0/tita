      <DefaultText>Papers lie scattered haphazardly across this desk. Small knowledge cubes gleam, finger-sized implements cast processions of glowing glyphs, and other media lie scattered throughout the mess. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you shuffle through the varjellen's notes - on paper, scribbled on dried Bloom-flesh, dictated into talking data cubes, and recorded in more exotic storage devices - you realize the sheer volume of information he has collected. It is a trove of arcane and technical observations of the Bloom, loosely organized into a number of categories: Behavior (Self/Others), Communication (Self/Others), Influences, Influenced By, Maws (How to Open, How to Close, How to Divert), History (Unrecorded/Recorded), Observations, Conclusions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you reach out to examine the objects on the desk, the varjellen barks, "Careful! Much time has been invested in this work, and I recall where I placed each bit of data. Replace where you found each item."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The varjellen has stopped glancing over as you shuffle through his notes. Instead, he is staring at you, waiting and watching. It becomes difficult to concentrate under that steady gaze, so you put the notes down and step away from the table.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Every data point leads to a reference in another document. Some of those links are simply notes guessing where the data is located, based on the varjellen's recollection. If you knew where to start analyzing his enormous collection of knowledge you might be able to get somewhere... but the volume of information is simply staggering.

A team of Aeon Priests couldn't process this much data in a year. For a lone scholar, it would likely take ten years or more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The data the varjellen has collected is staggering in its scope and depth. He took physical and psychic measurements, correlated the Bloom's movements with historical events, and created broad categories of knowledge. You're certain that if you just had a quiet decade or two, you might be able to make sense of all the knowledge he collected.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If you had a quiet decade or two to yourself, you might be able to write a scholarly thesis that could be of benefit to others who might wish to study the Bloom. You don't, though, so you set the data aside.</DefaultText>
