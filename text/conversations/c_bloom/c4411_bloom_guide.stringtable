      <DefaultText>This dead woman bears numerous stab wounds, probably inflicted by the predatory 'echoes' that seem to infest the Gullet. Judging by the scrawled maps and notes that are stuffed amongst her things, she may have been an explorer or a Bloom-guide. It looks as though her belts and pouches are mostly intact.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You realize that the guide's belt is no such thing. It's a length of synth rope, about 15 meters long, and as you touch it, it uncoils from her waist... almost as if it were responding to your need. It coils itself toward you, and you place it among your possessions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You kneel down next to the corpse and let your trained eyes rove across her body. Here, a pouch seems to bulge, and your hand dips in and returns with a handful of shins. There, a pocket lies flat and you ignore it.

      <DefaultText>The woman's corpse bears numerous stab wounds, but her belongings are mostly intact. Her flesh is beginning to decay in the moist, acidic air of the Gullet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Going through the corpse's pockets and pouches more carefully, you turn up a fair number of shins.
