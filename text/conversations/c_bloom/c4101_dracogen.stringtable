      <DefaultText>He holds it up to the light, turning and admiring the Annulet's cunning design. A wide smile on his face, he says, "Can you feel the power of this thing? It twists and curls, ensnares the secret places of the world. This will do nicely. Oh yes."

He places it into a flat pouch at his hip - and no shape distorts the pouch, as if it were merely a gateway to some larger place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dracogen's flat eyes rove quickly across you, measuring and studying in a glance. He smiles warmly, but his eyes remain hard. "You return, and more quickly than I had anticipated. Do you have something for me, perhaps?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyes search your face, and then he smiles his too-sharp smile. "You have something of value? I may accept that indeed, but its value must be of equal worth." He pauses. "Or better. Be warned, though, that my tastes are... peculiar. Get me something unique, and we may be able to arrange a trade."</DefaultText>

      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>He pauses and considers his options. All the while, his gaze never leaves your face. At last he nods sharply and says, "Very well. I'll accept that you've found it, and that you intend to honor our arrangement. Tell none that I have offered you this freedom. I will hold you to this, my friend." He looks distinctly unhappy.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My friend, you return. I hesitate to remind you that you promised me the Magmatic Annulet. I expect delivery soon." His too-sharp teeth bare in a grin that is not entirely friendly. "Very soon."</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>His smile disappears as he considers your words. He licks his lips nervously and places his hand to his forehead as if he were suddenly stricken with a headache... or if he were communicating. He looks up after a brief moment, his smile returning, though not nearly as wide. "Your words are wise. I will accept."

He places it into a flat pouch at his hip - and no shape distorts the pouch, as if it were merely a gateway to some larger place.</DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>He seems genuinely disappointed and regretful. "Truly, I wish I could allow this. But need I remind you that we struck a bargain? I told you repeatedly that I deal fairly, and so I do. And I insist that those with whom I deal treat me fairly as well. The Annulet, please."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>His face is cold and careful, calculating. "I have trusted your kind before, to my detriment. Yet there is something about you that speaks of honesty. Very well. I will trust your sincerity. Rest assured that if you try to cheat me, my vengeance will be terrible." The smile returns to his face. "Not that I need to threaten you, friend! As proof of my good nature, here is my portion of the bargain."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No!" he snaps in a sudden fury, almost shouting. "I have trusted castoffs before, to my great detriment. Always you come, cozening and wheedling, until at last you find a way to vanish and cheat me of my rightful payment." He points a finger at you, and you have a brief moment to realize his fingertip is a numenera device before agony washes over you. 

"Do not test my patience. Do not try my resolve. Give to me my Annulet."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gasps. "Oh my. My, my. This is quite a treasure. You found this in the lost anchorage? Discovered a connection for the lascars? How did they feel about the removal of this device?" He turns it over in his hands, and without returning it says, "I can offer a firm price of [Global: c4101_DracogenCortexReward] shins for this device."

She rose to her rank in the time-honored tradition of the Bloom, with bloody knife in hand. She rules in much the same way. Having seen some of the more 'legitimate' governments of the world, her way simply seems more honest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you still interested in exploring the Bloom, my friend? Word has reached these humble ears of a new Maw opening near the court of Gar-koto in Little Nihliesh. If it leads to the place I recall, which I thought long gone, it may contain devices of great value indeed. If I did not have pressing business here, I should explore it myself... but I forget myself. What can I help you with today?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am an investor. What is my business? I see you ask with your eyes, and so I answer for you - I deal in strange and exotic numenera. The Bloom is a crossroads, a fruitful place, and I see much of interest. My particular clientele demands items of an interesting nature, and they pay me well for it. Well enough that I can afford to pay my finders generously and remain... solvent." </DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I remain here because a great number of things and people emerge from this particular entrance into the Bloom. I am equipped to deal with them, my friend, and to help with their needs, for I have traveled far and know much of the world. If they prove hostile..." His smile turns dangerous. "I am equipped for that too. Perhaps you will see what I mean someday."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Quite some time, as ordinary humans measure it. I have made the Bloom my base of operations for a good hundred years. I have learned to avoid the political squabbles of its residents, for the political turns personal all too quickly. Personal and bloody."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks faintly offended. "By no means. I've traveled from the Clock of Kala to the Steadfast and seen the towering crystal skyfields. I have journeyed to the Forge of the Night Sky, dodging fire wights and spills of magma. I stood upon metal moons to look down upon the earth and saw signs of life in the stars nearby. I have traversed time and space, bending light around the Nebula Bell, and seen myself transmuted briefly into pure thought. The Bloom is but a small stop. Speak of something else."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I am looking for useful and interesting numenera, my friend. The Bloom is a crossroads of worlds, a place of power and pain, and a great many people from a great many places pass through here every day. I fund explorers, merchants, and other travelers who wish to bring back more for the collection, and I pay well."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>His voice lowers conspiratorially. "You heard none of this from me, of course. Let me summarize. Near the well, you'll find Skaydi, a small-time merchant. She seems different of late, though why I cannot say. In the fighting ring near her, you will see an aeons-old killing construct, Waits-for-prey. Avoid it unless you wish to die."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That, my friend, was one of the Decanted. They are servants of the nobles of the City of Glass - a nearly extinct people who value beauty and form. Had I known your interest, I might have suggested it speak to you. However, as I understand it, your body is artificially grown. They prefer their guests... organic."

He slashes his hand through the air, signifying the end of the discussion. "Let us speak of something else."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That was a silver orphan, my friend. The poor creatures roam this world - and perhaps others - in search of machine intelligences. They extrude tools and weapons from their bodies. They can provide tremendous value if given the proper incentive."</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>Dracogen looks pleased, rather than disgusted. "These are undigested pieces of the Bloom's victims - whether from here or from other dimensions, who can say? - that the Maws smash together into these putrid little curiosities. The Sundermuns are frequently interested in these balls... I provide the flesh, and they provide me with knowledge."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>Dracogen's toothy smile grows. "That was Sir Arthour, one of the preeminent collectors of information in the Ninth World. I had known him by reputation only, and I was pleased to make his acquaintance in person. He will provide a valuable contact indeed... assuming that he comes to no misadventure."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>His face is grim. "A jurulisk. Be glad that it did not manifest fully here, They are ultraterrestrials, ultradimensionals, monsters in form, shape, and line. They grow from small points, like dots on the surface of reality, and turn into lines. From there they develop more quickly, expanding to fill the space. They are aggressive, territorial, and incredibly dangerous."</DefaultText>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>His voice sharpens, and his gaze is intense. "You have agreed to my terms. Do you now tell me that you cannot fulfill your end of the bargain? I think not. You are resourceful."

He frowns. "I doubt the Trade Post is truly gone. You simply need to find another Maw that will take you there."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>He returns quickly, as if he had made arrangements well ahead of time. From what you know of Dracogen, this is not unlikely.

"The Memovira awaits you. She is eager to see you, in fact, though she is busy - quite busy. Speak to Brusca, at the fortress gate, and you will be allowed inside." 

He pauses. "Best of luck, friend. Should you come across any other interesting items, feel free to discuss them with me."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>He balks, suddenly recalcitrant. "This simply is not a worthwhile trade. Not for the Annulet. I would be willing to take it from you, to be sure. Again, my firm offer is [Global: c4101_DracogenCortexReward] shins, or the castoff Vicarian's Merecaster."

When Dracogen turns back to you, his ordinarily placid face is set into a terrifying predator's rictus. "You agreed to my terms, castoff. Give me the Annulet or you will wish for death. And then you *will* die. Return it. Now."</DefaultText>
