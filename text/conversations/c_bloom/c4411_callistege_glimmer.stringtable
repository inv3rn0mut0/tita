      <DefaultText>A faded, battered Callistege stands here. The Bloom's juices stain her clothes. As you approach, she turns and raises an eyebrow in mild surprise. Her voice is quiet and cracked, as if her screams had torn her vocal folds.

"Well. I thought I had seen the last of you, castoff."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You may recall that you convinced my sisters to sacrifice me to the Maw. I was eaten. My memories of that time are... are..." She puts her hand in front of her eyes. "Those memories are mine."

She lifts her chin defiantly. "And so in answer to your question, allow me to tell you in the most direct terms. I am being digested. My sisters sacrificed my life for their own amusement."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"Horrifying. it stripped away my sense of self and rebuilt me. I am the real Callistege - or *a* real Callistege, snatched away from my true world - but ... something is missing. I feel the lack, like a missing tooth, but I cannot tell you what is gone."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs softly. "I am still being eaten, castoff. I am still inside the Bloom. The experience is on-going."</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>The look of horror and contempt that crosses her face speaks volumes. "Never. It should tell you something that I would rather be devoured, with full knowledge that my mind will be subsumed into the Bloom - than to return to that life."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I am happy to be alone with my thoughts. I am overjoyed to have my privacy again in these last few moments of my life."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Why, I will stay here. I will consider my life, my actions, and my future. And in the meanwhile, no doubt, the Bloom will absorb more and more of me, until all that remains is willing to cast itself further into the Bloom. I will become a part of the Bloom. Immortality of a sort, I suppose."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I will remain here and let the Bloom decide."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We cannot feel your presence anymore, sister. But we can find a way to help you rejoin us. The knowledge you gained in your passage through the Maw... it could be invaluable to our understanding."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>The lone Callistege's voice is frigid. "You sacrificed me, and now you ask me to return to your... your *hive*? Gods, no. Despite knowing what the Bloom has taken from me, I am far more content here than I would be rejoined with all of *you*."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her laugh is a dangerous thing. "Are you certain that you are the same Callistege who was drawn in by the Bloom? Perhaps you're a ghost, excreted and stripped of our essential truth. No true Callistege would refuse to contribute to our knowledge."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah, comparing me to feces. Well played, sister." She leans in. "Is it so difficult for you to believe that I choose not to continue in your mad, desperate, foolish quest for immortality? The Bloom may have taken many aspects of our life away from me, but I remember well the belief that you have a great destiny. You and the other schemers who echo through realities - you commit atrocities and justify them in the name of your destiny. Well. I choose not to participate. I would rather rot here."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>She reels back as if slapped, and color rises in her cheeks. "Then rot here, pretender, and imagine that you have uncovered great meaning in your sacrifice. But know this - we will not remember you, and will not mourn you, and we will not *miss* you."

She turns imperiously away from her sister. "Ask your questions of this thing, castoff, and then let us move along."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Do not return to me. Please."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>She takes your elbow as her dissipated echo turns away. "Come, castoff, I would have some words."

She leans in close. "I find myself in a difficult situation. I am unaccustomed to opening myself to others, but... I require reassurance when faced with an argument presented by myself. Am I - are we - truly as terrible as she claims? Are we truly monstrous?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She's not entirely wrong. The memories she recited when the Maw took her - they were heinous."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't think so, Callistege. You have made choices, but I support your actions. They advanced your knowledge."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The worth of your life can only be measured at its end. You decide what to do in the meantime."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We don't have time for your crisis of conscience. Let's go."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A worthless platitude. Do you think I have never considered this? I asked for your opinion on my actions, and... well. I suppose you have offered it sufficiently. You have no opinion. I understand."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sags imperceptibly. "That is... that is a relief to hear, my friend. I find that I value your opinion more the longer we associate. For my part, I shall endeavor to make my choices worthwhile."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sighs. "Don't patronize me, castoff. Our relationship has been, at best, a bumpy one. At least you have not resorted to outright insults. Yet."

She smiles thinly. "But perhaps this is your way of trying to improve our travels. I commend the effort, for what it's worth."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her many faces register shock. "Then why... why do you continue to travel with me if you think so poorly of me?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her tone is sour. "I'm unsurprised that you think so. Perhaps we can find a mutually agreeable time to part."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>

      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I... I see. Then let us hope that I remain useful, so that you do not cast me to the wayside."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>She turns away, but not before you see a tear welling in her eye. "I appreciate your faith in me," she whispers. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>She scoffs. "You were among those who resented being drawn into our particular nexus in the first place. I am unsurprised by your answer. We are stronger without you anyway."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head, a rueful smile playing about the corners of her mouth. "Then we are useful to each other. You provide assistance, and I provide... amusement. I shall endeavor to reach my goals, if only to offer you satisfaction."

She sighs.</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was the luck of the draw, sister. I don't recall you objecting as we decided whether or not to offer one of us."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You must feel some measure of guilt in the matter. Did you think I condemned the choice? I merely offered an observation. *I* was prepared to be amused. It was just my ill luck that I became the butt of the joke."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>She smiles. "I appreciate that, dear. So few understand the sacrifices I have made."</DefaultText>

      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There is a Maw here that feeds on despair. If you offered yourself to it, you might find peace."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>She stares at you coldly. "This isn't *despair*, you idiot. This is a realistic view of the world and my life. This is *acceptance*." She flaps a hand at you. "Go peddle your nonsense elsewhere."</DefaultText>
