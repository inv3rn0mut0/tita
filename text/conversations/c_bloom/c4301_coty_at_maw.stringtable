      <DefaultText>Coty's hair is matted in sweat. He flinches back as the maw's fleshy tendrils stretch toward him. They are obviously interested.

"A-are you sure it won't kill me?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Coty sets his chin. He takes one step forward and stops. Half to you and half to himself, he says, "If I live, I go free. No one can touch me then."

He walks closer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Cassandra?" Tears pour down his face. The maw laps them up greedily. "No, don't go in the harbor. It was a joke. Stop!"

The tongues wrap around him, hungry and aggressive. If they're hurting him, he doesn't seem to notice. His attention is fixed somewhere else. "Stop! Stop!" he sobs. "I'm coming, Cassie! I'll save you!"

He struggles against the tendrils, but you get the impression he's not trying to escape.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Several moments pass where the only sound is Coty's weeping.

Then a new tone rises: his cracked, hollow sobs come sharper, more quickly, eventually shaping themselves into laughter. He turns back to you - his face a wet mess of tears and Bloom slime - but for the first time since you met him, he's smiling.

"I'm free," he croaks. "Thank you." He pushes himself up, unsteady but certain. "Thank you," he says again and walks away into his new life.

Silently, the Maw opens behind him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yeah." He nods a little too fast. "Yeah, I'm sure."

{GEORGE/COLIN: I'm a little surprised that Rhin has nothing to say in this conversation. She seemed to be pretty invested in Coty in his courtyard dialogs.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"NO!" he screams. He reaches out suddenly, then claws at the tendrils that hold him fast. This time you think he's really aware of them. He's really trying to get out.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Bloom's tongues hold him tight. One of them lashes at you, stinging your hand.

      <DefaultText>He screams, long and loud. Then gradually his screams turn to sobs. He no longer claws at the tendrils. He clutches them like a lover's tender arms. "I didn't mean it," he says, his words barely audible through his tears. "Sis, you gotta know, I didn't mean for you to die. I just wanted to... I was stupid. I just want you back now. I want it all back. COME BACK!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He collapses to his knees, cradling one of the tendrils as though it were a child. He shouts at the roof until his face is crimson and he's out of breath. He screams five more times, then buries his face in the tendril on his lap and cries.

Slowly, gently the tongues retract. As the last one recedes, Coty stretches out his hand, </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tendrils lash out, grabbing him by the arms, the legs, the head. They pull him closer. He cries out as they penetrate his skin, then his eyes focus on something distant, something you can't see.</DefaultText>
