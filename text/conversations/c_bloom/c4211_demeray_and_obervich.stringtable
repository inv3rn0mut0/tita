      <DefaultText>"Why, good sir! Greetings, greetings, and welcome to our little... *operation*!" His long face suffuses with a smile at his joke. His sagging skin and the dark bags under his eyes speak of a deep physical weariness, but his manner is bright and cheery. He wipes his nose on a filthy sleeve and extends his hand. "My name is Doctor Demeray!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His partner steps forward as well. "And I'm Doctor Obervich!" He extends his hand. "It's probably best to grasp the top one." Like his partner, his face is long and seamed. Unlike his partner, each of his arms is bifurcated at the elbow, with a mechanical forearm and hand grafted to them. A multitude of prosthetic eyes are drilled into the top of his head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Without eyes? Were they destroyed, or is this inherited? Was this a creature that has no visual cortex?" He waves his hands. "It makes no matter. I can restore sight to any living creature." He leans forward and taps your chest. "*Any*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Obervich is nodding and smiling, and prepares to offer a boast himself, but as he holds up his strange arm, his index fingers in the air, he pauses and says quietly, "Do you mean restoring sight *and* retaining independent nervous autonomy? That is, without scooping out portions of the brain?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear." He paces a very small circle. "I know only one procedure that meets the specific qualification that she retain all her faculties, I'm afraid. It is long work. Long, hard work. Long, hard, *expensive* work." He glances at Obervich.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The half-man returns his partner's quick look. "It would require compensation worth more than coin. Perhaps if you found us an interesting test subject for investigation, we could consider a fair trade. And when I say 'perhaps' and 'could', I actually mean that it would suffice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His head starts bobbing up and down before you're finished speaking. "Oh yes. So very *much* yes. We would be particularly interested in investigating this tattoo on your head. It seems reactive and strange."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We have seen others with this kind of tattoo, and have tried to recruit some of them. Some have been less than willing, and we have had some unpleasant feedback loops from others. I'm delighted to know that you come to us voluntarily."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The first order of business is an injection. Your consciousness swims into a dreamy half-haze, objects taking on a luminous, rainbow-tinted beauty. A sense of great satisfaction fills you, a rush of pleasure through your veins. Even when Obervich leans over you with a scalpel and begins to cut, you feel only a slight tugging... and the bead of your blood stuck to the edge of the scalpel makes you want to weep for its transient beauty.

Eventually you drift into darkness.

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>A distant thunder summons you back to consciousness. Your eyes blink blearily open, and you see Demeray's face peering into your own. You feel as though you have been torn open, your mind stripped, and something indefinable snatched away. A sense of loss pervades your being.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns to Aligern. "Those tattoos on this older gentleman are something, I must say. Look at the way they writhe! Obervich, are you seeing this? Oh my, yes. This gentleman would make an excellent subject to expand our horizons."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He recoils when he looks at Matkina. "Ah, no. She is unsuitable, quite unsuitable. I had the opportunity to interview her once before, and discovered that she has some latent ability to blind people. Additionally, she is not cooperative."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>He touches Riastrad. "Ah, the enforcer in the living armor. We've already examined silver orphans and have developed some theories about their control of metal. We don't need to explore those theories just yet."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>He holds his hands near Oom's center of mass. "Oh my. Oh... *my*. This is truly fascinating. Is the thing psychically reactive? How does it learn? It seems to have formed a bond with you, but without a visible sensory apparatus... no, wait, is its entire *skin* a sensing organ? Oh, this one will do nicely."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He reaches for Erritis. "A pale boy? No, I don't think... wait a moment... *wait a moment*... this golden cloud, do you know what it does, lad? Are you aware of - " he stops talking, aware that Erritis is simply staring at him. "This boy will be an excellent subject."</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah, yes. Ahem. We've already had some exposure to our former colleague, Callistege. We've had our researches and our hypotheses, and so far have turned up nothing. We'd love the chance to expand our knowledge."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>He lifts his eyes to Tybir. "A sellsword past his prime? Does he do any tricks? Have any hidden talents? Does he perhaps gout purple flame from his rear?" Obervich's eyes click through a number of different foci and filters, and he frowns. "No. Just an ordinary man. No, not suitable."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His gaze rests on Rhin for several moments. Suddenly he shakes his head and looks away. "No," he murmurs. "She is not suitable. Leave her be."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Oom shrinks in on itself, and extrudes thorns as the duo close in on it.</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Me? You're going to give me to these butchers? Not if I've anything to sa-" He whirls on Demeray, who is sneaking up behind him, and sticks his finger in the chiurgeon's face.

"Not another step, quack, or you'll find out what these tattoos can do firsthand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It prepares to lash out at Demeray, and with remarkable speed Obervich sprays it with some sort of aerosol. Whatever was in the spray instantly destroys Oom's defenses, and Oom loses shape and collapses in a puddle on the floor. The two doctors scoop it up carefully and carry it to the table for careful examination.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Demeray sighs and sprays Aligern in the face with some sort of aerosol. The big man drops as if he'd been paralyzed. The two chiurgeons load him up and drag him to the table for his examination.</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Err... I suppose it *could* happen, but I make no promises." 

The doctors make encouraging noises to Erritis, soothing sounds that calm his nerves as they lead him into a side room. Demeray pulls a white curtain closed.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>At last they are finished, and Demeray reveals the table on which Oom sits. The little blob is quiescent until you approach, with none of the signs of personality that marked its character.

"A success!" Demeray announces. "Patient #28 was an admirable client, and should make a full recov-" He pauses and looks at Oom carefully. "Should mostly recover relatively quickly."</DefaultText>

      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah, my good colleague has forgotten to tell you, but you may experience dizziness, nausea, some bleeding for a short time. Nothing to be concerned with!" He clears his throat. "We've uncovered some interesting facts about your tattoo, if you'd like to hear them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So in order to help an acquaintance regain her sight, I need to provide a test subject?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, yes indeed! We always need good test subjects, and those who provide *interesting* research opportunities are few in number."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"These days, more so than most. It is the cruel irony of finding a place with so much potential, so far from the prying eyes of meddling do-gooders, and with such rich potential for otherworldly visitors... and with so few actually worthy of our time."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>Demeray nods respectfully to you. "No worries! We'll have him back and better than... We'll have him back shortly!"

He shoos you away.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>At last they are finished and you can see Aligern sitting on a table spattered with blood. He raises his face slowly to you, and his eyes look low and empty.

"What a surprise!" Demeray announces. "Patient #28 was (note to self) initially difficult, but we were able to sedate him successfully and complete our investigation."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Quite exciting indeed! This was a well-chosen subject, no doubt. Thank you so much for the opportunity!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Err... I suppose it *could* happen, but I make no promises." 

The doctors make encouraging noises to Erritis, soothing sounds that calm his nerves as they lead him away. Demeray pulls a white curtain around them.

A high-pitched buzzing emanates from the operating area, and then a strong golden pulse, like a heartbeat, fills the small room. Hours pass, and the glow dims.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>At last, Demeray steps out to greet you. Behind him, you see Erritis sitting on a long table. The glow around Erritis is patchy and flaking, rather than a robust shine. He looks drained.

Demeray's dirty coat is slightly dirtier than before, and a sheen of sweat covers his forehead. His eyes are aglow, however.

"Fantastic. Just fantastic. Your cohort was an excellent subject. We hardly dug around inside him at all, so he should recover quickly."</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh *my*, yes. We've studied Patients #28 through 13492928512 (that's 28 to the 7th power, and we will probably file them under #28 for easier reference), but lost track of the patients because they keep co-joining and separating. Your friend performed splendidly. I hope you don't mind, but we took a small sample to investigate more thoroughly. At any rate, I'm sure you'll want to be off." He stands expectantly, waiting for you to leave.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>He turns his multi-eyed gaze to you. "Of course, of course. But first... Callistege, we have prepared this injection for you. Remove the Attractor, use this, and it will seal off your mind. Permanently, I'm afraid - you will lose your *fascinating* status as a potential hive-mind."

    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yet not one answer for my possibilities. You've had years, and we fracture through time. My sisters' voices grow louder, and I grow louder in their minds as well.

      <DefaultText>"Our apologies, Callistege. We'll begin a new course of study shortly." A hint of steel creeps into his voice. "We can't change the past - at least, not yet - so that will have to suffice." His warm tones return. "Now, what can we do for you, traveler?"</DefaultText>

Our local Maw devoured him and then spat him out a year later without his skin, muscle, or memory. Yet if you look at him, you can see that he has both skin *and* muscle. Granted, it's *human* skin and muscle, but that's all we had to work with."

      <DefaultText>"The Bloom devours more than flesh and bone. It is hyper-aware, hyper-sentient, and its needs are still beyond our knowledge. We do know that it sometimes feeds on certain mental states, and that certain psychic wavelengths attract its attention. I theorize that it nourishes itself on those wavelengths. This is most likely what happened to Jont. His *essence*, if you will, has been absorbed and probably excreted by now. There is no recovery from that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The place is a charnel house. Aligern, lying in repose with his tattoos writhing energetically, is covered with blood, but very little of it seems to be his own. Most of it seems to belong to the two doctors on the floor, who have been torn apart. But by whom or what? There is no one else in this area but Aligern, and no other entrance.
