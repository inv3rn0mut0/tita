      <DefaultText>The small pile of components beside the lascar seems to have grown. His repairs are apparently not going well. 

He spots you looking and cradles his eyes with a greasy hand. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He squints at your mouth, then nods. 

"I fix." He snorts. "Try fix."

He chuckles at himself again. "Not fix."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He plants one hand on a set of controls. "Is give information on stars." He drops his hand on the other set. "Is listen to the stars. For voices. For Home."

He stands straighter. "When Ship comes, Ship speaks." He waves a hand in a motion you recognize as a 'this isn't really what I mean but I can't remember the words' gesture. 

"I hear first. Tell all. Me." He smacks his chest with an open hand, grinning.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He pauses, his hands slipping from his chest, and indicates a small section of the controls he didn't touch before. 

"Is for Cortex maintenance," he says dismissively. Apparently, his job doesn't cover that area of the Anchorage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He follows your gaze and shakes his head. 

"Is broken in..." he makes a complicated, gearlike motion with both hands before giving up. "In everywhere. We, all of we, are for fighting. Fixing? No. Genjes can fix, but behind room is no... critical. He say..."

He points at himself and deepens his voice. "'You. Fix.'" He points to the sign on the door. "Made sign. Made sign and *ula*." He throws his hands up in the air. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His smile widens. You get a feeling that people don't usually take that much of an interest in this man's work. 

"Genjes does most. Me? Wait for light *here*," he points, "and then press button *here*."

He chuckles at himself. "Is difficult work. Need concentrate." He makes a furious show of concentrating on the light and pressing the button with a finger. He chuckles again, then shrugs. 

"Without button? No remove Cortex. So... is important, button."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This lascar examines the contents of an open hatch in the console before him, brow contorted. Occasionally, he takes a tiny component from the tidy pile beside him and plugs it into the machine's unseen innards, waits a hopeful moment, and mutters what is most likely a curse. 

He spots you and gives you the rueful grin of unsuccessful repairmen everywhere. </DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>The smile on the lascar's face falters a little, but he shrugs. 

"Yes. Use controls here when you want." he says, pointing. "Not others, please."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hello. Is good. Good to... " he chews his lip, thinking. "Good to come."

He watches your expression carefully, then sighs and touches his forehead. Then his lips. And he shakes his head. 

"Speak slow, please. I hear. I try."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"For me? I wait here." He points at his feet. "Genjes does work. When work is done, light show here." He points. "And? Push button."

He mimes pushing the button next to the dark screen.</DefaultText>
