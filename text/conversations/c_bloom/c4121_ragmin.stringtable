      <DefaultText>Jagged antlers twist from this blue-skinned mutant's temples. Permanent creases shape his face, revealing a history of scowls and grimaces.

His glance slices past you to Tybir... and then to the ring on Tybir's hand. He tenses.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I had a feeling you were comin' for me sooner or later," he says, lips twisting. "I never shoulda put that ring on."

His twisted hand creeps towards a crude dagger on his belt. "Bullyin' a little girl wasn't enough for you, yeah? You want to finish the work your friend started?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tybir looks at his hand, then to you, confused. 

You turn your attention back to the mutant.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That his name? No, I ain't." He drops his hand back to his side. "I'm a thief, and I ain't nothin' like what people would call a nice man, but I ain't no 'Auvigne' either."

He spits on the ground. </DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You?" he says, his hand freezing. "No, not you. But your tall friend did, and I know a dozen dead-eyed killers who wouldn't have done the same." He spits on the ground. 

"But maybe you didn't know what he did. Maybe you're just here to clean up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He raises his palms, sneering. 

"Fine, fine. But you can't blame a man for lookin' after his daughter. Your friend left her *weepin'*."</DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's like this. Kelsie has these headaches like I did at her age. The only thing that helped her sleep was that singing wall."

He looks between your blank faces, and his brow furrows. "There was somethin' buried in it. Sounded like voices hummin' together." His expression darkens. "And a few weeks back, your man came in, put her to the side, knocked a hole in the wall, and took the thing out." 

He scowls. "She *begged* him to leave it. And he ignored her, and took her singing wall away."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No," Tybir snarls, turning on the mutant. "You're lying. Auvigne wouldn't do that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But the mutant is staring at Tybir, troubled. </DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He's a good man," Tybir continues, baring his teeth. "Better than this world deserves. So you're going to tell me the truth, and tell me *now*."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I ain't lying! After I came home and found Kelsie weepin', I went after your man. Caught him alone, and maybe he saw my daughter in me, because he told me he was sorry, an' that he took her music away because he was doing dirty work to help a friend."

He eyes Tybir. "Not that *that* excuses anythin', but he might have been tellin' the truth. After I put the ring on, I heard laughin'. It's why I dropped it - couldn't stand the feel of that voice in my head."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And he, what, gave you the ring as compensation?" Tybir says, hands balled into fists. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mutant blinks. 

"No. I took it off his hand before I dumped the body," he says.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You killed him?" he screams, murder in his eyes. "You worthless sack of meat?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That doesn't make his life worth a damn thing," Tybir says, avoiding your gaze. "I should know."

But something flickers in his eyes.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>You hurl yourself against Tybir, holding him back from the cowering mutant. Slowly, you feel the rage drain from Tybir until he sags in your arms. 

Then, with firm, calmer hands, he pushes you away and turns his back on the mutant, who flees immediately. "I want to have *words* with Dracogen, and soon."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hurl yourself against Tybir, but in his rage, his strength surpasses yours. He pushes you to the side and lunges at the mutant. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ragmin stumbles, falls, and raises his hands to plead for his life. Tybir reaches past them and snaps the mutant's neck. </DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tybir falters, and casts a hateful look at you. 

"You're right," he says. Tears spill down his cheeks. "Damn you."

He turns from the mutant, who flees immediately. "I want to have *words* with Dracogen, and soon."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There," Tybir pants, fingers flexing. "Now, let's go have words with Dracogen."</DefaultText>
