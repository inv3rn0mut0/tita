      <DefaultText>This wiry young man wears drit-stained, ragged clothes and carries a wicked, jagged knife. Wet blood still stains its blade, though you see no evidence of bodies or victims. He sees you, and his mouth works in an instinctive but passionless snarl.

As his gaze shifts away, he sighs deeply. His voice is flat, affectless. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dakore looks at you and waves the blade half-heartedly, as if he were threatening you instinctively but can't be bothered to make it mean something, and his voice is as flat as before. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I mean..." He thinks deeply, apparently unaware of the answer, as if he has been going through the motions for so long that he can't recall the reasons for them. "Yes? I could threaten you. More than that. I could push you to the ground and chop you apart like all the others."

His fingers tighten over his dagger, but there are tears in his eyes now. The tears of a lost child. "But it wouldn't matter, would it? Not anymore."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his blade, looking at the ground, at the wall, anywhere but at you. "I kill. Kill people. I protect my territory." He whispers, "They feared me. The places where I walked, where I marked, they *feared* me."

He trails off, muttering to himself. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks at the empty pool, at your way down, and a spark of life enters his eyes for the first time since you've seen him. "There's a way, yes. It's down your rope." He licks his lips. "I'm not such a fool that I'd take your route unasked."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You've emptied the pool. The drain lies open." He swallows, and you can see the fear in his face. "But what waits at the bottom? What fears lie unconquered there?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The one will devour you, and who can say where you'll wind up? The other... I'd not touch its effluvient, though I've drunk of it when desperate. It gives pain and visions, and it makes you less. But if you stand near the pool, you can hear the beating of a great heart, and the fluid gurgle and chuckle and spill into it with countless liters... but it doesn't overflow. It drains into some other chamber, you see. It *must*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So listen. In this place of devouring, this final stop before entering the belly of the Bloom, the Bloom can call our desires from our memories, twist those personalities to serve itself. Whether they're real figments or figments of reality that the Bloom brings through, I can't say. But they're *twisted*, I said, and so I say. Now you know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks away. "Another truth: I can't... I can't leave. What's on the other side? Is it worse than this?" He pauses. "Tell no one you spoke with me. I'd have them think me vanished into myth, not cowering on the edge of death." He swallows again. "If they remember me at all."

He turns away from you, and says, "You won't see me again. You have the freedom of my territory."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I came to the Bloom to kill an old friend. I followed him deep into the vast and winding ways of this fell beast. He led me through a narrow vein and then," he shivers, gritting his teeth. "A Maw took me. Bit down. Chewed and chewed."

He looks around. "And this is how Dakore dies. Not at the hands of a mob, or on the end of a levy's blade, no." He chuckles. Or sobs. "In the gullet of the Bloom. The biggest predator of them all."</DefaultText>
