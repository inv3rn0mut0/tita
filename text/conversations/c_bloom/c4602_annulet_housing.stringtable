      <DefaultText>Nestled among the crystal formations is a steel pod. Cables pass in and out of the pod, glowing with energy.

As soon as you're within arm's reach, a shining interface materializes in the air between you and the pod. There are a few strange symbols arranged in a circle around a filigreed pentagon similar to the tattoo on your head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you draw closer, the filigreed pentagon glows more brightly. Your head becomes warm, but not uncomfortably so. When it touches the light, you feel a small amount of energy flow out from you. The cables on the pod pulse quickly, and the top of the chamber opens with a hiss.

The only item inside is a hyaline circlet, as black as the sky behind the stars - the Magmatic Annulet. You remove it from the pod and take it with you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Now that it's empty, the pod has sealed itself shut. The shining interface no longer appears when you're nearby.</DefaultText>
