      <DefaultText>This filthy old man is dressed in a motley of rags, arranged artfully to emphasize the inhuman reach of his needle-like fingers and the two protruding humps on his back, as if his mutations are a source of pride. He wears smoked goggles on his forehead, parked above his transparent eyelids and his noseless face. His teeth are small, even, and shining white - he shows them often as he smiles to himself. 

His pockets are filled with trinkets and baubles that he has picked from the piles of trash.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ai-ee, ah-heh!" Crimper looks extremely agitated. His transparent eyes are open with fear. "A voice, I hear a voice. Deep in the pile there, down past the place where I have dug. But a woman's voice calls out." His sharp fingers wrap around your arm. "Tell me you hear it." Then he lets go of your arm and looks back at the piled trash.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah-heh! This is the midden for the Bloom, to be sure! I've crossed through many chambers and cavities, and none of them have this kind of refuse. We mutants do not make this much mess, and new piles of garbage appear daily. So much work, ah-heh-heh!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He lowers his head and grumbles, "Ai-yeh, what does it look like I'm doing? I dig, and I answer questions for fools. Not everything in a trash heap is trash, but wastrels abound. Why waste? Why waste indeed. Feh." He combs through a mound of trash with uncanny speed and precision.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His tone instantly softens, sounding almost *pleased*. "Oh! Yeh, people lose all kinds of treasures in the trash." He sits back and pushes up his goggles. "Unexploded detonations. Blocks of metal that spark and steam with nano spirit swarms. A marble with a cloud of insects inside. Half-used healing injectors." He beams. "A colloxtrian azvail, even! That brought me many shins."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ai-yeh-heh-heh! It was this!" He fumbles around in his pockets, slapping at his shapeless rags, before he reaches a hidden stash and pulls something out. It's an ugly, vomit-green cylinder made of organic material, about half the size of a forearm, covered in knots and whorls and tendrils. It looks like it might still be alive.

"I found this a year ago. It was buried near Gar-koto's tank, and I would have missed it if it hadn't wriggled. Listen!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As Crimper looks away, you dip your fingers into the wide pocket where he dropped the music box. Your fingers close around something wet, and it grunts just a bit as you snatch it free. 

You stash the musical... log... away before he looks back at you.

      <DefaultText>Crimper turns just as your hand grasps the musical log in his pocket. You've been caught! You're stronger and faster than the old mutant, but he fights tenaciously. His needle-fingers dig into your wrist, and you involuntarily release the warty little device.

You drop it, and it falls to the ground, bursting open with a meaty splat. Crimper cries aloud. "You thieving bastard! An old man's pleasure destroyed! You should have your eyes stabbed and your guts winched free!"

He shuffles away, sobbing to himself.</DefaultText>

He searches his pockets, his movements faster and more desperate as he fails to turn it up. "No, no, no! Where- where is it? Did I lose it? Ai-yeh, no! No!" Tears begin to well up behind his transparent lids, and he quickly lowers his smoked goggles so that you can't see him cry.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah-eh! Good, good! The first possession in your hands should be *on* your hands. A trash-picker needs gloves or skin like synth - stone, glass, and ordure combine in these piles, and like as not some sharps will pierce your skin.

Must be the child is beyond dead now, and has no business on this earthly plane." He turns back to you. "Ai-yeh, I'd not ask you to suffer such indignities as trash-picking.

      <DefaultText>"You mean the colloxtrian azvail? Heh. Most your age don't catch such things. It was a simple sonic emitter, but it had the power to twist thoughts and change perceptions. Ai-yeh, and once I found a vial of spraying energy armor." He frowns. "By the time I knew what it was, the light of the breastplate had melted away and the vial was empty." He brightens again. "But treasures! Such treasure!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He continues in that vein for a time, leading you to various trash piles. "This one, picked clean. See how the pile is strewn and be-holed? A pile of last resort. You want those relatively undisturbed..."

You spend some time looking for newer piles, and you're rewarded with the pleasure of sifting through some organic goop and chemical-scented tailings. But eventually you find something that may be useful, and you pocket it.

      <DefaultText>"Now over here, ah-heh, the others hit the pile quick but not deep. You want to go deeper than the surface, ayeh, but you need to go fast and careful..."

He shows you how to dig through a larger pile quickly and safely, maneuvering around jagged chunks of broken synth, shattered stronglass, and splintered wood. 

At the end, you find an interesting piece, and you take that, too.

      <DefaultText>He squeezes it and sets it down, and the thing begins to sing in a slow, discordant tone. The device shivers and rolls around on the ground, hooting and piping through tiny mouths in its tendrils and whorls, and then issues a melancholy belch. The mouths close, and the thing ceases its movement and sound.

He titters a bit. "I laugh every time. I had to shed blood for this one, ai-yeh. Some human thought to take it from me."

He drops it into one of his outer pockets.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you examine the oozing remains of the strange device, you notice another, smaller device that was apparently hidden inside - or perhaps was part of its inner workings. You glance around to make sure the old mutant has truly left, then pocket the mysterious treasure.
