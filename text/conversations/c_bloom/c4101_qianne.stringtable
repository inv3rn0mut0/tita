      <DefaultText>A truly staggering quantity of filth covers this woman like a rind, holding the tattered remains of a once-lavish party dress together. Matted platinum blonde hair obscures her hollow face, wary eyes peering around suspiciously. Yet despite it all, this bedraggled creature exudes a sense of poise, even dignity.

She's muttering venemously at no one in particular, something about "brigands" and "swine" and "twice this week."

      <DefaultText>A skinny woman in the tattered ruin of an evening gown huddles by the twisted wreck, near a partially collapsed shelter of synth panels. Everything from her white-blonde hair  down to her single high-heeled shoe is coated in the most spectacular layer of filth you've ever seen, along with countless welts and bruises.

This was one of the latter kind, a 'transdimensional transport.' It could get from Stirdahl to the Bloom in just a few hours. That trek would take months on foot. Maybe years."</DefaultText>
