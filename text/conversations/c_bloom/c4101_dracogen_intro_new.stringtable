      <DefaultText>"I once had claim to an artifact, but it was spirited away to a place called the Ascension of Kex-Lianish - a realm of crystalline beauty. I need that artifact back. It's called the Magmatic Annulet, a circlet of dark, hyaline material. It is of great interest to me. *Great* interest. I believe that you may be uniquely suited to retrieve it."

      <DefaultText>"Your compatriots in Miel Avest wanted to keep the Merecasters away from the Sorrow, and what better place to do it than the Bloom? As a hyperdimensional creature of incredible psychic energy, it's completely capable of holding the Sorrow at bay. For a time, anyway. I arranged a meeting with the Memovira, who was eager for the influx of funds, and she agreed to lock the Merecasters away." He stops speaking for a moment.

      <DefaultText>He taps his chin. "This does present a problem, then. Auvigne pledged a year of service to me for certain services, and... well, now he's vanished."

"I thought of using the paired mind-link ring you gave me as collateral in order to track him down, but then realized that *anything* could have befallen the poor man here in the Bloom... and besides, who am I to stand between two long-lost lovers?

      <DefaultText>"Ahh, but we do. Your friend here had a partner named Auvigne." He pauses, considering. "No. Not a partner. A lover. And theirs was truly a great love.
