      <DefaultText>This woman's blocky face seems to be frozen in a permanent sneer of disdain. Her hair is savagely shorn, her apron spattered with blood. In front of her, a makeshift operating table is covered in dirt and crusted fluids. Her tools are sharp knives, syringes, and other more exotic devices that look none too clean.</DefaultText>

She cackles and turns away.

      <DefaultText>She stares at you, her mouth slightly open, and she remains that way for a good minute. She snaps back to reality and looks down at her hands. Disgust dawns over her features as she considers what she is doing, and she throws down her tools.

She turns and vomits.

"Oh, no. No, no no. The Bloom whispered to me, and I listened. What have I done?" She rushes away, leaving her tools behind.

The ground rumbles under your feet, and you feel a wave of malice from the Bloom-flesh.
