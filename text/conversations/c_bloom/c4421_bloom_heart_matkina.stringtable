      <DefaultText>"So I've been giving this some thought. If the Bloom is psychically attuned, it should be vulnerable to psychic attacks, yes? And our sire's uninentional *gift* to us - the ability to focus the Tides - it's both a physical and a psychic curse."

She shrugs.</DefaultText>

"Look, your control of the Tides is about as good as mine, but it's more *effective*. Especially against something like this."

      <DefaultText>Matkina beckons you. On her normally impassive face, you can see the tiniest hint of concern."The Bloom is a predator, yes? And ultimately, it feeds on pain. We give pain, you and I, but your paincasting is more effective in a situation like this. Unfortunately, you haven't learned even the slightest control over it. That presents a problem, in a number of ways."

      <DefaultText>She leans in close to you: "My point is, it was too easy to get here. We're in the guts of the Bloom now, and we're going to walk into these innermost ... tongues... without a fight? So you need to be on your guard. Mentally. You need to plan this."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you could channel your Tides into those tongues, you might be able to bend them to your will. But it's going to take a lot of focus, and a lot of fortitude to resist what they're going to do to you."</DefaultText>
