      <DefaultText>He laughs, the sound like a saw on steel. "I know that Maw. I know its desire. And look! Its meal sits nearby, quaffing poison all day, as if the toxins numb the knowledge of the Maw's desire. Even that - " and his voice drops to a whisper, " - even that drunken fool knows that it calls to him." His voice returns to its normal, grating register. "It is a good day when it happens."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gestures in the direction of the soldiers. "Do you see that Maw beyond them? The tongues there, they once seek me out, and I, bedazzled by them, give myself to their taste." He shrugs, sending a ripple through his loose-fitting skin. "I awake... sometime later. Agony is my lot." He nods solemnly. "The Maw has stripped my skin and stolen my muscles. It has eaten my memories. I do not recall who I am before or where I come from, or even my own appearance. All I know is pain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But they cannot save my memory. The Bloom is sated on me, my thoughts and dreams and other things caught up in its fabric." He shrugs. "I am content."</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks carefully at the soldiers, probably to be certain they aren't listening. "Perhaps your interest piques when I tell you that murdens from Old Slave Block raid this place some days ago. They steal the soldiers' standard... their flag of battle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And if someone wants to have their captain owe him a favor? Return his standard.  This makes the proud soldier a slave for a moment. A person could force him to a task or make him lose face with his troops."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I see you nod already. You know about the standard. And you know that if someone brings it to him, someone asks a favor of Artaglio? Someone makes a slave of the man for one request. Artaglio cannot refuse, not for the return of his standard." He nods, satisfied. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"These soldiers, do they ask you for coin when you enter? Do you not see how the Slump operates?" He gestures with his strangely-jointed arm. "Over there, the good chiurgeons, they pay half their earnings to these bullies. Sheen, there, brews new experiences for the soldiers as they grow bored. They say they are here for our protection, but they are truly here for our labor. They make slaves of us all so they can buy their poisons."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He whispers: "Angry men. Always drinking, always armed. Best to approach with caution. Smile, hands open." He opens his mouth, and then snaps it shut. "But to speak nothing is my policy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I tell you. It is better not to ask. Listen." His skin sags, and you hear air hiss from him like a deflating bladder. A ripe and foul gas envelops you. "Smile." His grin is inhuman, and his hands bend the wrong way. "Hands... open."

Then horror fills his eyes. "Ah! Many apologies. Nervous reaction. Instinctive?" He shakes his head, and his skin inflates as he does. "Perhaps some memory returns, some day. That day is not now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The skin of this broad-shouldered man looks blotchy, even patchwork. It slumps from his frame as if he had lost a great deal of weight. He bobs his bald head in greeting as you approach, and his neck moves like it's broken. Yet he seems to be in no pain, and his movements are quick and assured. His voice is sonorous but fluting, with a strange buzz that grates on your nerves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You can't help but notice that his gaze continues to steal over toward the band of soldiers gathered around the cask. The muscles of his face twitch and bob as he does so.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If the good chiurgeons, Demeray and Obervich, are not watching, I am dead. They give me new muscles they make themselves. They grow me new skin made from dead men and sew it on. They cannot match old frame perfectly, but they tell me I am fascinating case. Not human." He pulls at some of the loose skin, oblivious to how painful it seems. "No longer visitant, yes? Now a resident."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Maw. It eats my memories, my muscles, my skin. The doctors save me, sew on new skin, almost - as you say - good as new. Skin is that of dead men, grown in vat. My memories, my life before, all gone, but I am content now. Mostly content."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"These soldiers, they say they protect, but do they improve the Slump or impoverish?" He shakes his head - an unnerving, fluid motion. "They own our labor. We are slaves all, so they can afford to drink and to forget. But perhaps your interest piques when I tell you that murdens from Old Slave Block raid and steal their standard?"</DefaultText>
