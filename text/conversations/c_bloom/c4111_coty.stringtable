      <DefaultText>Coty works diligently at Sundermun's bench. He's not quite as in step with the merchant as the younger Sundermun is - he misunderstands things and bumps into them on occasion - but the items he strings together are of at least the same quality, if not better.

"Hey!" He looks up with a light in his eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I made something for you." He beams proudly as he hands it to you. "I know it's not much, considering everything you did for me, but, well... I had to do *something*."

      <DefaultText>He smiles shyly. "Listen, I'm really grateful for what you've done for me, so I'm working on something on the side. Come back again some time, and I'll give it to you when I'm finished."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I didn't think I would, but I do. Mister Sundermun even thinks I could start my own stand when I'm older - farther away, of course." He glances warily at the elder Sundermun.

      <DefaultText>He leans in closer. "There's something weird about these two, though. Have you noticed they're almost exactly alike? Not like family, I mean. *Exactly*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You mean...?" Coty looks back and forth between the Sundermuns, his eyes growing wider with each turn of his neck.

Suddenly he stops and holds his head in his hands. "I don't know what you mean. My head hurts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm glad we found any job at all. There's not much he's good at."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's... all right. I admit, some nights I'm afraid to sleep because of the nightmares." You notice some of the old sobriety in his eyes.

"But, you know? The work keeps me busy, so I don't think about it as much. And making things, sometimes serving people - it feels like I'm a bit cleaner, in a way. Not that I've paid for what I did - or ever will - but like... like maybe it doesn't matter as much as I felt it did."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rhin blushes and pulls away, but not before giving your hand a small squeeze.

      <DefaultText>"I agree." She gives your hand a light squeeze then skips a small distance away.

      <DefaultText>Coty shakes his head quickly and lowers his voice. "Didn't have the nerve. I mean... maybe they're sensitive about it. Besides, I like this job, and I wouldn't want to give them a reason to throw me out."

He glances furtively at his employers. "If you find out, though... I'd love to know." </DefaultText>
