      <DefaultText>Rings of energy pulse around the stasis pod. There appears to be nothing inside it, but a control interface hovers a few centimeters off the surface at one end of the pod.

Surprisingly, the words on the interface are written in the Truth, and you can understand them. There are several options, but most of them are dimmed out. The only two functioning options are "Check Status" and "Access Data."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A picture of the pod appears. The lid on the image is closed and flashing red. Several other places on the image of the pod flash red as well.

The text says, "Stasis pod empty. Error: Self-diagnostic failed. Cannot open stasis pod. Primary functions offline. Data integrity: 67%."

{GEORGE: The text is written such that the player doesn't get any ideas about opening or using it, HOWEVER if we ever have need of a stasis pod in a side quest, we could open this up to be of use elsewhere. Alternatively, this thing could actually have been used to incubate synthetic living crystals, or even to hatch the crystalvores. -JF/AH}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Preliminary investigations suggest that Mazzof was correct. The crystals of the Ascension bear the properties we require to complete the resonance chamber. The Annulet proved invaluable in reaching this place and may have other uses besides, so it will be some time before I can return it to Dracogen. Much more experimentation is required before I can know for certain whether the Ascension holds what I seek."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The secretions of the crystalvore are one of the few substances I've found that can eat through the living crystal of the Ascension. I have had several larvae brought here for that purpose. Dracogen exudes patience with regard to the Annulet, but I've dealt with other Dracogens before. He will only remain patient for so long before he decides I have cheated him. No matter. I fear the Sorrow more than I fear *them*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Several of the crystalvore larvae hatched prematurely and escaped. It's unclear how it happened, but I suspect that *someone* came looking for the Annulet while I was buying supplies in Sagus. No doubt they tampered with my machines in their efforts to find it."

The voice sighs. "To prevent further sabotage, I have placed the Annulet and the remaining larvae behind an energy field. The power generator can open the field, but it now requires a passcode sequence to ensure there is no further tampering."</DefaultText>

He pauses. "I've built a device to emit sound waves at a very specific frequency, lulling the creatures into dormancy. So far, it appears to be an effective countermeasure, but I shall have to keep careful watch to be sure. I must also make sure that the power generator does not experience *any* interruptions lest they wake again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Ascension natives may prove useful as well. I had ignored them initially, for although their Speaker is capable of cogent communication, it has proven useless in providing any real information.
