      <DefaultText>He scoffs. "That's ridiculous. We're just severing the Tidal connections - the thing that draws the Sorrow to us in the first place. How could that possibly..."

He trails off, gazing into space. His lips continue to move as he does calculations in his head. He blurts out, "Skist. *Skist!* You might be right. Even if you're not, that's a heavy chance to take."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, yeah, it wou..." His eyes widen as realization dawns. "Oh. Oh, no, that won't be necessary."

He takes two steps back from the chamber. "Here, see? I'm done fiddling with it. Just leave me out of this."</DefaultText>
