      <DefaultText>The young man takes a deep breath, as though preparing himself for something. He looks directly into your eyes. His expression is not merely sober. It is resigned and emotionless - almost dead.

      <DefaultText>Coty looks at the swirling red-and-black fluid and then up at you. "All right, I guess."

      <DefaultText>Coty looks around nervously. "Stealing around here is *risky*. Everyone's on edge, and *everyone* seems to have weapons handy. I was being careful and still almost got caught."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>Coty's shoulders droop and he frowns. "I dug through the trash all day, like you told me. I didn't find anything. Well, I found stuff, but none of it was worth anything."

"I think I have an idea of where to look next, but only if you send me back soon. That old mutant out there said the trash shifts around a lot. If you wait a day or so, I could end up looking through the same piles without even knowing it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Coty looks tired, but determined. "Didn't find anything yesterday either, but I think I'm close. Want me to head out there again today, or did you have something else in mind?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>Coty's bouncing on his heels when you approach him. "All right, so I still didn't find anything, but I swear I'm close. That old mutant said some of the stuff I keep finding in this one patch means there's something *good* in there somewhere. I just need a little more time to find it. But I suppose I could do other stuff instead, if you want."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>Coty smiles at you, his eyes flashing with triumph. "Honestly, I thought digging in the trash was a waste of time, like you were just being nice to me. But check out what I found!" He hands you a small (smelly) object.

"So what's the plan for today?"

      <DefaultText>"We were kids. I used to play pranks on her all the time. Stupid pranks, but I never meant any harm. But one time..."

He swallows hard, twice. Then his story bursts out of him like water from a dam. "Cassandra couldn't swim, right? But she loved the water. She'd go out on the harbor every day in this little coracle. Just to scare her, I dug a leak in the boat. Then I hid behind a rock and waited for her to come. But I... I..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I didn't turn myself in for a long time. I spent ten years running, wishing I could just cut out my heart so I wouldn't have to feel the guilt and pain anymore." He clutches his chest for emphasis.

"The third time they caught me for stealing, they told me I was a man now, responsible for my actions and old enough for a man's prison. I thought about what that meant - to be a man, to own what I did - and I decided I had to start over, but not before I'd paid for what I'd done."</DefaultText>

      <ID>118</ID>
      <DefaultText>The scream lasts a long time, changing its tone like some alien dirge - first high-pitched and terrible, then gradually lower, until it sounds like a forced battle cry. Finally, it stops, leaving Coty breathless with gritted teeth.

He calms down and shakes his head as though shaking off a bad dream. He looks at you, his eyes still dead but no longer resigned. They are cold, like an animal's.</DefaultText>
