      <DefaultText>You take a step toward the Maw, instinctively closing your eyes. The Bloom-tongues wrap themselves around you, gently, like a many-armed lover. Your ears are filled with the hisses and chitters and whispers of the Bloom, but the sounds are soft and tender as a caress.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You draw out the battered metal jar and hold it aloft, well within reach of the tongues. Nearby, you hear a sharp intake of breath from the Speck. "Is that - "

Risking a glance toward her, you see that her eyes are bright with wonder... and also horror. She watches the movements of the tongues, and it's clear that she has no idea what's going to happen next.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old woman scuttles a little closer, slapping away a roving tendril as if it's nothing but a household pet.

"It hungers for a *predator*," she murmurs, "one who is feared above all others. A person... a creature... the Maw doesn't care."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He steps forward quickly and eagerly, trying to compose his face to look serious and heroic at the same time. "Let me at this doorway. I have a mind for these things."

He sweeps around and bows to you. "My dear friend, if I do not return, hold my memory high in your heart!" He is trying to look grim and determined and fails miserably.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's good. I regard myself as a predator too. You know what predators *don't* do? They don't offer themselves as prey." Her voice is tight. "Find yourself another victim."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs, a tinkling, time-distorted effect as several of her echoes catch the words late. Her reflections seem divided, some of them showing open alarm while others express interest. "Perhaps," she says. "The notion of existing inside a Maw as it peels open a pathway to another world would be fascinating." She looks at some of her rippling 'sisters' and says, "Convince me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...but it soon becomes clear that the Bloom-tongues are only interested in you. They stretch themselves toward you, as if eager to wrap you in their embrace. Even the whispers and chitters of the Bloom sound inviting to your ears, tempting you closer to the Maw.

      <DefaultText>Several tongues are fixated upon Matkina, tracking her movements like hounds on a scent. When she notices this, she starts pacing back and forth, but the tongues continue to follow her.

"Hurry it up," she mutters at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tongues coil eagerly toward Erritis, but stop a bare half-meter away. They wave as if in consternation. A single tendril creeps forth and *slowly* begins to reach behind his leg.

As it touches him, a golden flash outlines Erritis. In that moment you see someone else standing in his place - a bland and fearful face, a body made to cower.

In that same instant, the Bloom-tongues snatch themselves back, drawing far from Erritis.</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>Erritis kicks at the recalcitrant Maw in disgust."Oh, being *difficult*, are we? We exposed your secret, and now you don't even have the courtesy to admit defeat and open up? So much for reasoning with this stupid tangle of tongues! Somebody get me a big knife. I'll pry this thing's mouth open and we'll get to the bottom of it quickety-quick!"

Then his shoulders slump. "That's not going to work, is it? It was probably too scared of me. That must be why it didn't eat me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She thinks carefully, worry creasing her brow, and says at last, "Against my better judgment... you might be right."

She stands taller and shakes her hands to loosen her wrists. She refrains from taking her daggers into her hands, but her face hardens - and you begin to understand why she is one of the most feared assassins in the Sagus Protectorate.

She steps into the mass of Bloom-tongues.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you really trying to manipulate me into risking my very existence for your *quest*? Really?

      <DefaultText>Tendrils of energy reach into her head as the Bloom-tongues close eagerly around her body. She stiffens, resisting, and they tighten around her. She gasps, and the memories begin to spill from her lips.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not that I don't want to be helpful..." Her sarcastic tone belies the sincerity of her words. "... but let's find a way I can help without risking insanity, disfigurement, or painful death. But I'll do you a favor - I'll forget you asked."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She begins to speak again, her eyes staring off into some unknown past, but her voice is too low for you to understand. As you lean closer to hear her words, she howls in pain again.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her impassive mask breaks momentarily, a rare smile cracking her lips. "You think so?" She catches herself and turns the smile into a dour grin. "Aye, that's true. And the Bloom agrees. Let me show you how this is done."

She rolls her shoulders and relaxes her arms, and she dons the face of one of the city's most feared assassins. Without a backward glance, she strides toward the Bloom-tongues.</DefaultText>

Let me assure you: the feeling is entirely mutual."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her tinkling, off-kilter laughter sounds scornful. "Oh, Matkina. Listen to you, the great hunter, fearful of a little memory probe. Small wonder that so many think so little of you. You are unwilling to take minimal risks for great rewards, and so you consign yourself to a tiny life."

The echoes of Callistege turn toward you, a nasty smile playing about their lips. "If the little laak refuses because she is too timid, perhaps I would serve. I will take her place."

The echoes of Callistege turn toward you. "If Matkina dares not, how can I refuse? I have changed my mind. I will enter the Maw in her place."

      <DefaultText>He has been watching her, concern growing on his face, and at last he gasps. "Mattie!" He turns and grabs you. "The Bloom is hurting her, and even if she has done those horrible things and killed people, they deserved it... well, probably deserved it. Might have deserved it? Maybe they didn't." He wrenches himself away from that chain of thought. "But the point is that she's our friend, and friends help each other!"

      <DefaultText>Matkina jolts upright for a moment, as if a current were running through her body, and the veins on her arms, hands, and face all stand out. She grits through her teeth: "I. Am. The White. Death. I have. Never. Failed." Blood begins to leak from the corners of her eyes and nose. "I. Will not. Bow."

A moment later, the tendrils of energy withdraw from her skull and the Bloom-tongues curl away from her legs, and she collapses.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She slowly pushes herself away from the Maw and stands on shivering legs. "It's... it's in my head. It left a piece. Like an infection. Like - " She staggers to you and grasps your shirtfront in her fists. " - what have you *done* to me? I can hear the Bloom hissing in my head!"

Her rage leaves her, and she pulls on her composure like a mask. "I won't forget this."</DefaultText>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Bloom-tongues hiss and lash behind Matkina, their movement almost seeming to describe a pattern. The Maw emits a low moan, and a thin stream of drool spills across the ground.

The hissings and chitterings of the Bloom rise to a climax...

      <DefaultText>Scrabbling against the darkness in your eyes, you hear Matkina's voice, clipped and harsh, as if she is speaking through gritted teeth: "I. Am. The White. Death. I have. Never. Failed." A pause, and her voice sounds almost strangled. "I. Will not. Bow."

And then you hear the distinctive thump of a body hitting the ground.

      <DefaultText>Callistege steps in front of the Maw, and the Bloom's tongues recoil for a moment, almost as if they are uncertain what she offers to them. Callistege gestures impatiently at the Maw, and says, "We differ in no great regard, Bloom. Choose one or choose none. I am losing patience."

Some of Callistege's echoes flinch away from the waving tongues, and then it happens.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A cluster of tongues strikes at one of the more insubstantial Callisteges, one of her sisters almost removed from this reality, and it pulls her shrieking form into the Maw's grasp. The remaining echoes stagger as if struck and fade momentarily.

The Maw's tongues hold the echo close, and tendrils of energy float around her. Their touch seems to make her more substantial. Callistege reaches out to take her trapped echo's hand.</DefaultText>

She swallows, and tries to speak more clinically. "Apergy and gravitic force. Quantum tunneling bridges space. Bloom-tongues absorb... ahhhh... absorb psionic energies, power... spanning threads..."

She loses consciousness. Her sister slips from her hand, screaming indistinctly. The mass of tongues *hiss* and *chitter*...

      <DefaultText>You plunge the scalpel into the Maw's thick flesh. At once, a horrific, bestial scream erupts from somewhere deep inside the Bloom, carried upon hundreds of voices that howl, chitter, and roar their indignation. The cultists cower against the walls of the shrine, but the Speck stands straight, her glittering eyes never leaving you.

One of the tongues reaches forward, probing, touching the head almost delicately, sampling the 'flavor' of the mind inside. "All for you," whispers the construct softly, as if it's speaking to a small child or a lover. The tendril wraps itself carefully around the head and lifts it from your hands...</DefaultText>

Then, with a final, violent shake, the tongues hurl the jar into the Maw. The chittering and hissing rise to a climax...
