      <DefaultText>The man before you emanates gloom. His body is emaciated, and though he is quite tall, his hunched posture makes him appear shorter. The bags under his eyes are black and pouched, and his lips are almost comically downturned.

Most of the time, his body is nearly transparent, though he fades in and out of view. Terror describes every line in his body, every sidelong glance.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If you'd be able to turn the NPC into a windbag with a stammer (or just a stutter would do), I'd be very happy. Also, I had difficulties figuring a name for the NPC, so I just moved the letters in my surname arround. If it doesn't fit the setting, feel free to brand him with whatever name you like.</DefaultText>

She fell by the M-M-Maw, and as she stirred, her double appeared." He swallows. "They've been talking to each other. I d-d-don't like the looks of them. Steering clear. They might eat m-m-me! It's hard enough here without getting eaten."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The G-g-g-gullet, they call it. This is where the Bloom's food is digested. Where fear fades to despair. Where we w-w-wait to dissolve... or to die." He swallows. 

"I've survived longer than the others by hiding in shadows. The ones that fight each other are always looking for prey." He covers his eyes, but you notice they're still open. And his hands are transparent.

      <DefaultText>"I don't remember much," he says, touching a ghostly temple with a shaking hand. "I was following someone I knew - to help them? Cut them?" His fingers press into - and through - his head, but he doesn't notice. 

"A Maw burst from the floor. I fell. Heard - f-f-felt crunching." He raises his eyes to yours. "It was me. My bones. My body. But I'm still here." He stares through one of his transparent hands.

      <DefaultText>He looks frightened and confused. "But that will k-k-kill me, won't it? Won't it? But... what does this life have to offer me? I scuttle through the Gullet, picking pieces of food the B-b-b-bloom itself has rejected. I have no friends. No family. No story. I... I hate."

      <DefaultText>A look of relief crosses his face. "Are... are you sure I won't be a c-c-coward, taking the easy way out?" He doesn't wait for an answer before reaching into his tattered clothing. He presents a metal club to you, its handle wrapped in prickly tape. "Use this. It s-s-served me well."
