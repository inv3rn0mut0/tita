      <DefaultText>Siowan is fainter than he was before. His eyeless expression is hard to read. There is resignation in it, a measure of peace, and...

...confusion. Not at the Maw before him, but at some mental puzzle. 

"Thank you for coming," he says, without looking your way. "I didn't think I could wait much longer." He takes a small, resolute step forward.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tongues slip eagerly into his spectral body, pulsing. Drinking. He flinches, looking past you, through you, and a smile, wide and joyous, splits his face. 

"I can see them! Hear them! I... " he hesitates, worry pinching his brow. "Are you still there? Are you with me?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good," he says, looking carefully in your direction. "This doesn't feel... feel bad. I'm breaking apart, I *feel* it, but I'm remembering things I thought I'd lost. Things the despair was hiding."

His smile returns. "I died the moment I came here. But I was loved. I remember that. They must have grieved. Even while I was standing here, eyeless and despairing, they were singing the Songs for me in the village. Hand in hand, singing the Songs."</DefaultText>

Fed by Siowan's despair, the Maw opens.</DefaultText>
