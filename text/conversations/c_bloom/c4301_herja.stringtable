      <DefaultText>This striking woman towers over you. Though she seems gaunt and her skin is pale, even whitish, she still has a healthy glow that shines through a layer of dirt and grime. A flat circle of metal is affixed to her forehead, showing through her long blonde hair. At your approach, she begins to flex and tense - not in fear, but in preparation to fight. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs. "These... *mutants*... have accused me of a crime. They tell me that I must confess to this imaginary horror before they will let me go. So here I sit, rotting away, while they ask me to choose between the truth and my freedom." She rolls her shoulders and looks you squarely in the eye. "I choose to honor the truth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You press the disk into her skin, and she draws back from you, backing into the wall of the imaginary cage behind her. When she has nowhere else to go, she presses herself against as if steeling herself against pain.

You turn the disk three times counterclockwise, and it falls off her head into your hand. Herja staggers backward as the cage disappears, landing on her rump.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her heavy armor is scarred by energies and battered by blades, but it seems to have retained its integrity. The sigil of two crossed swords is etched into the breastplate.

She glowers, "Have you come to beat the poor prisoner? Then be ready to tell your friends about the day Herja bested you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crossed swords etched upon her armor remind you of the book you were given by Falinda in Circus Minor. This formidable woman wears the sigil of the Angulan Knights, an order known for its devotion to justice and its desire to reclaim the world for humanity. But they also persecute abhumans and mutants.

      <DefaultText>Then she studies you more closely. "Or have you come to question me? Tell Gar-koto that my answer is unchanged. He can rot in his soup." She pauses for a moment. "I would appreciate an honest soup. The food they provide here would shame a murden."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>She presses her hand to her face, making a show of her embarrassment, but she still looks wary when she draws her hand away. "My apologies, then. The mutants demand that I confess to a crime I did not commit, and I thought they were sending a human this time to break my will." She looks around. "It will be good to speak of other things, with a true-blooded human."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The mutant prince? He - *it*, I need to remember the mutant is both male and female - swims in its disgusting stew of a tank, bathing in its own filth, and somehow it summons powers that keep the rest of its creatures in line. They said Gar-koto was a wizard... I didn't believe them until the mutant imprisoned me with its powers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Which part do you want to hear again - how it lives as both a male and a female, how it can't survive outside its tank, how it captured me and imprisoned me within its spell?" She waves her hand dismissively. "I'm tired of talking about the mutant. Ask me something else."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a moment, her eyes threaten to tear, and then she steels herself. "Prince Gar-koto has cast a spell on me. Here, let me show you." She steps toward you, reaching a hand out to grasp your shoulder, but before she can touch you, her fingers begin to bend as if they had encountered an invisible wall. "You see? But in case you think I jest with you..." 

She hurls herself at you, shoulder first, and she rebounds dramatically, staggering backward. "I am confined to this space until I confess."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because they require someone to blame for some deaths among their people, and they chose me. The scum looked for someone *different* from them, and I happened to be nearby." She barks an unpleasant laugh. "At this point, I'm inclined to show them what kinds of horrors I *could* visit upon them."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gasps. "You have heard of us all the way out here? We are many, many kilometers from Steadfast - even from the Beyond - and I have not yet met another who has heard of my order."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looking at her with fresh eyes, you realize that the crossed swords on her armor are the sigil of the Angulan Knights - an order known for its devotion to justice and helping to reclaim the world for humanity. But they draw the line at the misfits of the world: abhumans and mutants.

      <DefaultText>She laughs with delight and then claps her hands over her mouth. "Thank Angule," she breathes. "I thought you might have been a mutant-lover and a race traitor.

      <DefaultText>She studies you carefully, weighing your words against some internal barometer. At last, she says, "Yes. It's true that I poisoned their water. I could not enter Nihliesh itself, but I had heard of this bastard offshoot of their clan. I wanted to slay one of the Fahat. I took the journey from the Steadfast under considerable peril, and I brought death with me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The disk on her forehead pulses briefly and loses its cohesion to her flesh. It falls to the ground, and Herja's eyes widen as her imaginary prison disappears.
 
She bends over to pick up the disk, and she passes it to you with a mocking smile. "As a knight, I live by my honor. And it's my honor to put some miles between this place and me. A quick jaunt to this Maw, and then I'll show my heels."</DefaultText>

She tosses her hair. "If we must take up the blade to mete out justice, we do not hesitate. We travel Midgard for the betterment of all, and those who oppose our mission soon see the error of their ways. In the Steadfast, the Order of Truth itself blesses us."</DefaultText>

You lift your hand and wave it through the air. You can even step close to her, and you feel nothing. She takes your hand and says, "Now step back." You do, and at the exact same point where she rebounded from the air, her hand is torn from yours.

"They have to have their criminal," she says. "I suppose I fit their bill."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a slight sneer, Herja steps toward the Maw. "I will tell you what I *regret*," she declares. "Let the Bloom do its worst." 

Confidence shines from her face, and her proud carriage - even despite the filth that smears her - makes her look every inch the knight she claims to be. The Maw's tongues reach out to her, grasping and tugging, and as they penetrate into her flesh and draw her close, you can see the first flickers of doubt and fear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She grabs the food from your hand and devours it without taking time to savor it. "Ye gods," she exclaims, "I have missed this."

Her smile of pleasure is immediate and sincere, and she relaxes visibly for the first time. "Thank  you," she says. "That was one of the finest things anyone has done for me in years."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs aloud, triumphant. "No need to escort me, friend. Upon my honor, I accept these terms." She looks around Little Nihliesh, her lip curling. "So I'm to serve a short time with this Decanted thing, eh? I don't know what that is, but I tell you that I'll be glad to do whatever it takes to put some distance between myself and this cesspit."

"You have my gratitude. That's no small thing." She straightens her hair and clothes, then marches proudly toward the exit.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank Angule," she breathes. "I thought you might have been a mutant-lover and a race traitor. They *are* disgusting, aren't they? I thought a powdered tincture of axium ensemble would 'cure' them - they must be suffering, don't you think? - but they only sickened and the oldest and weakest died. If only you could carry on my work. Perhaps you should consider joining the Knights, should you ever make it to the Steadfast."

Perhaps you would share your feelings with Gar-koto then. Perhaps he'll have us fight for their amusement." She smirks and clenches a fist, as though excited by the idea.</DefaultText>
