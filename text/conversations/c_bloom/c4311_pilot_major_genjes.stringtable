      <DefaultText>He wipes a cloth across a clear glass eye, and glances at you. "You have spoken with some, yes? We have lived here long.

      <DefaultText>Worry stamps its lines on the features of this man. Like the others in the Anchorage, he wears a suit of ornate armor, but he has set aside his helmet. His hair is thinning, and wrinkles web around his eyes and across his forehead.

He is tinkering with some display, but he turns away from it to address you. "Greeting. I am Genjes, Pilot-Major of this Anchorage."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He beams, proud of his surroundings. He gestures at the blinking projections on the walls, at the great orb that spins in the middle of the room. "This, friend, is the Cortex Chamber. Inside this shell is the navigational cortex, the mind that watches the Void. The Anchorage's sensors, its antenna arrays, its projectors, its knowledge... all these things concentrate here. It is a... *holy*... place."</DefaultText>

Information from antenna arrays filters in here - *all* knowledge of the Anchorage passes the Cortex. If I fail in my duties, the Ship might arrive without my foreknowledge. So I clean, and listen, and study. If the Ship should come in my life - and I believe it may - I will take its mind in mine and we will plot a course for Home."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As Genjes bends over a low mirror, you strike at the base of his neck. At least, that was your plan. Instead, you trip over a small protrusion on the floor as you step toward him, and you fall down and strike your own head.

Genjes hurries to your aid. "This is a dangerous room for you, outlander. Perhaps you should leave." His eyes are level. "You may accidentally hit me next. Guards will escort you. Guards!"

      <DefaultText>Captain Janur summons the crew, and when they have assembled she speaks to them for long moments in their own tongue. Her face shines; you hear gasps and cries of muted praise. Some weep openly.

When she finishes her speech the lascars line up outside the portal to the Bloom. 

"Outlander, whatever lies beyond the Bloom is the place we call home. Our service is done. Our thanks."
 
She presses the navigational cortex into your hand, and follows her crew out of the Anchorage.
