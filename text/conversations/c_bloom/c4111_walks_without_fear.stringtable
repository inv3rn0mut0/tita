      <DefaultText>Yet as you draw near, somehow he hones in directly on your face, and you have the unnerving feeling that he can see more than what's on the surface. The staring sockets are deep and cavernous, as if they contained depths and space beyond the confines of his skull.

      <DefaultText>"The Bloom took my old life from me. I woke in its beating heart and gestated there while it digested my memories. I remember... I remember being terrified. But I do not remember what terrified means."

He shakes his head to clear it. "I had a name. I had a body. I had emotion and a life outside of this form. But I do not remember any of those things now. I do not remember fear. I am reborn in a new life. I am *free*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His lips part in a feral smile as he grasps at the last memories in his mind. "The *new* Memovira. Pah! What has she done worth mentioning? Who trembles at her voice? Tell me - who fears her steps? Who among her people wouldn't slip a blade into her back? Oh, she did for me, it's true, her and her coterie, but I had loyal retainers to the end. Loyalty and fear, like a fist. She may have taken my place, but she'll never match my rule."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His sockets stare into you for a moment while he considers. At last he shakes his head and says, "I do not know. I... I have language, and I have the memory of muscles, but I do not remember how I came by these truths. What I remember is...waking in the depths of the Bloom. I remember walking. I remember years of darkness before I emerged into the upper reaches at last."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first you're not sure if your eyes are playing tricks on you. A semi-transparent man shuffles and struts before you, his body fading into and out of incorporeality. His once-fine clothes have rotted away, his long beard looks to be host to any number of small vermin, and his eye sockets are disturbingly empty. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns his cavernous eye sockets to her and they study her for a long time, considering. Life begins to seep into his face, and a small smile creeps across his lips. "I... I think I remember. But memories are lost in the telling." He thinks again. "Better to tell it now and have the story remembered. You say I am the old Memovira. So we must speak of the new to understand my tale."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Disappointment colors her face, and she stares at  him equally intently. "You don't remember the rebellion of the Chacal brothers? The influx of the Nessian Guard? How you showed us the secrets of the Bloom, and laughed when the ways had changed the next day?" Seeing no recognition, she ventures, "Do you remember Bogun?"

He does not react. She shakes her head. "His memory is gone." Her voice drops. "His accomplishments live only in our memories now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Bloom reaches through dimensions and across realities. What did I see? I saw a vast beating heart. I traveled through skeins of the Bloom's arteries and its viscera. I stood in open Maws and looked out across alien landscapes where lost sailors mourn for home, or crystal fields glitter under distant stars. I walked through the slave block where the Great Chila staged her revolution. What would you know?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Chila was born there. Not physically, but her legend. The first M-... the first Me... Memovira."

      <DefaultText>His eye sockets focus on you, and his expression gains a semblance of life. "The Memovira... Brusca." He looks at his ghostly hands, and when he looks back up at you, a light seems to blaze in the holes in his face.

"Was I the old Memovira? Oh yes. Oh. *Yes.* I ruled the Bloom with strength and wisdom, and the slums ran red at my word. The council of Sagus Cliffs feared me. The merchants who trod my streets paid me. My word was law, and none dared stand against me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He snarls. "A backstabbing harlot, a scheming whore, she couldn't hope to hold what I'd built. She has a talent for brutality but no mind for structure. Even if I've forgotten her, I'll laugh when the Bloom devours her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He smiles, a cruel thing almost lost in his beard. "I lived with my knife in my hand. I never lost my love for its kiss. I took what I wanted and I shared with the best of my crew. But I had laws, mind you, laws and strictures that kept the merchants pouring through the Bloom. No sense in scaring off the easy meat, no need to be greedy. They said I was weak, but that was because they didn't know how strong I truly was. And that's why the bitch came for me. Too grasping, she was."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She knew the Bloom was angry with me. She told me she'd been below and had seen something that she thought might explain why I lost my bond. I didn't know she'd hidden her killers around the Bloom, or that she was the one who'd ruined shipments or driven off the citizens. She'd put her muscle into play, and I never even saw it. And she took me to the heart of the Bloom..." He swallows.</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She brought me through a new Maw, an entry to the Heart I'd never seen. It was then that I knew what she intended, and we fought. But she was fast and strong, and I was old and drunk. She didn't kill me, though, oh no. She wanted me to suffer for the crime of raising her up. She bound me there, and she stood above me and reveled in my pain as the Bloom sucked away everything that I was. I'll say this for her - she was better at malice than ever I was."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her face is more animated than you have ever seen it. "Do you recall when we came down on the Repcod and their trade in sense-stealers?

They cast us through Maws under unfamiliar suns. I fled into the city with a few of your lieutenants, and we had to kill some of our friends to get through the gates. And once we'd settled in up there, she started hunting us in the city, too."

She shakes her head. "She cast aside years of tradition to hunt me. I'd have sworn loyalty when you died."

She considers. "But you're right. If we survive this, it's a skist trade. Fine. You've convinced me with your fancy sarcasm. Let's make sure we stop the Sorrow then, yeah?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I knew the Bloom reaches across worlds. I knew that my old boss could command the flesh of the Bloom itself. But I never... I never quite understood just how it could be used. Each of the Bloom's tendrils can anchor itself on worlds we barely dream. The Maws are just the tips of those strands. The Bloom is moving through *realities*, and the person who can control it has all those possibilities at her fingers. With a strike team and good weapons, you could create an empire."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course. I should have thought of that." She says nothing more, but you can see her thoughts racing, rearranging. "You've played the innocent well, I have to admit."
