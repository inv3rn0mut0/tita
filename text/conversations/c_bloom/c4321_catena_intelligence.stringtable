      <DefaultText>A pale blue light pulses gently. The air in this space feels charged, almost solid. A small glass control panel - apparently hovering in the air - winks with light and fills with tiny images.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ceredig's ghost reflects. "You.. you may be correct. The loss of physical place may be rectified through a longer and more personal memory space. I carry a neural network. Let us establish a direct connection. I have the necessary tool."

A hidden panel slides open. Within lies a vaguely head-shaped mass of metal wire, all spines and jagged edges.

"Place this atop your head," he murmurs. "A few more moments, and we can begin the data transfer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the catena's intelligence gone, your work proceeds quietly and quickly. You slide the containment device open. Inside the glowing blue tube, you see a rack of ten cylinders. Nine of them are cold and inert, but one of them hums and blurs, a barely perceptible vibration as it fades into and out of this reality.

You gently remove the clamps that hold the powered cylinder in place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lights wink out. A deep, almost-ultrasonic moan ripples down the catena's walls as the power within the tubes and wires flickers away. An alien voice babbles something over a small speaker near the control panel.

You are left standing in darkness. Everything around you is quiet and still.

      <DefaultText>You study the control panel carefully. If the catena were in motion, you suspect it would convey much more information than is currently available. As it is, you're able to see that it has traveled to thousands of destinations along a route that follows specific dimensional pathways, on a circuit that - if you're reading this right - reached through the stars.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>It appears that the arcs fire in a complicated pattern, but a few moments of regarding that pattern settles it in your mind. Your fingers dart in and out until at last you manage to complete the process. 

The power core has been ejected from the assembly. Now you need to move it into the containment unit.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>After some intense studying, you come to the conclusion that the icons on the panel indicate that the power core remains outside its housing assembly. You'll have to transfer the core to its containment unit before you can remove it. 

A tiny image flashes in the top right corner of the panel. It depicts a broken connection between the control panel and its power source. You won't be able to make that transfer until the control panel receives more power.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>You tap the broken-power image. The old icons disappear, and a new screen of options appears. You study it carefully. One of the images shows an alien claw swiping through a complicated series of gestures at the panel, and then pushing an icon that looks like a wave.

You imitate its motions, and the panel winks back to full functionality.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>Now that power has been restored, you are able to complete the transfer of the core, it appears - at least according to the instructions - that the only task remaining is to remove the containment unit.

Unfortunately, the unit appears to be stuck. The column of light has locked the containment device into place.

It seems the catena is working to stop you.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>The instruments on the panel suggest that the power for the catena is currently housed in the containment unit. The flashing red icon further suggests that the ejection sequence for the containment unit appears to have failed. It seems its holding field hasn't faded, and the field holds it tight. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is as if you look down upon a billion stars swirling around holes of pure *emptiness*, a darkness deeper than anything you have seen before. You see red lines shift toward infrared and then blackness, and then the holes burst open in a fountain of brilliant white. The foundation scatters stars that circle around new holes, fade to black, and the cycle repeats. 

The catena seems to run on collapsing singularities.

      <DefaultText>You rock the unit back and forth, slowly pushing it through the coherent light. At last, you manage to angle it out of the plume of light. You pull it free. 

As you extract it, your elbow somehow strikes a hidden release, and a panel slides open. Some interesting devices are inside, and you slide them into your pouch as you remove the containment unit.

      <DefaultText>You rock the unit back and forth, slowly unseating it, until you manage to get it angled in such a way that you can slide it out of the column of light. 

But as you begin to pull it out, you manage to trip some failsafe, and the light hardens, pulling the unit from your fingers and snapping it more firmly into place.

      <DefaultText>Leaning close, you study the icons and symbols, trying to ascertain their meanings. It looks like you need to enter information in the proper order. You settle in for applied experimentation.

Slowly, methodically, you uncover the correct sequence. You enter it, and the containment field winks out.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Leaning close, you study the icons and symbols, trying to ascertain their meanings. You're certain that some of these icons have hidden meanings - some sort of higher-frequency light, or a subsonic pulse - that will unlock the secret. With slow, careful experimentation, you uncover the correct sequence. You enter it, and the containment field loosens its grip.

Another panel opens, revealing a strange device. You release the enclosing field and pick up the device.

      <DefaultText>You repeatedly try to find a way to retract the unit, but your unfamiliarity with the control panel means that you're unable to take advantage of your fix to the power drain. The control panel begins to lose power once more.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>You poke and prod at the control panel. Nothing. Next you search around for visible wires or connections that might indicate a way to redirect power. Perhaps there's a way to bypass the power source and get the control panel fully functional, but you're completely at a loss.

You realize the ghosts have been silent. They are staring fixedly at the panel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you poke at the control panel, you somehow activate a sequence that not only restores power to the panel, but that replaces the power core into the containment unit and ejects the unit itself. You reach in and remove the device from the tube.</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>Despite your efforts, the control panel's power goes out completely. A soft female voice speaks: 

"Improper access attempted. For safety reasons, the power core has been returned to its original assembly. Please wait before interacting withi this panel again."

After a short time - and a number of sounds that you can only describe as *ominous* - limited power returns to the control panel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The small arcs fire in a complicated pattern, and you find it difficult to understand them. You keep putting your hands in the wrong places, or not pulling them away quickly enough. You finally manage to finish the sequence, but you take some minor burns.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>You assess the firing pattern of the arcs and quickly enter the ejection sequence for the power core. It seems like a very intuitive process. 

A moment later, you see a new icon light up. Apparently, the power core has been ejected from the main assembly and now must be tranferred to the containment unit.</DefaultText>

You catch flickers of strange stellar formations, a wormhole piercing a dark and violet field in the sky, a lush explosion of life behind the hurtling catena...

You absorb the passengers, and feel them alive again in the Labyrinth even as their ghosts wink out around you.

And you know that one of them has something to tell you.

You revel momentarily in the motion, an involuntary reflex as you recognize the catena's mind alongside your own. It regards you as well, momentarily distracted, and in that critical moment you see a wall of Bloom-flesh rising before you. You plow into it, and you feel your innards explode.

You silently scream as pain erupts in your mind. You tear your mental self away before you do any more damage.

      <DefaultText>The varjellen answers your question. "We have told you already. We are the projections of - " the voice changes, continuing, " - my  machine mind. They exist now as a memorial to the fallen passengers, a testament to my own failure to save them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You push the net down over head, and it drinks of your blood again. This time, as the wires enter your optic nerves, you open yourself to the Tidal forces. You reach across the human/machine connection and draw the catena's data structure into your shared imagination.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A welter of images rushes into your head. Telemetry, destination, access to old records, ambient temperatures... it's almost too much to process, but you manage to tamp down the flow and relegate it to the background.

One by one, the ghosts around you begin to wink out of existence. You can feel them awakening inside you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lights in the catena flicker and dim, fading slowly as the residual power within them expires. The further lights go first, darkness marching along the catena toward the power source. As the slow wave of darkness builds, it snatches the ghosts into oblivion as well.

      <DefaultText>The ghosts of the passengers crowd around you, and though they cannot touch you, they can distract you. Light shines into your eyes, voices fill your ears, and all of them whisper and urge you to stop what you intend.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The panel brings up a wealth of information about the catena's systems in the form of tiny animated images. One of the icons appears to initiate the sequence to eject the catena's power core.</DefaultText>

      <ID>106</ID>
      <DefaultText>You press the icon. Immediately, a host of other icons spring to life. From what you can tell, multiple steps must occur before the power core can be removed. You'll have to draw the power source from the assembly, direct it into a containment unit, and then cause the containment anchors to release. Then you can extract the unit from the machine. It seems like this should be fairly straightforward, if laborious.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you complete the ejection, you notice that power is quickly draining from the console. You quickly isolate the source of the electrical arcs to divert power back into the panel. 

With that out of the way, you quickly transfer the core into the containment unit. Now you just need to remove it.

... but wait.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You close your eyes and listen to the psychic chatter of the ghosts... and then you realize that they have no thoughts of their own. They are being controlled from a central point.

      <DefaultText>You place the net atop your head, and the metal cuts into your scalp. You feel a coolness as blood trickles upward into the device. Thin wires enter your peripheral vision and slip behind your eyes. They slice into your optic nerves, and the agony paints blossoms across your vision. The ragged shapes of pain resolve into the world around you - the world as the catena sees it. 

"Connection established," the catena announces.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You lower the cage onto your head, and the jagged points slash into your skin. The net devours your blood. In the periphery of your vision, you see two thin wires. You barely manage to get your hands up in time before they puncture your eyes. You shake the net loose from your head.

The catena's tone is chiding. "You have refused the connection. I assure you, no harm will come to you if you follow the proper procedures."</DefaultText>
