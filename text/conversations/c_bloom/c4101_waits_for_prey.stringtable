      <DefaultText>A metal construct stands before you, silent and still. Its armor is pitted and ancient, spiked with metal thorns. Instead of arms, the construct has long killing blades, sharpened to a gleaming edge. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The construct's blade-arms suddenly clench, whirring into a new configuration with such speed that your eyes cannot follow. A moment ago they seemed sleek and clinical, like a chiurgeon's well-honed knife - now they are jagged and cruel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can it be?" 

The construct falls silent, its eyeless "face" staring into yours for such a long time that you begin to wonder if it's fallen into slumber. But no... you realize that the creature is watching you carefully, perhaps trying to determine if you are telling the truth. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The construct is silent for a long moment, as if considering your words. "Even if that was so, and the Bloom hungered for me, why would it not open a Maw and devour me here?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You may find him in the vast interior space beyond the arterial opening, there." The construct gestures with one bladed arm to its right.

      <DefaultText>The construct inclines its head, and its arm-blades retract in an almost reverent manner, as they might have done for some long-lost king or commander. 

"I have seen him too." The hollow voice is quiet. "I would follow in his path, if the Bloom would let me."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>The construct moves its head from side to side. Tiny lights of a dozen different colors, some of which you can barely perceive, flash from inside its helmet. Simultaneously, you hear a variety of clicks and tones, and for an instant you feel a prickling sensation that runs up and down your body. 

You have the sense that you are being viewed - or *examined*, perhaps - in a multitude of ways.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Changing God," the hollow voice intones, as if recalling the name from some deep void. 

"Your sire walked this place before you. The bonds he forged with the Bloom are not the sort that are easily broken. You carry his scent upon you, castoff, and the Bloom *will* remember."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Or choose not to tell." A series of clicks bursts from inside the helmet, like the rattle of bone dice. You aren't sure if they indicate irritation, amusement, or something else entirely. "No matter. I do not count curiosity among my stronger impulses. It is enough to know that you are not so easily slain."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No," the construct inclines its head. "It is not. But *every* creature can be slain, and you are no exception. To judge by the hunted look in your eyes, I believe that Death stalks you even now, though perhaps you know it by a different name."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>79</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes," it says at last. "I believe you. Allow me a moment to prepare."

You hear a grinding noise from inside the construct's armor, so loud and grating that passers-by turn to look in fear and then hurry along on their business. Suddenly there is a loud crack, like the snapping of a spinal cord.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>In the next moment, you realize that's exactly what it was. The construct's head is teetering at the top of its body, wobbling freely, and its limbs have gone limp. 

Its voice, far less resonant than before, issues from inside the head. "I have no further use for this body. If I am to leave the soldier's path behind me, the Bloom will provide another, better suited to my new life. I am ready now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"HOW DARE-" the droning voice exclaims, but it instantly cuts off. The blade-arms fall limply to the construct's sides, and the humming and whirring sounds from inside its armor go silent. You hear a hissing sound and a snap, and the construct topples to the ground, its head disengaging from its body.
