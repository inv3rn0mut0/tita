      <DefaultText>This burly man's face seems to have been partially melted in some unspeakable battle. Keeping his eyes on the mutants, he says, "Ask your questions, but you might want to do it quick. I don't think our hosts want to put off their fun for much longer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He coughs a bit, a wet hack, and says, "We make this route every month. We're collectors. It's our job to bring in revenues for the Memovira from her loyal subjects - " He pauses as the mutants break out raucous, derisive laughter, then continues, " - but they laid in wait for us, and got the jump on us as we walked into Little Nihliesh."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... don't know. The patrol schedules have been spotty lately, and we had another one go missing just the other day - " He clamps his mouth shut. He hastily adds, "-but the Memovira spared no expense to find them."

No one believes him.

      <DefaultText>He opens his mouth to disagree, and then realizes what you're saying. "Ah... yes, of course. The Memovira keeps a close eye on her patrols. This money is important to her operation, and she sends backup to make sure none of it goes missing. They're bloody-minded bastards, too."

The mutants' muscles tense as they lean away. They exchange worried glances.

      <DefaultText>"She pays us, mostly. And the mercenaries who come through the Maws, and the bribes to the Sagus Cliffs officials... but she's been falling further and further behind on those payments."

He swallows and looks at the mutants around him. "Like as not she'll want vengeance if we fall. She *needs* this money, and she'll use her nastiest tricks to get it back."

The mutant leader shifts his weight as the sergeant speaks, but he does not retreat.
