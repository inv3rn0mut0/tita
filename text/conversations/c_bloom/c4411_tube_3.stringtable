      <DefaultText>From a bloated sphincter in the wall, a vile mix spews into the room, flowing down into the pool. It smells like a foul coupling of sewage and vomit. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> You pry open the end of the tube and force the Egg inside. The pressure builds behind the Egg, and the tube begins to convulse violently as if trying to dislodge the blockage, but after a moment, you're satisfied that the seal will hold.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You shove the metal orb into the opening, and it explodes, encasing the interior of the sphincter in a blob of instantly-hardened synth. The surrounding flesh bulges, and the sphincter emits a great, rumbling groan, but the seal holds firm. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The blob projects a questioning, doubtful thought at you, and oozes over to the tube. Flowing up, it shapes itself around the nozzle. Oom's skin smokes and boils, but the toy holds tight, choking off the tube until it lets go.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Egg is almost exactly the right size to shove into the orifice. You can see two ways to do this: either jam it straight in, or kink the tube and wedge the Egg inside. Bending the tube looks like it might be a bit of a challenge, but the pressure of the fluid might result in getting sprayed otherwise.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You crimp the hose, managing to avoid the worst of effluvia (though some does spatter on your skin, burning you slightly). With the flow of the juices temporarily halted, you shove the Egg far up the distended nozzle. You slowly uncrimp the tube, and the pressure behind the Egg shoves it to the end of the tube... but the Egg holds in place. The liquid has stopped flowing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grab the tube and try to kink it... but your grip is weak, and the nozzle sprays the noxious fluid through the air. You dodge away, frustrated, but at least you manage to avoid spattering yourself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grab the tube and try to kink it... but your grip is weak, and the nozzle sprays the noxious fluid through the air. Some of it spatters you, burning your skin, and some lands right near your eyes. Even the scent of this goo is enough to make your eyes water, and you stagger away, retching.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The egg is almost exactly the right size to shove into the orifice. You force it into the opening, spraying Bloom-juice in all directions. It hisses and burns when it hits your bare skin, but you ignore the pain, shoving the egg deeper until the flow of liquid has stopped. The sphincter convulses once or twice, but your makeshift seal holds firm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You try to shove the egg into the orifice, but the flow of Bloom-juice is too strong, and the egg keeps slipping out of your grasp. The caustic fluids spray in all directions, burning your exposed flesh, and you cry out in pain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take a firm grasp on the nozzle and shove the Egg inside. At least, that was your plan. What actually happens is that you're sprayed with noxious fluids as the Bloom-juice spatters across the surface of the Egg, and you recoil in disgust, dropping both the Egg and the nozzle.

That Bloom-juice really burns.</DefaultText>
