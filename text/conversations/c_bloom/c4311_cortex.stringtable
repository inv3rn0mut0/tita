      <DefaultText>"Of course. As I note that you are a first-time user, Stage 1 requires you to assemble a pass-symbol on the screen before you and pull the lever on the side of the console."

      <DefaultText>A flood of symbols streams across the console's tiny screen. At first, none of them look in any way familiar, but as you watch, you recognize a few. They disappear beneath your tapping fingertips with sweet, piping *pings*. 

A fluttering sound - something like an insect's wings - rises from the console, and the casing pops open. You flick the switch.

      <DefaultText>You grab the ring on the top of the locking mechanism, plant your foot against the rim of the console, and pull with all your strength. 

It judders free, nearly dropping you on your backside. You twist the cylinder and shove it back into the console.

      <DefaultText>Bereft of any useful instructions, you study the sigils rotating on the screen. All of them are moving except the one in the upper left corner - the original shape assembled in Stage 1.

      <DefaultText>"Of course," the voice says, but it does not sound enthusiastic about the process. "This part of the process is based on the teachings of Captain-Philosopher Haranar. Specifically, his musings on *CRITICAL ERROR - CONNECTION TO PHILOSOPHICAL ARCHIVES IS CORRUPT*." 

Thunderous, painful static fills your mind. You grit your teeth until it subsides.
