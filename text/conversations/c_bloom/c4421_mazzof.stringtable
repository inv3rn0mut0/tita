      <DefaultText>Mazzof rises, clutching himself, and he abruptly vomits a clot of black fluid onto the glistening flesh beneath his feet. Small red wounds mar the flesh between the wires criss-crossing his skin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Gods," he growls. "*Gods*." He looks up at you. His mechanical eye sockets spin, wheels within wheels, focusing on your face. 

"You're the castoff that was riding Zerian Daywalker. What the hell are you doing down here?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Muscle-movements," he says, grimacing. "Small variations on expression. As good as a signature for those who know what to look for."

He coughs more of the black fluid against the back of his wrist. "You didn't answer me. What are you doing down here?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Suppose I am, at that," he grumbles. "But unless you're in the habit of wandering around the Bloom's guts, I..." He pauses. Smirks. 

"The First sent you, didn't she? Not surprised. She won't be getting the resonance chamber working on her own. It's all too easy to destroy the damn thing if you don't know what you're doing."

Something about the words, said in his voice, stirs a memory in you. Resonance chamber. Resonance chamber. The sensation *builds*.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He winces, teeth clenched. 

"Gods. The Bloom is a terrible host. Stuck its damn tongues into my guts to force-feed me, filled my lungs with bile... not sure what you did to get me out, but thank you."  He spits a black-tinged wad of phlegm over his shoulder.

"Well, how do we get out of here? She's waiting, and you know how she is."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods, then seems to immediately regret the motion. 

"Worst headache I've ever had," he says, spitting again. "Maybe she'll let me have a nap before we get going, eh?"

      <DefaultText>"Yeah, that's me," he says. "It's a nickname. Short for ishenizar, because I look like one. Whatever it is. But no one calls me that except..." He pauses. Smirks.

      <DefaultText>His expression goes wooden. 

"Skist," he says, rubbing his forehead. "Look, don't tell her I said anything. I don't need anyone shouting at me right now, let alone *her*. This is the worst headache I've ever had."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Patting you awkwardly on the shoulder, he limps past you into the portal and vanishes. 

It is only when he's gone that you see the glittering contours of a small object lying where Mazzof was standing.  

A merecaster. It must have fallen from Mazzof's pockets. You wipe the slime from the joints of the machine and add it to your belongings.

      <DefaultText>"The Bloom took me," he says with a careless shrug. "Not a surprise. It's not happy with the First, but you probably already know that. So it took *me*, because it knows I'm important to her." He says this casually, and without the faintest hint of pride.

"Anyway. I should get back to the First. She's going to be... " He waves a hand. "Well. You know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But a headache is uncoiling through your head now as well. Alarm spreads over Mazzof's face, and he reaches out to catch you as you topple forward...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're underwater. The fading pulse of a sonar alarm ripples through the water, then is gone. An invisible pressure crushes your body, squeezing your head. 

A ghibra with a castoff's tattoo rises from the dark to confront you. "I should have known. You need something of ours to finish your resonance chamber, don't you, father?" He regards you with scorn. "You haven't learned anything. You would sacrifice all of us for a chance at survival - you *and* the First. Pride blinds you both."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're wrong, Thom," you snarl. Yet his words frighten you. Is he saying Maralel's *alive*, with her own plan to stop the Sorrow? She must be stopped. Any plan of hers would be dangerous.

"I've built the resonance chamber to save us all," you say. "It has the power to weaken the Sorrow. I can *kill* the creature!" A half-truth. The chamber certainly has the power, but who knows if it would be enough to kill?

"Will you apologize to me *then*, selfish child? Will you beg my forgiveness?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You lie. You always have," Thom says calmly. "Although your motives differ, Maralel's plan and yours will result in the same end - the destruction of every last castoff. I will not allow this to happen." He makes a complicated gesture with his fingers, and the pressure on your head increases.

Thom's voice grows muffled and fades as your mind - your sire's consciousness - flees his imprisoned body, abandoning it to the ghibra in favor of a new host...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You return to consciousness, the headache fading. Your mouth tastes of seawater... or blood. 

Light and wet heat bathes the side of your face as the Bloom opens a transdimensional portal. You can't be sure where it leads, but it's certainly your only way out. Someone... Mazzof... is bracing you, holding you up. 

"You all right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To sever the..." He gives you an odd look. "You know, maybe you should ask her. I don't know enough about what's going on here. Just know that it'll free us from the Sorrow - *without* sucking us all into someone else's mind. That should be enough."

He shrugs. "She can't do it without me, though. I best be getting back."  </DefaultText>
