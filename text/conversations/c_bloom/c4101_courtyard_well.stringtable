      <DefaultText>This pool is filled with yellowish 'water' that falls from above. The surrounding Bloom-flesh is wet with hand- and foot-prints, suggesting that this is a common place for Bloom-dwellers to wash and drink.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take a sip of the yellowish 'water.' It has a greasy texture and a slightly sour taste, but it quenches your thirst. You take another sip...

...and you start to hear whispers. They're faint at first, but they grow louder, resolving into the chittering voices of the Bloom. They buzz in your ears, scratching at the inside of your skull. You stumble, struggling to keep your balance. Even as your senses dull, the Bloom's voices seem *clearer* than before.

In the depths of the pool, you think you can see something wriggling about.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You plunge into the murky fluid. As you dive deeper, you see that the shaft opens into a much larger cavity.
 
At the edge of the larger space, you reach the wriggling shape you saw from above and struggle to untangle it from a bony knot of Bloom-flesh. Finally it slips free, and you swim for the surface, reaching the top just before you run out of air.

      <DefaultText>You plunge into the murky fluid. As you dive deeper, you see that the shaft opens into a much larger cavity.

At the edge of the larger space, you try to reach the wriggling shape you saw from above, but you become disoriented in the murky fluid, unable to tell which way is up or down. You swim this way and that, trying to find your way back to the surface. Then something sharp cuts across your leg. You instinctively open your mouth to scream, and fluid streams down your throat...

      <DefaultText>The pool extends downward like the circular shaft of a well. If it has a bottom, you can't see it from here.

In the depths of the pool, your sharp eyes catch sight of a long, wormlike shape. It appears to be caught on a projection of Bloom-flesh, and it's wriggling helplessly about.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The world spins, and you find yourself staring at the aneen that stands nearby. Its eyes meet yours - they are baleful and bright. 

You realize that the Bloom's voices are not speaking to you. They're speaking to the aneen, filling its tiny mind with *hunger* to feed upon its owner, Skaydi... biting her neck, lapping up the warm blood. The whispers are speaking to Skaydi, too - deadening her senses, filling her mind with a helpless apathy. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In the light of the courtyard, you see that the wriggling 'object' is some sort of bloated worm, its skin continually shifting from one material to another - silvery metal to pliable synth to leathery scales to other materials that you can't identify. It seems to be drawn to your exposed flesh, and it would likely fasten itself to your arm or leg if you allowed it to do so.
