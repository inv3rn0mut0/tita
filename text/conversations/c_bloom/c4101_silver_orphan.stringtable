      <DefaultText>[Dracogen laughs, and says he asked the same thing of the creature when it first appeared, and it drew him some diagrams in the bloom-flesh. Unfortunately, the flesh has completely regrown in the interval, wiping out the images completely. Luckily, Dracogen says he had copies of them scribed, and pulls out several sheafs of paper and hands them to you.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Dracogen relates that on first awaking the creature immediately headed for the catena, but after crawling all over it for an hour or so, walked back here and has remained ever since. It seems to be waiting for something, but what he cannot say.]</DefaultText>
