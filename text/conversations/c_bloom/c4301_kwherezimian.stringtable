      <DefaultText>This pale, ghostly figure wears outlandish clothes and a horned helm. Opaque, tangled scars from an unfamiliar weapon loop and curl over his transparent body. 

"Oh," he says, tilting his head. "You. Have you found my brother yet?"

      <DefaultText>"Hello again," he says, giving you a salute. The large helmet tips forward, blocking his eyes. "Dammit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Really?" he says, groaning. "You told me you'd..." He trails off and slaps his forehead. The impact makes his helm tilt forward, and he puts up his hand to hold it in place. 

"Of course. Right. This is the first time we meet, isn't it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Heh. Of course we have," he says, holding the large helmet in place. "You... oh. Right. This is the first time we meet, isn't it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I like to think so," he says, shrugging. "But I don't really remember dying. Just the traveling and searching. And you'd think this helmet wouldn't keep moving around if I was, you know, spectral." 

He flashes a grin. "On the other hand, I seem to remember promising my brother I'd haunt him when I died, so that's some evidence for the other side."</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>He straightens, holding out his hand formally. "Hello. I'm Kwherezimian, and I've been traveling through time and looking for my brother for millions of years. Nice to meet you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Damn," he says, grinning. "Every time we do this, I hope you'll fall for it. And you almost never do."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good question," he says, consulting an invisible, mental list just above your head. "Thousands, I'd say. Always a pleasure, mind you, though I don't know why we keep running into each other. I don't see anyone else more than once."

He squints. "If I had to guess, it's your relationship with the Tides. But I don't mind. It's nice seeing a familiar face."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your hands slips right through his, and he punches the air in delight.

"Ha! You almost never fall for that! That'll keep me going for at least another hundred times of you *not* trying to shake my hand." 

He catches your eye and shrugs. The motion makes his helmet slip forward again. "Hey. I've been doing this a long time. You find entertainment where you can." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"At any rate. Let me know if you see my brother, huh?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, sort of like me minus the helmet," he says, thinking. "And he's from a world long ago, so he might be wearing..."

He pauses. "Oh. Right. I do this every time we meet. It's just that I usually go centuries between running into you, and I always forget that you can't have possibly seen him." He winks, but there's a touch of sorrow in it. "Still, let me know if you see him, huh?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A world long before this one," he says. "Millions of years, probably. Maybe more than that. But I'll see him again. Eventually."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What's the helmet about, anyway?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So glad you asked," he says, and he looks it. "I love this story."

He centers the helm on his head. "I ended up on this battlefield once. It was... well, it hadn't gone well for the side wearing these helmets. I walked up this blackened hill, following the shouting, and I saw... it was probably a city once. But it was on fire, and covered in black flames."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. The helmet doesn't move with him.

"There were just two fighters left - the big man wearing this helmet, and... her. She was *huge* and made of screaming shadows and that same black fire, and when the warrior charged at her, roaring, she just... touched him. She touched him, and he fell over, twitching and burning." 

He looks up at you. "One of these times, you told me she was called 'The Sorrow.' Since this is the first time we've met, I'm guessing you have some questions for *me*."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Sorrow destroyed a city?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A big one. Around the size of three Saguses and a Bloom," he says. "But, uh, the people of the city were abusing the Tides in some way."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Actually, I just want to know how the helmet fits into all this."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, the city I mentioned? The one that was burning in the Sorrow's flames? They were drawing power from the Tides. A *lot* of power."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Your perception of time is a little confusing."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Heh," he says. "It's barely clearer on my end."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"From what you told me about the Sorrow, that sort of thing makes her really unhappy."

He straightens the helmet again. "But I didn't think they deserved to vanish, despite whatever they'd done, so I took the helmet off the warrior when he'd, you know, stopped melting a bit. Now I carry it with me to remind me of them."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course I do!" he says, then raises a weary finger. "Sorry. Forgot. First time, I know." 

He yawns.  "They pull me from place to place, like normal tides do. It's why I keep seeing different times and places, and never stop in any one place for long. Tides don't rest, and neither do I."

He yawns again, even wider.  </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I made it easier for you to sense and control the Tides in other people," he says. "Don't worry about paying me. My pockets don't work."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's a little tiring sometimes. Or, at least I think I'm tired, which is probably the same thing."

"Hey," he says, focusing on you. "Can you actually sense the Tides flowing through me?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>(Lie) "Yes."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sure you did," he says, rolling his eyes. "That's why you were surprised when I mentioned them."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, let's fix that," he says, cracking his ghostly knuckles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before you can react, he thrusts all five fingers through your chest. The feeling *isn't* unpleasant. In fact, you feel the Tides surging through his arm. Through you.

And you see them curving back over your shoulders and back through him, binding you together. 

"There," he says. "It should be easier for you to sense the Tides now. Just remember that *she's* out there. Flowing around with the Tides doesn't seem to make her mad. Abusing them? I don't recommend it."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They pull me around," he says simply. "Through worlds, through time. It would be more surprising if I didn't know about them."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Scars?" he says, looking down. "Oh. Those look painful. No idea. Have to say I'm glad I don't remember, though."</DefaultText>

      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"To the what?" He looks around. "Oh. No, no I'm not. I just sort of - well, let's call it 'swim' - between places. Following currents, you know? Someone pulled a plug, and here I am."</DefaultText>
