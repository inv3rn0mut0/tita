      <DefaultText>The flesh of this Maw is dark and scabrous. It keeps itself tightly shut, like the puckered mouth of an ancient crone. You can hear its voices, and they are unusually sharp... almost painful to hear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you brandish the Scalpel, Matkina lays her hand across yours. "Wait. I've never heard of someone who hurt the Bloom casually. Even a castoff has reason to fear. Are you sure about this?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You return the transdimensional blade to its sheath. A tension drains from the air. You realize that the voices of the Bloom had suddenly hushed when you drew the Scalpel, but now they have resumed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You thrust the Scalpel into the tough, fibrous flesh of the Maw and begin to saw through its puckered 'mouth.' It gives way easily, and the Bloom's voices respond with a shriek of rage. Skin tears, gristle snaps...</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>You place a hand upon the Annulet and listen carefully to the harsh, whispering voices. They hiss in your ears with a resentment born of centuries, or perhaps millennia, in the dark bowels of the Bloom.

Despair... this is the emotion that sustains the Maw. Indeed, it is the only emotion it truly understands.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>Even with the help of the Annulet, the angry, hissing voices of the Maw are too alien to understand. Perhaps this Maw is too twisted and old, or it's simply been in this foul place for too long. Whatever the case, its desires elude you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The spiteful voices whisper indecipherable cruelties into your ears, but the meaning is impossible to discern. Again, you are forced to admit defeat. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The 'water' of the Bloom has made your thoughts blurry... yet its hissings seem almost like language to you, their meaning half-forgotten, just out of reach.

The whispers are full of *despair*... born of centuries, or perhaps millennia, in the fetid bowels of the Bloom. This must be the emotion that sustains this Maw. Perhaps it is the only emotion it truly understands.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>The voices spit and hiss, their meaning unclear but undeniably cruel. Still, you don't get the sense that the Maw's ire is directed at you. It doesn't seem to react to your presence at all.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>You detect nothing new in the voices. They are still harsh and malevolent... and utterly indifferent to your presence.</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your sharp senses provide no particular advantage in hearing the odd sounds. You realize that the Bloom's 'voices' are a psychic phenomenon, not a physical one. They are literally voices in your head. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tendrils are alert, probing the air, as if something they desire is nearby. However, it's clear that they aren't interested in you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tendrils wave gently through the air, torpid and aimless. They don't seem interested in anything nearby.</DefaultText>
