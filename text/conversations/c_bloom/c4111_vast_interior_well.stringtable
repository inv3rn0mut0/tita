      <DefaultText>You take a sip of the yellowish 'water.' It has a greasy texture and a slightly sour taste, but it quenches your thirst. You take another sip...

...and you start to hear whispers. They're faint at first, but they grow louder, resolving into the chittering voices of the Bloom. They buzz in your ears, scratching at the inside of your skull. You stumble, struggling to keep your balance. Even as your senses dull, the Bloom's voices seem *clearer* than before.

      <DefaultText>You can hear countless whispers all around you, though none of them are localized in the immediate vicinity of the pool.

      <DefaultText>The greasy, sour fluid tastes the same as the Bloom-water you drank in the Memovira's courtyard. As you sip it, you begin to hear the Bloom's whispers in your mind, while your thoughts and reflexes grow sluggish and dull.</DefaultText>
