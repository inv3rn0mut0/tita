      <DefaultText>An odd device sits in the middle of the room. It almost looks like a capsule of some sort, but it is covered with ducts and ports and vents, and a strange blue light emanates from it. Cables run from its base throughout the room, attached to various devices. It vibrates with a mild, occasionally stuttering pulse, and when it falters, the field that protects the interior of the shanty briefly fades.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The machine encapsulates a piece of Bloom-flesh, which is wired with various leads. It appears the core is a counter-stimulus device to drive the Bloom back. Resonances and frequencies use the flesh of the great predator against itself, creating a kind of energy field that repels the Bloom and keeps it from entering this chamber.

... but the constant pressure from the Bloom's hunger is driving the machine toward irrevocable, irreversible breakdown. You do not think you can repair it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After some tentative exploration around the device's extrusions and vents, you discover a rubbery switch that you think powers the energy field. When you pinch it, the machine falls silent. The flicker around the room vanishes utterly, and a deep shudder roils the Bloom. The walls of the room groan.

      <DefaultText>Determining to shut the machine down most effectively, you find a hidden panel that allows you access to the device's interior. The tube leads to a central chamber, in which a piece of Bloom-flesh pulses and throbs into various leads.You detach the lump of flesh.

The machine falls silent. The flicker around the room vanishes utterly, and a deep shudder roils the Bloom. The fleshy walls of the shanty groan and push.You hear nails pop from the planks in the floor.

      <DefaultText>The device looks durable, but removing its armored exterior is simple. Once you accomplish that, its interior lies open and vulnerable. A few precise strikes render it worthless, and a few more leave it completely irreparable.

      <DefaultText>Most of this lore is beyond you. You don't know what's useful and what is not. However, as you graze your hand through the interior workings of the machine, you discover a small tube. Examining the tube, you conclude that it contains some sort of device that you may be able to make useful. You pocket it.
