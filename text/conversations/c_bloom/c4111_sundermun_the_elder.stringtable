      <DefaultText>He laughs ruefully. "Because I remember how frustrated I was when the old man wouldn't tell me about the beautiful woman he met. But let me tell you this. She was tall and dark, with eyes that dropped away into eternity. Her voice was the sweetest music, and when she spoke I had to concentrate to get her meaning, because otherwise I'd drift away on the song. Her form was a delight, and we shared a time that - " He breaks off again, blushing. "It was the best time of my life."</DefaultText>
