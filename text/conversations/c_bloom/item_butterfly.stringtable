      <DefaultText>Looking through the glasses, you get a hazy impression of an unfamiliar field. The vision wobbles in an odd way, as if you're seeing through the eyes of something that is flapping around. It makes you so nauseous that you have to remove the glasses.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You get a hazy glimpse of the same field you saw before - or a very similar one. The flapping motion gives you a nauseating sensation of movement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>By the timing of the wingstroke, you would guess the creature to be a butterfly of sorts. It appears to be flapping around, minding its own business, little of worth happening around it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a moment watching through the glasses, you realize the vision is not simply blurred, but seems to foreshadow the butterfly's movement by an instant. In each moment, you are seeing the effects of the butterfly's flaps just before it makes them.

Observing this effect for a while, it seems to you the field is overlaid with a pattern of shadows marking the butterfly's trajectory through space and time. Focusing on different aspects sharpens your view of its immediate future. The understanding this grants is momentary, but powerful.</DefaultText>
