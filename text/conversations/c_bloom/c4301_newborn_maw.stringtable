      <DefaultText>This is clearly another Maw... though its raw, wet flesh suggests that it formed within the past few hours or days. The whispering voices of the Bloom chitter in your ears, and all other sounds fade into the distance.

      <DefaultText>Placing a hand upon the Annulet, you focus on the hissings and chitterings of the Bloom, and they resolve themselves into something that feels more like speech... but isn't. The sound kindles vague impressions of remorse... regret... guilt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A reddened mass of flesh protrudes from the Bloom wall, surrounded by waving tendrils. The flesh is thick and strong, glistening like a newborn beast. A jagged seam runs across its surface, with faint light spilling from within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina lays a hand on your shoulder. "A Maw," whispers Matkina, as if she didn't want to draw its attention. Her voice is wary, respectful. "Those waving tendrils - they're its tongues. The Bloom is focused here. If it likes the smell of you, it'll take a bite." Her mouth quirks a little. "Probably best for our ilk to steer clear."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Satsada's voice emerges from Riastrad's mouth. "Be wary, and do not stand too close. We stand before a Maw, a living doorway to another place. Those tendrils are its organs of perception - its tongues, if you prefer. It will only open if it feeds, and we don't yet know what it wants."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You realize suddenly that this is a Maw. You're not sure *how* you know, but the word leaps into your mind as if you've seen this thing before. The waving tendrils, you know with equal certainty, are its tongues.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Maw remains tightly shut. As you approach, the 'voices' of the Bloom begins to chitter and hiss in your ears.

      <DefaultText>You drive the Scalpel into the Maw's sanguine flesh, and it yields like quivering blubber. Encouraged, you begin hacking through meat and gristle. The Bloom emits a hissing, seething roar, and a wave of almost palpable hatred passes over you. The ground shakes...

      <DefaultText>"I can try," Satsada says. At her word, Riastrad steps toward the Maw, reaching out an unflinching hand to touch the tongues. He remains there for a time, then steps back to your side.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Satsada's voice from Riastrad's lips is soft and nervous. "You had spoken against this."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I *believe* so." Satsada's voice is wary. "The voices are not *sound* at all. Rather, they are psychic emanations of a very particular sort. The Memovira, through her bond with the Bloom, could read those emanations from a distance, but I will need to touch the tongues, and that is a risk." Riastrad swallows. "A risk I would rather not take."

      <DefaultText>Riastrad gives you a quick nod, then turns and takes a step toward the Maw. He reaches out a hand to touch one of the tongues, and he flinches as if burned.

      <DefaultText>"This Maw craves..." Satsada pauses, as if trying to find the words. "Guilt. Remorse. Regret. It wants to draw them out of a person, bit by bit, and feast upon them.

      <DefaultText>"I respect the Bloom. I do not fear it." Satsada stops herself. "No, I *am* afraid. During my servitude under the Memovira, she forced us to watch her feed traitors and prisoners to Maws. She cajoled us into atrocities so that the Bloom would desire us, and then she would use our crimes to open Maws should we defy her. When a Maw begins to feed, it does so *slowly*. It savors its morsels." Riastrad shudders. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The moment your fingers brush the Annulet, your mind makes an instant connection with the Maw, and you feel its desires as if they were your own. This Maw feeds upon *guilt*.

      <DefaultText>Before you break your connection with the Maw, a burst of sensory input flashes through your mind. The Maw's tongues can sense a powerful source of guilt, and it's somewhere in Little Nihliesh.

      <DefaultText>Now that he's moving, he moves with a purpose. He strides into the midst of the tongues, and they reach out for him hungrily. They writhe around him, then fasten upon him. It looks as though they sink *under* his skin without damaging it, and his whole body stiffens. His tattoos respond in kind, racing and skirling across his arms, reaching even to his face. The tattoos seem almost *fearful*.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes snap open, and he focuses on your face, but it's not your face he's seeing. "I am so sorry, my daughter. I didn't mean - I didn't know - "

He lets out an anguished cry and falls to his knees. The Bloom-tongues force their way into his head, and he cries out again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No - NO! Leave the gate buried, you fool. Why would I activate it? My pride is stronger than my sight." He groans, and now his eyes do see you. "Castoff - pull me out. This is too much! Pull me out!"

The Maw remains closed, though.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach past the tongues and seize hold of Aligern's collar. Though the tongues grasp at him and adhere to his skin through his clothes - passing through his clothes without touching them, as if they were only able to touch the substance of the man himself - you are able to drag him free of their clutches. Aligern collapses on the ground when you release him, his eyes wide.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Bloom-tongues reach deeper into Aligern's skull. He twitches and jerks. He reaches out for you, and then his arms fall back to his sides, limp. His eyes roll back into his skull, and he relives a scene of horror.

"I didn't need to open it. Those creatures, tooth and claw, blood and eyes - no! Stop! These are... these are my people..." His screams build until his voice tears, and then they trail out into a whisper. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When at last he sits up, Aligern turns his face to you. Propping himself up on his arms, he wears no expression - not anger, not a threat - and in a dead voice says, "I'll remember this, castoff."

He studies the tattoos on his arms, which have become sluggish and dim, and looks back to you. "Maybe the next Maw will feed on those who betray their companions. It'll open right up for you."</DefaultText>
