      <DefaultText>A washed-out, somewhat insubstantial Artaglio bulls toward you. The boozy cheer has vanished from his red and blotchy face. Now he's a study in fury. Though he seems ghostly, hardly a physical threat, he radiates a nearly palpable heat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You bastard. You utter, conniving bastard. You tricked me into letting the Bloom devour me, and now I get to watch it siphon away the parts of me that were best? I should have known better than to trust a castoff. Make this right. Go on, do it now."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>"You bitch. You rancid, cheating bitch. You tricked me into letting the Bloom devour me, and now I get to watch it siphon away the parts of me that were best? I should have known better than to trust a castoff. Make this right. Go on, do it now."</FemaleText>

      <DefaultText>"Uh huh." He sketches you a sloppy military salute, and he wanders deeper into the Gullet. You have the feeling you'll never see him again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Force spills through you as you pull Artaglio's pain and anguish from him, gathering them into yourself. His emotions feel like knives, and you momentarily relive his horror at being devoured alive, the Maw stripping essential parts of him away as it consigned the rest of him to this slow-devouring hell. 

His pain and fear and suffering wrack you to your very core.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He spits. "No choice? You had plenty of choice. You didn't have to open the Maw. But you did. You did, and you fed me to it. Just like a castoff. Just like all your accursed kin."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Artaglio's face relaxes, softens, and regains some of its accustomed humor.

"It's not so bad, castoff. It's the dying alone that worries me. But now... now I feel like someone will remember me, at least."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His face contorts with rage at your answer. "Needed? This? You call this *help*? You sanctimonious word-slapper!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He backs off in the face of your vehemence, holding his hands up. "Aye, that I did, castoff. That I did. It was my mistake, and my dishonor."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out and place your fingers on Artaglio's chest. He looks surprised but says nothing. You close your eyes, open your mind, and *will* him into the Labyrinth.

Perhaps it's his weakened form, or perhaps it's the strength of your intellect, but you feel his consciousness awakening inside your mind. He's brought his sardonic humor and his taste for rum.

As his mind is reborn inside yours, his body fades in the real world until nothing is left.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He throws himself at you, howling, and for a moment you see the man who was the hero of so many battles in his youth. You throw up your hands to defend yourself, but this isn't a physical attack. His body passes through yours, and you can feel him inside your *mind*, worming his way into the heart of your being.

You feel his angry presence awaken in the Labyrinth. He's achieved a kind of immortality there... or at least a new lease on life.

Ironic that a castoff should grant it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out and place your fingers on Artaglio's chest. He looks surprised but says nothing. You close your eyes, open your mind, and *will* him into the Labyrinth.

After a moment or two, Artaglio clears his throat. "Is this supposed to be doing something?"

He gently removes your fingers from his chest. "You don't need to pretend you can save me from this."

He straightens his clothing. "I'm off to see what the Bloom wants of me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out and place your fingers on Artaglio's chest. He looks surprised, but says nothing. You close your eyes and open your mind, and *will* him into the Labyrinth.

In a moment, you feel his physical body disappearing under your fingers and his mind awakening within yours. A burst of energy from his rejuvenated mind fills your body.

Coincidentally, you really want a mug of rum.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out and place your fingers on Artaglio's chest. He looks surprised, but says nothing. You close your eyes and open your mind, and *will* him into the Labyrinth.

You feel his body dissolving under your fingers, but... where is his mind? Shouldn't you feel him awakening in the Labyrinth right now?

But you don't... and when you open your eyes, Artaglio has vanished completely.

      <DefaultText>He considers your offer. "Got any rum in there?" He smirks. "I'm sure it's better than dying here. Do what you need to do."</DefaultText>
