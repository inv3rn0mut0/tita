You reach in and remove a tiny metal-and-synth sphere.

      <DefaultText>A massive ball spins slowly in the middle of the chamber, its surface scribed with glowing lines. It emanates a low hum, a subtle throb of power, and you can feel your bones aching slightly as you stand near the ball. Coils of light splay out from it and reach toward you - but as one of them nears, you somehow *know* it has no ill intent.

      <DefaultText>This device is hugely valuable. If you can find a way to extract it, Dracogen would likely pay handsomely for it.

{GEORGE: I removed the companion nodes, because if the Cortex is speaking directly to the player, then the companions wouldn't have heard any of this. I can go back to adjust the text to have the Cortex speak out loud, but then we'd need to have Genjes be aware of everything the orb says too.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At last, the orb's power flickers and fades. A panel slides open, revealing a tiny metal-and-synth sphere. If you look closely at it, you can see infinitesimally small patterns traced along its surface, with miniscule lights racing here and there along and through those patterns.
