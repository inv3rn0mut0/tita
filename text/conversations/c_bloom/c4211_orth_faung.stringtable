      <DefaultText>You see a tall, nervous man, pacing back and forth. His hair is a mess, his clothing stained with food and chemicals. His left eye is an engraved orb of metal, and you can hear it whirring from a distance. He casts fretful glances all around the space, as if waiting for someone or something.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aligern! I heard you were in the Bloom, but I didn't dare come to look for you." He looks around anxiously.

"I had a revelation about your tattoos as I was examining the frame, and if I could just compare the windings of your tattoos with the circuitry of the frame, I could verify my hypothesis... unfortunately, murdens stole the frame and I have no idea where it is. Did you get my note?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks you over nervously, and then his gaze narrows. "You were the one who was traveling with Aligern, yes? I sent him a note, and I heard that he had been seen in the company of a man with a tattoo on the side of his head. If you see him, can you tell him that his colleague Orth Faung has some intriguing news for him?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I studied that frame for years. *Years*. The more I studied it, the more concerned I was about the effects that I might trigger if I were to activate it somehow. With Aligern's village of Ormen as my first data point, I thought perhaps I should remove myself to someplace where the effects might be less... disastrous."

"Yes," he whispers. "Yes. Yes!"

He grabs Aligern and kisses his friend full on the mouth.

"My friend, I forbid you to use your tattoos anymore. Unless...." He pauses, clearly building for dramatic effect. "Unless you enjoy throwing your family and friends!"
