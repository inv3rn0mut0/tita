      <DefaultText>The little Maws converge on you, some of their tendrils holding you immobile while others tear great chunks from your flesh and toss them into the glowing singularities at their core. You scream. All around you, the Bloom responds with excited and gleeful whispers.

The sounds of brutal feasting are the last thing you hear as darkness claims you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When at last you awaken, the horrible creatures are gone, and it feels as if a piece of you is missing. A quick inventory of your body reveals nothing missing, but you cannot shake the sense that you are somehow diminished.
