      <DefaultText>"What do *you* want?" His ugly scowl deepens. "I saw you in my mind. You *violated* me! Forced me to betray Paj and the First!"

His grip tightens on his blade. "I'll see you dead for that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What do *you* want?" His ugly scowl deepens. "I saw you in my mind. You *controlled* me, kept me from erasing her mind."

His grip tightens on his blade. "But... you betrayed her anyway. Why?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He leers at her. "This isn't all you've forgotten, you know. I've been sapping your mind since we first met. You made it so easy - always willing to believe what you *hoped* instead of what *was*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He blinks, staring for a long time. "You really believe that, don't you?"

He glances over at the First. "She's always done what's necessary, too - even slaughtering castoffs..."

He turns back and nods. "I believe you. I'll help you stop her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're a bastard, Tash, always were." Her weapon twists in her hand. "When you're down, I'm going to carve pieces out of your brain, just like you did to me."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>He growls, his scowl deepening. "Oh, we're already even on that score, Matkina. Your *master* penetrated my brain and twisted it like dough - he made me do things I didn't want to do and then be *happy* about it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is that what you think he did? He *saved* me Tash, the only way anyone could have. He did what he had to do."

Her expression suddenly softens. "It's *your* master you should be worried about. She's blind to anything but her goal, oblivious to the costs along the way. Whether she means to or not, she'll *kill* us if she gets her way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He blinks, staring for a long time. "You really believe that, don't you?"

He glances over at the First. "She's always done what's necessary, too - even slaughtering castoffs..."

He turns back and nods. "Maybe you're right. I'll stop her. But this *doesn't* make you and me square, hear?"</DefaultText>
