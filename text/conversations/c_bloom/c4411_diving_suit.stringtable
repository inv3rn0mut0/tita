{Colin: I'm thinking the first examine just offers environmental info of the suit, while a deeper examine for a second lootable is skill based. But please setup skill checks as you see fit.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There are a number of tools and strange devices attached to the suit's right hand. You might be able to extract one or two of these, if you're careful.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Most of the attachments are broken or corroded, but through some careful maneuvering, you're able to detach something that looks like a spray canister. A test squirt produces a glob of quick-drying, liquid synth... a highly-effective sealant.

Once you detach the device, you notice that there's more machinery deeper inside the suit's arm.</DefaultText>

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>You reach into the arm, and your fingers graze a small metal orb. You carefully pry it loose and withdraw it from the arm. It looks like you've found a reservoir of the sealant material used in the spray device.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel around in the alien machinery, but most of the components are impossible to understand or identify, and you don't find anything of value.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach in, carefully, and your fingers graze a small metal orb. You finagle it carefully from its socket... it looks like you've found a reservoir of the material used in the sprayer device. You might be able to use this as a kind of detonation!

      <DefaultText>Again you plunge your hand into the alien machinery, but this time, you inadvertently activate something within. A small reservoir of sealant explodes inside the arm, encasing the interior in hard synth. You manage to pull your hand out in time, but you won't be able to salvage any more components.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Some visitant lived inside this suit, a creature with multiple eyes scattered across its face, based on the skeletal remains you can see inside. At least, you assume they're eye sockets - they might have been some other alien orifice. Oddly, the creature had no visible mouth or jaw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Will you look at that! I've heard of these vivaric armatures before, but I've never seen one in the flesh. Other Aeon Priests have found them all over the world. We're - they're - not sure what these are for, but they've been known to carry some serious weaponry." He catches you looking at him and immediately dampens his enthusiasm. "If you care about that sort of thing, I mean."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her echoes look back and forth at one another, and Callistege smiles. "It's a vivaric armature, pets, isn't it? Who knew that we could find such a thing here?" At your glance, she continues, "The learned and the lucky have found these suits throughout the world. None know their purpose, but they carry some impressive devices, if you know how to extract them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first you're not sure what you're looking at. It seems to be an enormous suit of metal armor, or perhaps some sort of... exploration suit. It's large - at least twice the size of an ordinary human - and its limbs and joints are completely foreign to you. Even if you could somehow find a way inside, you'd have to contort yourself in ways the human body was never meant to bend.

It has a visor or faceplate at its top.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The strange metal of this suit looks as if it could survive the cold of the interstellar void or the depths of an impossibly deep sea. When you push on it, it gives just a little bit, and expands by the same amount. 

The Bloom-flesh around the suit is puffy and irritated, almost infected. It seems that the Bloom is trying to absorb the suit into itself... without much success.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your careful examination pays off. Near the faceplate, you find a small, detachable lens. It may have been used to focus beams of light or some other visible force. You detach it carefully and store it away.
