      <DefaultText>The flat, processed voice seems to contain a hint of elation. "Each recruit is removed to a place of safety, to the Optero Suite. Once there, our team of dedicated preservers will begin the process of separating its head from its body. The body will be saved for use for our nobility. We will likely discard the head, unless the recruit demonstrates some aptitude for work such as that which I perform."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Excellent. We require but one more recruit to reach the quota set for our mission here. Should you provide this recruit for us, you will be handsomely paid as usual. As well, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that the subjects' bodies will experience greater pleasure or satisfaction than anything they could have found here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The grille buzzes out its flat voice again. "We do not have a personal appellation you would understand. Your people commonly refer to ours as 'Decanted'. We achieve long life through these forms you see, our heads separated and preserved. We need not retain our original forms to preserve the knowledge we carry. We can shed these bodies but live on. This one has lived hundreds of years, though its original body is long since dust."</DefaultText>
