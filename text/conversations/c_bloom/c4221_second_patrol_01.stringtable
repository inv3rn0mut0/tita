      <DefaultText>When he realizes that you're not a murden, his eyes light with frantic hope. "Oh, thank the gods you've come. If you can free me and my colleague, you can name your reward with Brusca, with the Memovira herself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've been on this route for a long time. A very long time. We've never had any trouble with the murdens before - they've always paid for the privilege before, so we had no reason to think... to think they'd just try to slaughter us. We fought back, and we survived the fight, but..." He gestures to his dead companion. "I don't know how much longer he'll make it. We need your help to escape."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's a key by the door, friend," he says. "Just use that and... excellent," he finishes as you unlock him and his friend. "Can I trouble you for something else? With the shape Zebbak is in, there's no way we can get out of here alive... at least, not with the murden guards watching the entryway. Can you do something about them?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They give us some bowls of slop now and then, but I don't dare eat it. If I used it as a chamber pot you'd never know the difference. Otherwise, they ignore Zebbak and me. I mean, if you don't count the time when they came in here and ate pieces off Pehle. They're keeping us fresh, is what I think, instead of letting us rot. Our turn'll come. I'm sure of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nudges his companion, and both of them look at you with hope in their pain-filled eyes. "Is the way clear? Did you get rid of the murden guards at the entrance?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's a key on the hook by the door. I assumed they were using it to taunt us, but now I think they're really just... thank you," he finishes as you unlock him. "I think they're just stupid and don't want to forget where they put the key when they get ready to eat me. All right. I hate to ask for more help, but I can't get away cleanly if the murdens are still in the hall. Can you... clear them out? Somehow?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two men share this cell. Both of them wear the armor of the Memovira's soldiers. A third soldier lies on the ground nearby, lifeless.

One of the survivors is badly hurt, bleeding and clutching his side. The other - a younger man - appears uninjured. His hands are bound with rusty manacles, and he looks blearily up at you with eyes that suggest that he's waiting for the butcher's blade. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This man is not as badly hurt as the corpses nearby, but neither could he be called healthy. He is beaten and bruised, his clothing is torn, and dried blood crusts his nose and clothing. His hands are bound with rusty manacles, and he looks blearily up at you with eyes that suggest that he's waiting for the butcher's blade. 

He wears the garb of the Memovira's guard.</DefaultText>
