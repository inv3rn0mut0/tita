      <DefaultText>This massive crystalline structure looks like a shrine of some sort. Colored lights float about inside, each one like a tiny galaxy trapped within the crystal.

As you approach, the crystal begins to hum. The resonations shake your skull. The humming shifts and increases until you hear a voice.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Revel-" The bright voice echoes directly in your mind. It stutters, uncertain, like someone trying to remember how to speak.

"G-greetings, Patterned One. I am the Speaker. Welcome to the Ascension of Kex-Lianish. I am sorry, but the Oracle no longer exists."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You are standing on it! Or rather what remains of it. The Kex-Lianish built the Oracle to answer the most difficult questions of existence." The voice grows wistful.

"Then the Lianish left. The Oracle remained for a hundred thousand years or so, before it... broke down, I suppose. All that's left of the Oracle are the phobits."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lights dance within the crystal in a manner you can only interpret as proud. "*We* are the phobits. The sparkling lights you see inside some of the crystals. If the Oracle was a brain, then we were its neurons. Each one of us had our own job, our own specialization."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A few of the lights pull together, creating a glowing circle in the air - no, not a circle. A pentagon like your tattoo. "Patterns are what we *do*, Patterned One. *Life* is pattern, and your life more than most. Your thoughts hold a certain shape - a shape I've seen before."

The lights twirl and chime wistfully. "A man came through here long ago. He did some work here, I believe. Or maybe came to hide something or find something. He never revealed to me his true purpose."</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I apologize, but I do not. Investigation was not my specialization, only speaking."

The crystal vibrates once. The deep voice speaks. "Revelation. The Speaker can speak to *all* sentients, even those that did not exist at the time of its creation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course, but they know nothing. I don't see what interpreting would..."

The Speaker trails off, pulsing thoughtfully. "No, there *is* a way they can help. Several phobits in the area were in charge of transmission tracts - communication pathways connecting the Oracle's smaller subsystems. When the Oracle passed, those pathways became obsolete and their phobits quiescent. But those tracts *could* serve as bridges to help you explore the area."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lights inside the crystal dim slightly. "I do not trust them. They don't... taste right." You hear a sound in your mind remarkably like a clucking tongue. "I cannot explain it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Revelation," the Speaker adds, above a chorus of brittle snaps from within its body. "One of the humans nearby is not alone in his own mind. There are two patterns of thought where there should be one. Be careful around this human."

The Speaker's light dims. "The Oracle has Spoken."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My full title was once 'the Speaker for the Oracle of Kex-Lianish.'" It says the name with soft reverence. "I heard questions from pilgrims, relayed them to the Oracle, and then conveyed the Oracle's answer via revelation. I gave wisdom to this entire world." The crystal's light dims. "Now I speak for no one, and I have few answers to give."

The deeper voice speaks again. "Revelation. When the Speaker dreams, it dreams of weeping. Sometimes, the tears are made of light. Others, tiny black gems."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have no idea!" It sounds almost cheery about it. "You see? Eons ago, even though I had no thoughts of my own, I could have given you answers about life, the universe, and... you know, whatever. Now I'm just a voice. A friendly voice, but still."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You can't speak to the others, of course. That is to say, they're perfectly intelligent, but they are entirely unaware of you. The only reason you and I can speak is because of my role as Speaker. The others weren't made for communication or perception."

The Speaker throbs. The deep voice cuts into the air. "Revelation. Common phobits were used to store activation states and simple information. Some may still react to basic, physical stimuli."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The thoughts you receive from the structure are not like any thoughts you have experienced before.

      <DefaultText> The lights pulse once, then a much deeper voice emanates from the crystal. "Revelation. The Oracle was immortal. Time was the weapon that killed her."

Something clicks - or cracks - within the crystal, and it speaks with the bright voice again. "I regret that without the Oracle, I will have very few answers for you. But I will do what I can."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You are mistaken. Speakers are not authorized to grant revelations without the Oracle's permission, and the Oracle is no more."

You hear another *crack* from deep within the crystal, as harsh as ice breaking underfoot. The deep voice speaks again, "Revelation. The Speaker cannot hear itself give revelations."

It stutters and falls silent for a moment before saying in the bright voice, "I wish that I *did* have some revelations for you, Patterned One. Alas, that time is long past."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>Several sharp clacks resound within the crystal. The deeper voice says, "Revelation. The phobits were not always sentient. Cogitation. Would they have become so if the Oracle had not chosen disintegration?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The deep voice booms. "Revelation. Like humans, the Lianish also required physical structures for traversal. Only a few phobits specialize in areas requiring this knowledge. The Speaker is not among them."

The Speaker's bright voice returns. "Try to interact with the phobits. When you do, I'll ask them to activate or deactivate. They may not all be as helpful as we'd like, but I think you'll figure some way to get around."</DefaultText>
