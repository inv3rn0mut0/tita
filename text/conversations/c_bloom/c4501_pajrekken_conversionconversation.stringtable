      <DefaultText>Paj's face is a mask of carefully controlled anger. "You. You're like an insect. You'll survive anything, when someone like Aadiriis..." She looks away and swallows before she turns back.

Her eyes harden. "But we've got you where we want you. Now we'll stop the Coward's plan for good."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She whispers, "I have served Maralel faithfully for centuries. But... she has grown too arrogant. Too full of herself. She doesn't remember what it means to love anyone. And... and I believe she would sacrifice all of us to win this gambit."

She blows out hard, and uncurls her clenched fist. "I am on your side. Do not disappoint me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She clenches her teeth. "I have served Maralel faithfully for centuries. I have trusted her judgment in all that time, even at great personal cost. I will continue to do so. You and I - we are foes to the end. That's how it has to be."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What? I would never have done that. Never! It was you who weakened the shields, you who..." She clamps her mouth shut. Her next words are slow and measured. "The Sorrow attacked after I told Maralel you were there. But... the shields still stood after I left."

She pinches the bridge of her nose. "If it wasn't you, and it wasn't me... the truth begins to dawn."</DefaultText>
