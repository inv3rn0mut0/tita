      <DefaultText>Coty wields a broom and wears strange new clothes. They don't suit him, but at least he isn't dead.

He looks up. "Hey, you came back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Coty glances from her to you. "Why?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hey." Coty waves you over. "I heard Miss Speck say that maw wants some kind of predator. There's this... guy, I guess, down in the courtyard. I heard the other slaves talking about him. They call him Waits-for-Prey."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "It's fine, I guess. I don't have to sleep on the street or steal my food."

He leans in closer. "But these people are weird, and Miss Speck watches me *all the time*. The folks who come in are even weirder. They don't smell good. At all."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What?" He struggles to keep his voice down. "You're going to steal the *offerings*? You vouched for me. What if she catches you and thinks we're working together?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks at the offering table. His eyes grow wide, and he whispers, "You're going to *take* something, aren't you? What if she catches you? She'll think you and I are working together!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You told me the Bloom is not a god, even though I was handing my life to it. I knew you were right, then. I'm not sure *they* do."

He pulls back, no longer whispering. "Though I guess I'm grateful. I was like them, in a way, and you saw it and called me on it. Thanks, I guess."</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>Coty looks at you, and you see the resignation in his eyes again. "I can't say it's gone. Some nights, I lay awake for hours, scared of seeing her in my dreams."

He shudders, then adds. "But there's enough work that I don't have to think about it most days. Sometimes, I even think I'll be all right."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, no, it's fine!" He glances quickly at the Speck, whose attention seems to be elsewhere for the moment. "I mean, it's a job, right? It could be worse." He takes a deep breath. "It could be a *lot* worse. Th-thank you. Really."</DefaultText>
