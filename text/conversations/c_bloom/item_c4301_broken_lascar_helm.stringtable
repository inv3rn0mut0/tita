      <DefaultText>You examine the helm more closely. It gleams underneath the crusted filth, worked with a skill unmatched in this age. Its crest seems to contain a number of dark black cells that catch and hold the light. Fine traceries in the cells look as if they might gather or disperse energies. It looks as if you could fit it on your head.</DefaultText>

From within, a female voice speaks softly in a foreign tongue, musical but harsh. After a few moments, she pauses, and then speaks again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though the words are spoken in the language of the Truth, they are strangely accented... and filled with growing alarm. Listening to the words, you piece together the speaker's last moments: greeting a stranger - or a group of them - and discovering their murderous intent. Her skull fractured, she bled to death slowly, her body hidden in one of the trash heaps of the Bloom. It's a wonder no one has found this helm until now.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dark and padded interior has some faintly glowing nodules and soft synth fibers, but no visible eye-slits or breathing apparatus. More importantly, the helm has been collecting rotting garbage and debris for what looks like decades, and as you scoop out the sodden mass, you discover fragmented bone - possibly that of the previous owner. 

You clean the helm as best you can.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The helm was clearly custom-designed for a specific person's head, but you can fit it around your skull with some fierce tugging. The odor of decomposition fills your nostrils, as well as the accumulated filth of the Bloom's trash.

It is pitch black in the helm. No eye-slits or breathing apparatus are immediately apparent to you, but after a few seconds, a small light begins to blink in the corner of your visual field.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You lift the helm to place it over your head, and as you settle it down, a horrific organic goo pours out onto your head, followed immediately thereafter by some calciferous material.

You hastily pull the helmet away and scrape the residue from your hair, discovering that fragments of the previous owner's fractured skull are still stuck to the lining inside, and that the juices of the midden heap have seeped inside.

You clean out the helm as best you can.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Among the many images here, you see several that depict places you have been, though their particulars have changed since these images were captured. You suspect that years have passed.

The first image is of the vast interior chamber, its pathways and tendrils sprawling across the empty spaces. You see foul gases curling from the depths, a row of shops and upwardly-built homes, and caravans pulled by aneen traversing the strands.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The final images in this collection depict Little Nihliesh... but not as you know it. Most of the people you see are ordinary humans. Gar-koto's great tank is nowhere to be seen. The piles of trash are smaller, and the ancient stone buildings still serve as habitations. Though an aura of squalor and disrepair taints the place, and you can almost smell the garbage, it seems nearly idyllic in comparison to current reality. These images must be at least a decade old.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When you look at the first image, it expands outward again, showing a vast grid of other sights. Clearly, the owner of the helm took great care in recording the images of the Ninth World's sky. Either she loved the stars desperately... or she was collecting these shots to cross-reference with some other collection.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pulsing, moist walls of the Bloom form the backdrop of all these images, so your guess is that the helm's original owner met each of these people during their visit here.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see Dracogen's tall form looming over a smaller man. Dracogen's smile is sharp and fierce, and the threat implicit in the way he holds himself tells you that he is about to exact some punishment on his quaking client. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The next array of images shows the Observant Speck, who looks exactly the same as she does in the current time. The diminutive woman is gesturing dramatically, probably in the midst of telling a story, an animated arm and coy smile shining through the static picture.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The next images show (from a distance) the distinctive outline of Waits-for-prey, its spikes and blades held in a threatening pose. Some unfortunate challenger is facing the construct, her electrified blade looking pitifully inadequate to the task.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Closer examination of the interior suggests that it connects with its wearer through eye-movement tracking. Once it synchronizes with the eye movement, the helm's internal circuitry develops a direct neural connection with its user. You suspect that it might also store past users' experiences and observations.

      <DefaultText>As your eye automatically flickers to it, the helmet's air clears, degassing the foul stench, and you can feel the air circulating from hidden pumps inside the headpiece. Several unfamiliar symbols light up on the right side of your visual field. Most are dim, but one symbol shines brightly. If you had to guess, the dim symbols mark functions that are unavailable at this time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The courtyard outside the Memovira's fortress seems subtly different, and you look at it for a moment before two observations strike you.

First, the uniforms of the guards are quite different from those who serve the current Memovira. 

You also notice that this image was taken from where the catena's wreckage sits now. The area still looks as dingy and dangerous, but the lack of the catena makes the space seem more open, less oppressed. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The next image is of the Bloom, seen from a path descending from Sagus Cliffs. Though you already had some sense of its immensity, its massive bulk momentarily takes your breath away. Wedged into the cleft between two massive escarpments, the Bloom is both wide and long, with taut and massive tendrils anchored to the rock face. It looks as if the creature is dragging itself toward the inland sea... very, very slowly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The final image is that of three human men. One of them holds aloft a jagged piece of stronglass, its end bloodied. The owner of the helm holds up a hand to ward off another blow. Blood gouts in the air.</DefaultText>
