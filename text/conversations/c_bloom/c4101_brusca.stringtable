My apologies for your loss, sir."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Both of the patrols were tasked with collecting duties from the gangs. They're probably somewhere in the Vast Interior or one of the slums, but I haven't heard from them in some time. Given the nature of the Bloom, they could literally be anywhere."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She makes a brusque signal to the guard next to her. He slips inside the fortress, then emerges almost immediately and nods to her.

"So it's true! Sorry about that. A lot of chagans here think they've got the shine to see her without an invitation. Most of my job is keeping them out."

She gestures toward the gate with the hilt of her blade. "The guards will escort you inside."</DefaultText>
