      <DefaultText>This young man's beauty shines even through his grimy face and his tattered clothes. His eyes are wide and staring, electric blue, and the movements his fingers trace through the air look like birds in flight. He snaps out of his reverie and grins at you, his teeth even and white against his brown skin.

On closer examination, you can see that his rags were once fine fabrics, carefully and expertly stitched.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He greets you with an easy familiarity, like an old companion. His voice is smooth and educated, mellifluous and soft.

"Hello, friend. My name is Bourras! Can you spare [Global: c4211_BourrasDonation] shins?"

      <DefaultText>He sketches a friendly salute. "Hello again, f-f-friend. Sheen's essences are top-notch today. I can hear her in there muttering, and that's always a good sign for me. It means she has something special brewing." An idea strikes him: "*You* should try her essences. They'll change your life."

He stops for a moment. "But wait until after I've bought m-mine, all right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks up, his ready grin faltering and dying as he sees your face. "Oh. It's y-y-you. Why do you keep coming back here to talk to me if you don't plan to help me? Do you f-f-feed on misery? What's *that* like? Come on. Give me some shins."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did... did you say 'f-f-free'?" His eyes light up with a childish enthusiasm. "Friend, I wish I could stay to speak with you longer, but I have urgent business to attend to. Namely, I need to p-procure some of these samples before people who won't ap-appreciate them like I do!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"F-f-free? Oh my. Oh my." He starts to pat down his rags to make sure he has everything, and he even begins to take a few steps toward the exit before he stops, and he slouches back to his position. "You know, the l-l-last time I left for a free sample, I was set upon and robbed. The time before that, someone injected me with living sound. I... I don't trust free."</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh my goodness! F-f-free? Then I won't be needing to pawn these!" He claps you on the shoulder with one hand and with the other deposits a pulsing mass of green gobbets into your hand. They drip and ooze, and you can feel the heat coming from them. "I'm sure you'll find a way to make them work!"

And with that, he's off.

      <DefaultText>"No. No. N-no!" He is shaking his head hard. He slaps it a couple times to make his point. "I learned not to trust the f-f-free samples. I learned it the hardest way - by actually experiencing it. In a way that I remember is my own life. I won't do that again."

He pauses and looks away from you, and then mutters, "I remember that I shouldn't trust people who tell me about f-f-free samples, too."

      <DefaultText>Bourras hasn't gotten better - if anything, he's worse. His mouth is open and drooling, and his eyes are focused on a different reality. His fingers twitch and he sways slightly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why? *Why*? Friend, do you remember the first time you fell in love? The sweet laughter of an infant? Th-th-the taste of a tear when you hear of a friend's death? I do. I remember them even though they haven't happened to me." He stops, puzzlement crossing his face. "At least, I don't think they have. But no matter! Here, inside this shop, Sheen sells the essence of those experiences. If you have the shins, you can live them all yourself!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You find a bare handful of shins and some gooey green pellets that are disgustingly alive and warm to the touch. They dissolve at your touch, coating your hands temporarily with slime.

      <DefaultText>Bourras gazes off into the distance, his mind trapped in some inner reminiscence. His body twitches and shakes, as if he were dreaming of some major accomplishment. He does not respond to your words.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you begin to move off, he suddenly comes to himself. "I am so sorry. Were you standing there long? My mind is wandering into strange places. I don't know what's happening."

He takes stock of himself. "I need a doctor. Do you think Demeray and Obervich can help me? Well, no, wait. They ask for payment up front, and I'm skinned." He looks at you shyly. "I hate to ask, but you've been so generous. Can you help me get well?"</DefaultText>
