      <DefaultText>This egg-shaped object is made of pearly white synth. The moment you touch it, a lively tune begins to play. It's a bright and cheerful sound, a melody that a child might enjoy... and one that's likely to get stuck in your head. 

You notice that the egg has adhered to your hands.

      <DefaultText>When you touch the egg, you can hear the cheerful, silly tune again. As before, it adheres to your hands, preventing you from accidentally dropping it.

An image reappears on the surface of the egg.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> "Indeed! A heroic march, beckoning me onward to do heroic things! But I *always* hear that song. Because I'm the hero." Erritis pats your shoulder. "Perhaps you're hearing the *sidekick* song."

      <DefaultText> "I don't hear anything." Rhin reaches out and touches a finger to the egg, then jerks it away with a look of disgust. "Ugh! I heard it just then. It reminds me of... egg custard with too much sugar."

      <DefaultText>You peer more closely at the smooth, white surface of the egg. At once, an image takes shape, as if the egg itself is a viewscreen. It's a bird's eye view of... you! 

In the image, you're holding the egg, gazing into it. All around you, little creatures dance and caper. They're the size and shape of toddlers, covered in pastel fur of mauve, orange, or baby blue, with huge, lustrous eyes and wide, furry ears. They begin to sing along with the music. You don't understand the words, but their voices are high-pitched and full of excitement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The little creatures sing louder, grabbing hold of each other and twirling themselves around, cooing and giggling. Then one of them seems to notice you. It playfully pokes at your leg, and you can *feel* it... a second creature wraps your other leg in a big bear hug, and you can feel that, too. They squeal with delight.

A third creature with bright orange fur jumps up and down in front of you, holding out its little hands like a child who wants to be picked up.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You lean toward where the creature's head should be and reach out one hand. Sure enough, you can feel its soft fur and the firmness of its flesh. You scratch the top of its head, and it purrs contentedly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stretch out one of your hands, and the little creature clambers up your arm, giggling. On the surface of the egg, you can see it clinging to your body, pulling at your clothes and your hair. Even though the creature isn't visible in the real world, you can feel the pressure of its little hands, and you can hear its laughter - even its breath - close to your ears.

After a few moments, the little orange creature tires of its game and leaps off your shoulder with a woop.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Another little creature appears at the edge of the scene. Its fur is bright pink, with tufts of green protruding from its ears. It isn't dancing or playing. Instead, it's watching the others while bobbing up and down to the beat of the music. 

One of the little creatures capers past. The pink creature extends its arms for a dance. "Eeee!" the other squeals with joy.

The pink creature takes hold of its arm and tears it from its socket.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, the little victim is shrieking in pain as the pink creature tears it to pieces, shoving limbs and steaming entrails into its mouth. The victim's head survives longer than it should, and it's still screaming when the pink creature yanks out its eyes, pops them into its mouth, and smashes the head to pulp.

When it has finished, the pink creature looks directly at you - not the version of you in the image but the *real* you, watching from the viewscreen on the egg. It smiles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You concentrate, driving the instinctual fear from your mind, willing yourself to close your eyes. One eye twitches, then the other, and suddenly, the spell is broken. You jam your eyes shut and turn away from the egg. 

For a moment, you can hear the pink creature shrieking in fury, followed by a terrible rending sound... then silence. 

You cautiously open your eyes again... without looking directly at the egg.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>None of the other creatures seem to have noticed what happened to their playmate. They still romp and frolic about, singing their incomprehensible song. 

The pink creature dances over to another unsuspecting victim. It's the little orange fellow who was so excited to play with you earlier. This time, the pink creature rips open the other's belly and thrusts its head inside, feasting on the victim's innards while it wails piteously and thrashes about.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Finally, the other creatures *do* notice what's happening. They scream in terror, throwing up their little hands and scattering in all directions until they've vanished from sight.

With a happy little burp, the pink creature tears apart what's left of its second victim, leaving skin and fur in a shredded pile on the ground. Then it walks up to you and takes a bite out of your leg. The pain is *real* - and so is the wound - but your scream catches in your throat, and you don't make a sound.</DefaultText>

Without warning, another sharp pain tears through you. The creature sinks its teeth into the flesh of your back, ripping out a hunk of flesh, chewing contentedly and swallowing before resuming its leisurely climb.</DefaultText>
