      <DefaultText>You waken on the cold floor of the Memovira's fortress. When you open your eyes, vertigo assails you, and a momentary panic when you realize the Sorrow hovers here, its tendrils coiling and twisting.

You sit up. The detritus of the battle surrounds you, but you feel a quietness in the room, a lack. It takes you a moment, and then you realize - the First is gone, as are all her allies. Not just dead, but vanished utterly.</DefaultText>

He tears at his hair, his face, his eyes, his fingers dragging bloody furrows across his forearms as he tries to scratch his tattoos from his skin. They writhe and scream and fall hissing from his arms, and for a moment they flicker into a nearly-human shape.

Ghostly, multi-colored streamers coruscate around him, bedeviling him, and at last he falls to the ground, twitching. He is not dead, though death might be a kindness.
