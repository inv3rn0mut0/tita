      <DefaultText>The two merchants turn toward you. One is a heavyset human with a large head and a wide, bony face. The other is a particularly thin and sickly-looking varjellen. Its head crest is decorated with symbols that are unknown to you. Both are dressed in rich clothing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach the two merchants, you notice that the human is red-faced and fuming. The veins all over his large head look ready to burst. 

"The Bloom..." he sputters. "Now it's devouring our wagon!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ha! I never thought we'd free that wagon!" The human merchant grins like a madman and does a little jig, his massive head lolling back and forth like a pendulum.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hope you weren't planning to visit the Ascension, friend," says the human, whose face is set in a permanent frown. "The only road was in there." He gestures toward the massive jaw that has closed over the far end of the platform.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As we approach, the entrance grows teeth," says the emaciated varjellen. It speaks with a strange, halting accent, as if the Truth is not its native tongue. "The teeth get big and turn into a great jaw. Down it comes, swift and cruel. All this happens fast, in time it takes to walk five steps."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The human grimaces. "The Bloom's good for three things, friend. Farting up smoke to burn our eyes, pissing foul water for us to drink, and eating whoever and whatever it likes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Where else? The Ascension has its own perils, but it's blessed with a bounty of useful things. Unlike this place. Try getting anyone to pay for a hunk of quivering Bloom-flesh." The merchant scowls and spits. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We trade in crystals from Ascension-place. Good business there. Bad business here." The varjellen attempts to scowl and spit in the same manner as its friend, but it only manages to spray the front of its garment with a bluish fluid from its nose-slits.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A world made of crystal. Like this." The varjellen plucks a finger-sized gemstone from its pocket. It seems to quiver of its own accord, as if it's alive. "All things in Ascension made of crystal. Living creatures too. It is a cold and dark place. The sun is too small in the sky."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All things in Ascension made of crystal. Even living creatures, they too are crystal. It is cold and dark and the sun is small." The varjellen bobs its head. "Very dangerous if you walk too far from the gate."</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You mean Grisseler?" The human gives you a sour look. "He brought us safely through the well-traveled courtyard and across the many perilous meters of this platform. A gifted explorer indeed." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Many speak well of the Grissel-man," the varjellen points out. "They say the Bloom *likes* him, if such a thing can be."</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>The merchant eyes Grisseler. "I've *heard* things about him. They say he can walk wherever he pleases in the Bloom... that doors will open for him if he really wants to go somewhere. And if you get him angry, he'll just *appear* when you're lost or alone and tear open your throat for you."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>He snorts derisively, but you notice that he keeps his voice low. "Probably nonsense. He hasn't opened any doors for *us*." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not yet. We offer salts and dyes and alchemical powders to our 'contact' in the Ascension. He... it... whatever it is... absorbs what it likes and gives us crystalline artifacts in return. If we ever manage to get there, *then* I might have something to trade."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You could try that flesh merchant on the next platform." He turns to his companion. "What's his name again?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sunder-mun. His name is Sunder-mun." The varjellen bobs its head each time it speaks the name. "Two men he is, but also one."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his ponderous head. "If we ever reach the Ascension, we'll have something of value to sell. Crystalline numenera of all shapes and sizes. Never the same things twice."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Grissel-man asks us to go with him into depths of the Bloom, seek out other mouths... jaws...  maws that lead to Trade Post. We are not stupid. We say no." The varjellen twists its face into a deep frown in a remarkable imitation of its companion. Clearly it has been practicing.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>The merchant snorts. "Better for you, perhaps, if you're young and poor and eager to die. We are none of those things." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes. He also hears its voice in his head and brags of being devoured three times. He's not going anywhere unless *we're* there to watch him." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>The merchant raises a bushy eyebrow. "That's charitable of you... which makes me assume you have some nefarious motive. But pay it no mind, I have a pessimistic nature."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>The merchant scowls. "Until we have a better plan... or the Bloom eats the whole damn platform." He suddenly appears uneasy, as if the mere suggestion of such a thing has made it possible.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I found a back way into the Trade Post through a Maw in Chiurgeon Slump."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hrmm. Maws are unpredictable at best. And getting our wagon over to the Slump - without being robbed by murdens - seems a questionable prospect." The merchants glance at each other. "We'll... think on it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>The human merchant nods a greeting, though he looks just as unhappy as before. A moment later, his varjellen companion does the same, imitating him as precisely as it can.</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>The human merchant grinds his teeth in fury as the wagon sinks deeper into the Bloom-flesh. "Isn't the Memovira supposed to *prevent* things like this? Why else do we pay her for trading rights?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>Surprised, the merchant sizes you up with a glance. "Maybe you can. We've been trying to pull the wagon free and getting nowhere, but another pair of arms might make the difference."</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>Surprised, the merchant sizes you up with a glance. "I doubt it. We've been pulling with all our might, and you don't look like you have the strength to do better. But you're welcome to try."</DefaultText>

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>His varjellen companion nods its head sadly. Its head crest sags, giving an impression of supreme dejection. "We save a few things. Only as much as we carry with hands." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The human tosses you a little clay jar. "You can have that, if you like. It's some kind of worthless powder, but the floating megalith... or whatever it was... that we met in the Ascension always liked it. We're finished with this trade, so it's no use to us."
