      <DefaultText> "And what is this?" a friendly voice booms. Opening your bleary eyes, you see an earnest, gray-skinned non-human with a toothy smile. He is tall and wide across the shoulders, and exudes great strength. His hands terminate in long claws. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He'll give that Merecaster to the player - and also introduce the player to the Memovira, who has the other Merecasters - but only if the player does a service for him. He wants the Magmatic Annulet from a place called the Ascension. This bestows "Dracogen's Price." Dracogen tells the player that the portal leading to the Ascension can be accessed from a nearby Trade Post. (Player's first quest objective is to go to the Trade Post.)</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A Maw is one of the many mouths of the Bloom, reaching through the dimensions." He looks at your face, and answers your unspoken question. "The Bloom is a living entity of incredible power, both physically and psychically, which is why it's able to hold back the Sorrow. Some enterprising individuals travel these tendrils, exploring the new dimensions and bringing back strange and wondrous items for trade here. Sometimes, the Maws close, cutting off those dimensions. That's where you come in."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a huge, hyper-dimensional creature that people live in. People travel the tendrils through the Maws the Bloom creates, and they bring back interesting wares. But the Maws are closing now, and the Memovira is trying to consolidate her power. That's why I need you to do this job for me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He swells with momentary pride. "I am Dracogen. I'm the man who can find what you need, even if you don't know you need it. I deal in information, and I pay those who work for me handsomely. Ask anyone here, and they'll tell you I trade fairly. You might also ask them what happens to those who try to cross me. But I don't think that our relationship starts best with threats. Instead, I'll say that if you do something for me, I can give you a Merecaster and an introduction to the Memovira."</DefaultText>
