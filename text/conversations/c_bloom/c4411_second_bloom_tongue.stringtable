      <DefaultText>At the moment, the Maw's attention is riveted upon the Callistege-echoes who lurk glumly nearby. One of those echoes is a trap, a lure, created by the Maw to ensnare the other. You can feel the recalcitrant hardness of the other echo, a shell that must be dissolved with apathy and doubt... and you can sense the malign intelligence of the Maw working through the false echo of the older Callistege to prepare the real echo for its destruction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Some of the voices belong to individual Maws, evoking impressions of *hunger* and *need*. Others resonate from deeper places within the Bloom.

From all around you, the Bloom's voices shriek in hatred and fury. The tongues twist and writhe... the ground shakes...

You pull up abruptly. You don't want this woman to see your secrets anymore.

You turn to look at her at last. Her eyes burn through the blank stare of her porcelain mask. She says, "I've aided you in your researches, uncovered secrets of the Tides you never knew, would never have figured on your own. I'm twice the thinker you a-"

Your hand lashes out, slapping the mask from her face. You hear it crack on the ground.

Your sire's memory fades...
