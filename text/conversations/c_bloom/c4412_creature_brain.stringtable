      <DefaultText>The head of this creature was truly massive, though the flesh has been eaten away, probably by the same corpuscular maws that attacked you. Parts of the skull are missing, revealing a huge, glistening brain.

An organic sheath still encases the brain, and it looks as if the brain's cranial juices have protected it from serious decomposition. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your suspicions are correct. The brain's sheath hasn't decayed, though a strange and pungent smell emanates from it. This must be why the nascent maws have left it alone - some sort of pheromone seems to push them away. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The creature is thoroughly dead - there's no doubt about that - but the preservation of the brain means that some of its memories could still be intact. A powerful infusion of Tidal energy might bring the brain back to life, at least for a while.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You concentrate on the flux and pull of the Tides within you, and you send them surging out into the creature's dead mind. Its neck jerks a bit as a simulacrum of life floods into its brainstem. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The slate-and-fuchsia sky above you threatens another spate of the oily slurry it has regurgitated for the past thousand years. Hunger tears your belly, the first signs of impending starvation. You have ruled these vast lands for the centuries of your life, torn your supremacy from the throats of all those who would challenge you. 

And yet... something has changed. The very air has torn asunder, creating a floating rift that leads to another place... a place that smells of raw flesh.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The entire world *shakes*. More little creatures spill from the walls, but these have lashing tendrils and shining maws. They fall upon you, chewing and annihilating, and you bellow in pain. The world shakes again, and the whole chamber collapses upon you, trapping you, holding you fast as the little monsters devour you, bite by bite. 

Your death is long and agonizing. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You slice a small portion of the sheath away from the exposed brain and dig out a handful of raw brain. The sheath closes quickly, healing the gap, though the gouge in the brain itself remains. You raise the handful to your mouth and chew quickly, concentrating on the teachings of the Dendra O'Hur.

The taste is slightly nutty, with an aftertaste of raw sewage.

Images begin to flicker, and your consciousness starts to fade...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The brain's sheath hasn't decayed, though a strange and pungent smell emanates from it. Perhaps that's why the corpuscular maws left the brain alone. Its tissues don't seem to be badly damaged.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lingering aftertaste of the Bloom's juices still befouls your mouth, and the taste grows stronger as you consider the fallen monster.

You can feel impotent rage, hatred, and claustrophobia... and you realize that you're not feeling the creature's mind, but something trapped within. There's a nascent Maw trapped within the creature's stomach, struggling to be free, and with a sudden insight, you know why the corpuscular maws were swarming the corpse. They were trying to free the other Maw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Riastrad smiles as she says, "I can do better than that. I can link your mind to it."

He reaches out to you, placing his hand on your shoulder, and his other hand rests on the great brain.

Your mind goes away, your consciousness subsumed by the beast's last memories.</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>You dive into the rift, suddenly finding yourself in a very different place... a paradise where *everything* is made of meat. Ravenous, you heave yourself toward the nearest wall of flesh, scattering a horde of tiny, two-legged creatures that aren't worth a moment's attention. You tear chunks from the wall, chewing and swallowing. The meat is tough and foul-tasting, but it's *food*, and you're starving. </DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>You feel impotent rage, hatred, claustrophobia... but it's not from the creature's mind. There's something trapped *within* that is struggling to be free.

From the way the corpuscular maws were swarming the corpse, whatever's trapped inside is something the Bloom wants set free - perhaps a part of the Bloom itself.</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>You can see arcs of movement, small ripples in its surface. The monster is still thoroughly dead, but its brain reacts to the power you've spilled into it.

Several clusters of nerves at the base of the brain begin twitching spasmodically. They may still be connected to other parts of the creature's body.</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>You eat and eat, carving your way through the wall, and fall through into another chamber. You see a protuberance of flesh nearby, surrounded by wriggling tendrils. It looks delicious, so you tear it from the wall and swallow it whole.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your knowledge of healing helps you trace and understand the function of these nerves. It seems that a good many of them are still functional and are associated with bodily functions. One cluster attaches to the shoulder, and another attaches to the back. A third cluster runs down to the intestines. 

Something in the brain is sending and receiving impulses along the tattered nerves. You might be able to manipulate the entire corpse from here.</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>Three separate bundles stand out, and they look as if they're connected to specific parts of the creature's body. It's hard to determine which is which, though, so you'll have to spend some time figuring out which cluster leads where.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You poke and prod at each cluster, watching how the creature's muscles react and tracing the path of the tangled nerves. Your diligence pays off. You can see that one cluster attaches to the shoulder, and another attaches to the back. A third cluster runs down to the intestines.

      <DefaultText>You poke at the nerve clusters, and you can see tremors running along the creature's decaying muscles. Unfortunately, it's delicate work, and the nerves are tangled and intertwined. After focusing on the task for a while, you still aren't sure which nerves are connected to which parts of the creature's body.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The whole back of the corpse contracts and heaves. Chunks of rotting flesh tumble to the ground, and you hear a wet *snap* as nerve fibers separate somewhere in the spine.

      <DefaultText>A great peristalsis flows through the creature's viscera. The more you probe the nerves, the greater the force of the expulsion. A trickle of waste - including some fragments of Bloom-flesh - emerges from the backside of the creature with an especially forceful contraction. 

Something rumbles and thrashes in the creature's guts. Whatever it is, it sounds like it's alive... and trapped.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You press hard on the nerve cluster, again and again. The stomach clenches and contracts with terrible force. An unbelievably horrendous mixture spews from the corpse's nether regions, with a miasmic stench that could cause a genocide.</DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>Bloom-tongues rip through decaying intestines, spraying stomach juices in every direction. Then a great mouth appears, bursting through the dead flesh. Its tendrils sink into the viscera, anchoring itself in place. 

The *thing* that was trapped in the stomach is a Maw.</DefaultText>
