      <DefaultText>The down of this murden is patchy and streaked with its abhuman blood. Glassy eyes filled with hatred stare at you, and its beak dribbles foam. It cradles a ragged bundle fiercely to its chest.

As you approach, the murden blasts a field of static into your mind. You involuntarily step back, unable to get any closer to the creature.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The injured murden snaps and hisses at you, cradling a ragged bundle close to its chest. 

Every time you draw near, it blasts you with mental static. It's impossible to get close to the creature without suffering intense pain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You unwrap the ragged cloth bundle that the murden was trying to hide from you. Inside, you find an egg-shaped object of pearly white synth. When your hand brushes against it, you hear cheerful music.  You also find something that looks like an adorably fuzzy head mounted atop a metal cylinder. The head is alive and appears to be dozing.

You take both items.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You place your hand on the Annulet, and the murden immediately clutches its head and screeches piteously. Its mental static echoes back and forth between the murden and the Annulet, overlapping and intensifying. The pain gets worse for you, too - just as you're about to remove your hand from the Annulet, the murden groans and collapses to the ground, unconscious.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Riastrad places his hand on your arm, and you can feel Satsada's mind enveloping yours, shielding you from the worst of the murden's projected mind. You can still hear it beating and squalling against her defenses, but the mental sound is quiet, almost soothing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Riastrad touches your shoulder, and you can feel Satsada's mind joining yours to push forward. But the murden's *hate* is too *strong*, its consuming rage forcing its way past her shields, battering you until you withdraw.

      <DefaultText>Riastrad reaches out to put his hand on your shoulder, and you can *feel* Satsada reaching out with her mind, but you shrug them both off. Your mental fortress is unassailable, unbreachable, and you step forward into the murden's onslaught.

Its mental static slides from your shields, its hatred not enough to penetrate your defenses. You look down on its pitiable form.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Riastrad reaches out for you as you step forward, but you are beyond his grasp. Unable to join minds, Satsada extends her mind in a fruitless attempt to protect you.

But it is to no avail. The murden blasts a field of rage, of hate, of all-consuming antipathy, and the sensation drives you to your knees. You're barely able to roll to the edge of the static field before you pass out briefly.

      <DefaultText>The murden's mental shrieking batters your mind, but somehow you're able to overcome the pain to step closer to the murden. You can reach out and touch it from here.</DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>You steel yourself and step forward. Instantly, the murden's static rises to a shriek inside your mind, battering and confusing you. A veil of darkness begins to drop over your eyes, and you stagger back, shaking your head in pain.

The murden screeches in triumph.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You concentrate briefly and center yourself, closing yourself off from outside distractions. Your mind is clean. Your mental fortress is unassailable, unbreachable, and you step forward into the murden's onslaught.

      <DefaultText>You concentrate deeply, though you're all too conscious of the snapping mental rape the murden is throwing at you. You try to center yourself, and you step forward into the radius of its power.

The murden blasts a field of rage, of hate, of all-consuming antipathy, and the sensation drives you to your knees. You're barely able to roll to the edge of the static field before you pass out briefly.

      <DefaultText>You hold the creature by the greasy down of its neck and deliver a quick punch to the base of its skull. Its static field immediately dissipates, and the murden goes limp in your hands. It releases its grip on the ragged bundle it was trying to hide.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Unlike other murdens you've encountered, the mental blast of this one is not just annoying... it's actively painful. 

The murden is clearly in a feral, desperate state. Its glassy eyes suggest delirium or madness. Perhaps this has somehow intensified its psychic abilities. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grip the murden by the throat and *squeeze*. It feebly tries to push you away, but the creature is even weaker than you thought - thin and bloody and starving. With a resounding snap, you dislocate the murden's head from its spine, and it goes limp. The sudden mental silence is almost disorienting.</DefaultText>
