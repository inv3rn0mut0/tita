The Memovira stands before you, her gaze strong and unflinching, though her face is lined and stress marks her mouth. "You have retrieved the second Merecaster, I assume. I will need to examine it to ensure that this is the same one entrusted to my care."</DefaultText>

The Memovira's face is red with anger, and you can see the veins throbbing in her forehead. Her voice has lost its cultured edge. "You're five seconds away from feeding the laaks, usurper. Explain your actions or die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your instincts were correct - she *is* afraid of you. She hesitates a moment, and something in the cast of your face convinces her. "Very well." She passes you the shunt and gives you a key to the the Merecaster's vault. "I tell you now, though: I have no idea how to reverse the shunt's effects. Search my mind if you wish, Satsada - I find it a delicious irony, but my malice does not extend that far."</DefaultText>
