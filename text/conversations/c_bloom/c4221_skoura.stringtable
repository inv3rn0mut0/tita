      <DefaultText>Made from an opaque, battered metal, it seems to thrum with energy. Small lights flicker in the air above it. Skoura's lips slobber into a toothy smile. "My pride and my punishment, all in one," she says.

Then she hides it behind her back. "And if you want it, you'll help me regain my sight. If not... you'll never know its wonders."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She twirls quickly, holding the jar out of your reach. "You want my toy, the prize for which I paid so dear? I'll give it to you, if that's your wish, but you'll like its results as little as I." She leers at you, her hand on the control panel, aiming the mouth of the jar at you like a weapon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sweet sight returns? I welcome it, friend, I - AAAGH!" The eye begins to burn into her flesh, extruding small legs that heat and twist as they burrow deeper into the meat and bone of her head.

She claps her hands over the eye, instinctively scrabbling at the invasive device, and you recognize the titanic act of will it takes for her to let the eye do its work. Her trust in you must be great - or her need for vision desperate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At last she collects herself, wiping away the stream of tears that poured from the single eye. She looks in amazement at the moisture on her hands and mutters, "It has rebuilt the entire structure. Amazing. More investigation required."

Then she glances up at you and thrusts the jar into your hands. "Here. More trouble than it was worth." 

She turns away, gasping in delight at every newly revealed sight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This is the Iron Wind, and though you survive its protean touch - for a few minutes, anyway - what's left of you is a twisted, unrecognizable lump of flesh. Your final few moments are agony.

      <DefaultText>This creature stirs and mutters at your approach. Though the form is recognizably humanoid, its - *her* - head is horribly disfigured. Something has wiped her face clean of features, leaving an expanse of mottled and bulbous flesh, save only a horrifically enlarged mouth and two small holes where her ears should be.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She hears you approach and clutches a small jar close to her chest. "What would you have with Skoura? Though my looks have been stolen, scribbled away by a million thoughtless particles, I can hear you breathing. I can taste what others can only smell - your fear, your exertion." She smacks her oversized lips. "Tell me... if you had lost your sight, what price would you pay for its return?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was a nano once, a researcher on the cutting edge of the science of, ah, 'nano spirits.' In particular, I sought to harness the power of the Iron Wind. But the shields, ah, my shields, they gave way around me, and the Iron Wind swirled in and found me." She smiles sadly, her immense mouth drooling. She pats the jar. "I captured some of the Iron Wind here, but it still... *remade* me. I was cast out, an abomination, and now I skulk and beg for my living. At least the murdens fear me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She giggles, the sound slightly obscene. "Perhaps the exposure to my beauty has addled your mind? Quickly then, quickly - I dwelt on the cutting edge of knowledge, and so I sought to harness the Iron Wind. I found it, oh yes. And it found me. Now I hide here, blind and mourning, with only my prize to keep my company."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We are in agreement, then." She nods at the jar in her hands. "This contains a piece of the Iron Wind, the nano-storm that blows across the world and reshapes all in its path. It is my most prized possession, the culmination of my labors... and it was not worth that which was taken in its taking. I would trade it in a moment if I could only see again." She smacks her horrid mouth at you. "I can *taste* the strangeness of you. You are different from the others here. I beg your aid."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ha! I might have expected such an answer from someone with a strange taste like yours. I would welcome such a gift, but I can tell that you haven't experienced the privation of blindness." She nods toward her jar. "This is a piece of the Iron Wind. It is my most prized possession, and I would give it away in a moment if it meant that I could see once again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After what seems like an eternity of her screams and moans, Skoura pulls her hands from her disfigured face. She tilts her head up at you, and her mouth stretches into an involuntary smile of pure joy. You wave your hand in front of her face, and the eye tracks it naturally, cleanly.

She throws her arms around you, sobbing with relief and happiness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The deformed woman anticipates your movement, and her fingers dance along the control panel of the jar at electric speed. The lid fades in a haze of energy, and a wave of grayish-red particles spill out in a vortex of unimaginable power.

They wash over you and through you, rewriting your genetics at the most atomic level, twisting you into new, horrific shapes. Your bones stretch and split, your flesh sags and balloons, your organs distend through your skin... and you feel every change.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She smacks her lips at Callistege and recoils slightly. "The echoes of space and time wrap around your flavor. You must be... Callistege." The last word is a sneer. "Be assured - I have heard of you. You hadn't heard of me because your interests were unsavory. Mine were beneficial, intended to solve the plague of the Iron Wind. Had I sought personal gain in my research, no doubt our paths would have crossed. "</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Apparently he doesn't hear anything past the word 'yes', because he moves with amazing speed to take the jar from Skoura's hands. "Beg pardon, milady, but we can't have face-stealing jars sitting around and mocking their victims. We'll set this jar right."

He gives the jar a solid shake.

"Is this sealed tightly? It seems a little loose. It sounds like sand is moving around inside. Is that the sound faces make when they're removed? It's a kind of... *whooshing* noise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Somehow, with idiot luck, he opens the lid. It fades in a haze of energy, and a wave of grayish-red particles spill out in a vortex of unimaginable power.

      <DefaultText>Made from an opaque, battered metal, it looks like a repurposed cylinder intended to hold some sort of high-energy matter. Control panels emit small readouts into the air above its surface. The jar thrums with energy, almost alive, and Skoura's lips slobber into a toothy smile. "My pride and my punishment, all in one," she says.

Then she hides it behind her back. "And if you want it, you'll help me regain my sight. If not... you'll never know its wonders."
