      <DefaultText>A crystalline structure more than three meters tall, at first glance the Quishamis appears motionless. Then, as you watch, it slowly *unfolds* from within, like a flower opening in full bloom. It moves forward with the clatter and squeal of grinding crystal, its center folding outward endlessly in an impossible, hypnotic stream.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stare at the pattern, but after some time you're still no closer to understanding what the Quishamis is trying to do. You have noticed, however, that each line is actually a series of cuts, and not a single mark scored into the ground. It looks as though the Quishamis has been at this for quite some time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stare at the pattern for what seems like hours. Every time you blink, you see the lines and whorls of the Quishamis' work engraved on the inside of your eyelids. Finally, in a single moment of startling clarity, it clicks.

The Quishamis is drawing a portal to summon itself home. You don't know how you know, any more than you know that if you were to move *this* rock and complete *that* line, the drawing - the schematic! - would be complete.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Quishamis grows smaller as it falls, eventually becoming little more than a shining, tumbling speck of dust. You see it strike the ground far below, but no sound accompanies the impact. From here, it's difficult to tell if the Quishamis is moving, or whether the force of it hitting the ground caused a series of small, scintillating tremors.

      <DefaultText>You carry the Quishamis into the enclosed area. When you carefully let go of it and step away, it remains in place, unmoving. You wait a while, even moving out of sight to see if the Quishamis registers your absence.

Nothing happens. The Quishamis stays frozen, as still as the crystal spars that surround it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But you also see how each line is a series of cuts, each a little deeper than the last.

The thought slams into your mind in the same moment that the Quishamis vanishes, the cracks in the ground shivering and tearing through each other in an impossible, gut-wrenching pattern. After a few unbearable moments, the movement stops, and the drawing - and the Quishamis - are gone.

      <DefaultText>It doesn't respond when you place a hand on it, though the pressure in your mind increases somewhat. Tentatively pushing and pulling the Quishamis reveals that it's lighter than it looks. You could probably carry it quite easily.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You quest for the edge of the tumult, thoughts and memories streaming away in your wake like bubbles escaping from the mouth of a corpse.

The surface lies just ahead of you, flickering with actinic light. Then, it's below you, and you were moving away from it all this time. There, to the right, it appears again, a halogen glow like the noonday sun, stripped of its ferocity by the turbulent waters.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The feeling of struggle abates. You float in calmed and calming waters, the thoughts no longer spiralling around you but through you. Each new strand brings a jolt of vertigo, like falling asleep in slow, delicate stages, oblivion layering itself over your consciousness layer by petal-thin layer.

Some time later you become aware of a clarion tolling that sends shivers across your skin and down your spine. Yet no matter which direction you face, the sound is always just beyond your grasp.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Home!

The feeling is fierce and joyful, and the Quishamis is instantly ready to depart.

However, you know from your own experience of the Bloom that the Quishamis' journey home won't be an easy one, if it makes it at all. There are many it could hurt - and many who would hurt it - along the path you've offered.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Quishamis races past you, down the crystal stairs. You hear Sarissa's cry of fear as the Quishamis passes through the camp, then the dull buzzing of the portal's activation. The Quishamis is gone, departed for the Bloom.

The Quishamis doesn't sound inspired by your insistence, but it moves into the alcove. It settles there, like a dog watching for a sign of its absent master, and waits. Nothing you say or do appears to reach it, but it also doesn't look as though it's going to go back out onto the plateau any time soon.

Sarissa should be pleased, at least.

      <DefaultText>In the jumbled, twisted, multi-phasic image that follows, you quickly discern two facts before you're forced to shut both of your eyes to stave off madness: the drawing the Quishamis is creating is a portal to somewhere else that could be completed with a few strokes... or disabled with a few different ones.</DefaultText>

      <ID>163</ID>
      <DefaultText>With a high-pitched keening like the shriek of grinding gears, the Quishamis rushes into the alcove and starts trying to salvage the remnants of its design. The new lines are deep and true, however, and the pitch of the Quishamis' distress rises with each new mark it discovers until the ringing in your ears forces you to retreat.

Ideally, at the point the player would be able to choose between all of the places they've visited so far in the game, to show the Quishamis that they understand the concept of 'home.' This choice would then also factor into the tide increase at the end. However, for this test, I thought a short explanation would suffice.)</DefaultText>

The air around the Quishamis fills with tiny slivers of crystal, like stationary snowflakes. A couple of them lash out toward you, rattling off your armor with impossible force.

The Quishamis moves away from you. It refuses any further attempts to communicate, drowning you out with a whitewash of psychic static that causes you to recoil in pain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stand in the Quishamis' path, studying it. Close up, you can see that its movement is, in fact, a sort of perpetual reconstruction: the Quishamis is not so much moving as growing and dissolving itself through linear space.

You're so entranced by the sight that you barely notice the crystal shards slicing into your flesh, at least until the Quishamis comes to a stop in front of you, silent and suddenly terrifying.

You snap back into full awareness of your body, only to vomit violently and unrelentingly for what seems like hours. Eventually, your stomach still painful with heaving spasms, you stand, doing your best to avoid looking at the marks beneath your feet.</DefaultText>
