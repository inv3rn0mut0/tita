      <DefaultText>Inside the small camp, you see a group of explorers arguing fiercely. At your approach, a tall woman in form-fitting black armor breaks away from the discussion and strides toward you. She carries a long spear in a loose-handed grip that somehow implies violence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You there!" She stops in front of you, looking you up and down while her companions continue to argue. After a moment, she offers a dazzling smile. "Looking to make some easy shins?"

      <DefaultText>A smear of blood beneath her chin and scuff marks on her armor indicate that she's recently been fighting. Small slivers of crystal still protrude from the back of her left hand, and she flexes it unconsciously as she speaks.</DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>She smiles at your approach.

"Hello again, friend."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Welcome back." Her left hand tightens around her spear ever so slightly. Somewhat disconcertingly, her companions are still arguing. "Did you move the Quishamis?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's this *thing* we've been trying to get past that just refuses to budge." She glances over her right shoulder toward a set of stairs carved into the crystal wall. "Achor says it's a 'Quishamis,' whatever that means."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All I know is it looks like it's been here a good while. That, and it doesn't take kindly to intrusions." She smiles quickly. "That explains why Achor likes it, at any rate. They're as stubborn as each other."

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>She turns her left wrist and squints at the crystals embedded in her skin.

"I thought I got them all." She quickly yanks the slivers free, dropping them as blood wells from the puncture wounds. With a flick of her right wrist a strip of cloth appears between her fingers, unspooling from within her armor. She bandages her left hand and studies her work briefly before returning her attention to you.

"Thanks. I would've known they were there tomorrow for sure." She grimaces. "Listen - "

    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>She laughs at that.

      <DefaultText>She tilts her head to one side. "It's a crystalline entity, twice as tall as you or me. The way it moves is... Well." She laughs uncomfortably. "It's like it's constantly breaking apart at the seams and stitching itself back together."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>83</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods.

"It's crystalline, it might be intelligent, and it doesn't like company."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>84</ID>
      <DefaultText>She opens her mouth to reply, then smiles instead. "Thanks, but that won't be necessary. We just need it out of the way while we go past, and ideally until we come back. Then it can have the whole place to itself again, no questions asked."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, I'm sure," she says, exasperated. "My clients might want to study it later, if they can get over the cuts and bruises it's given them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Communicating is what I do," she says without a trace of modesty, "but it doesn't seem to understand any of the languages we know, and it's not responding to any of the numenera we brought with us. I even tried sketching pictograms on the ground, to ask it to let us pass. It just swept over my drawings and erased them as if they'd never existed." She purses her lips. "Quite the critique."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've tried spoken language, numenera, and pictograms. It didn't like my drawings, but that was the only time it really acknowledged our presence."</DefaultText>

      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You can get the Quishamis out of the way for a while." She studies you momentarily, coming to some sort of decision. "Me and my team, we're here to scout the area and see if it's worth establishing a permanent camp. There could be powerful numenera here, and it's a hard place to get to. But you already knew that."</DefaultText>

      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Move the Quishamis somehow - distract it, trap it, play a game of cards with it." She smiles to take the edge off her tone. "I'm sure you'll come up with something."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's not only possible, it's likely. But our research," she grimaces at the word, but continues, "has shown it to be organic, not synthetic."

"Well," she amends, "as organic as something made of stabbing shards of crystal can be."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>101</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not much." She frowns. "I'd say it was resisting our attempts to classify it, but that would imply it was capable of understanding abstract thought."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>102</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Have you documented your discoveries?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She waits impassively for your next question.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>107</ID>
      <DefaultText>She suppresses a smile.

"Go right ahead. But you'll be racing my clients for publication."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>108</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You could say that, yeah." She bares her teeth in a humorless smile.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And?" she asks, flatly. "All the more reason for us to study what it's guarding."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course we have." She closes her eyes, and for a moment she looks ten years older. Then she meets your gaze again and the years fall away.  "But we came here with a job to do. We'd look foolish going back with it half done." She smiles ruefully. "That's not really what I'm about. I've got a reputation to uphold."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>111</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Actually, yes. That would be the respectful course of action."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>112</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, I just think you might not be able to conduct your research if it's still alive."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>113</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't really care what you do. All *I* can do is provide you with the facts I see before me."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>114</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Too bad."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>115</ID>
      <DefaultText>She glares at you for a moment, then looks away.

"I can't. Even if I could somehow convince my clients to leave, they wouldn't pay me. Job incomplete. You know."

She meets your gaze again. "Some of us don't get to choose our ideals."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>116</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm sorry."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She doesn't even bother to hide her contempt.

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>120</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks at you as if seeing you for the first time, then shakes herself lightly.

"Don't be. It's not your fault."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>121</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Or we know our limits."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>122</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Leave that for us to worry about. You get it away from the main path and whatever happens afterward is no longer your concern."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>123</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It is my concern. I could be putting you all in danger."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>126</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And do people ask you to save them often, or..?" She leans in conspiratorially.

"Do the job you're paid for, then book it. *Before* your mark gets you in more trouble than the money's worth." She leans back once more, resting her weight on the haft of her spear. "You can have that one for free."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>127</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her jaw tightens.

"Don't presume to understand me." She raises a hand to stave off anything else you might have to add.

"Don't. Just ask your questions and leave."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>128</ID>
      <DefaultText>She grins savagely.

"We've been here a couple of years," she says lightly, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. "You get used to being cut off from civilization. I just hope the world hasn't forgotten me."
