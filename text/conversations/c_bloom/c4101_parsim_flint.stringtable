      <DefaultText>"Parsim Flint is my name, and the disbursement of so-called 'slaves' to so-called 'owners' - for the betterment of both parties - is my trade. What sort of slave are you looking for?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Certainly. These slaves," Flint nods at the bedraggled men and women in the pit, "are convicts of the foulest sort. They are the very dregs of Sagus Cliffs and her surrounding communities."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fat little man turns toward you, a wide smile already on his face. Indeed, his smile is unnaturally wide, reaching almost to his ears. You notice that his mouth contains *two* rows of white, well-manicured teeth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You catch me in the midst of an auction, sir, but no need to beg pardon, my clients will wait." He leans forward, conspiratorially. "I find that a short delay in the proceedings gets them talking amongst themselves and sparks their competitive natures. Good for prices." The smile gets even wider, if that's possible.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Flint blinks in surprise, but his smile doesn't falter. "To feed Maws, of course. Unless you're planning to let them feed on *you*, but I wouldn't advise that." The little man shudders dramatically to emphasize his point.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Naturally, it helps to know what a Maw wants before you go buying a slave. Not much point in buying a slave who isn't appetizing to the Maw in question."

Then he adds in a whisper, "You'd be surprised how many people make *that* mistake." Flint gives you a knowing wink, as if to emphasize the silliness of *those* people.</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well!" Flint puffs himself up, which makes him look a good deal fatter, but not a bit taller. "I have all the major crimes represented here. Murder of course, that's a given. But also graft, assault, treason, burglary, and conspiracy to commit all of those crimes. The foulest sort of predators, that's my guarantee to you!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They come with all manner of emotional disorders, if that's what you're seeking. I'll find you a slave who caters to the needs of your Maw, *whatever* it wants."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nonsense! You're in exactly the *right* place, if you want to get anywhere in the Bloom. How do you expect to open a Maw if you don't have any *food*," he jabs an elbow in the direction of the slaves, "to provide?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Now see here." Flint's smile vanishes. "We are not living in the dark days of Chila the Great. I do not sell these slaves into lives of hard labor."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"In order to pay their debt to society, many choose Bloom-slavery instead of prison or execution. These individuals are given to me, and I sell them to the enterprising merchants who ply the Bloom."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Usually my clients come to me with specific requirements. Every Maw has its own unique tastes, you see, and it won't open unless it gets precisely what it wants. So I offer an appropriate slave, and they *feed* that slave to the Maw. And everyone is happy." Flint grins, both rows of teeth shining whitely from inside his enormous mouth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The slaves *volunteer* to be eaten?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>Flint blinks, apparently taken aback. "They're desperate people! And being fed to the Bloom is *not* a death sentence. Well, not always."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sometimes the Bloom only devours certain aspects of a person, and they're entirely changed for the better. Or it takes a small, trivial part of them - an eye, or half a stomach, or their ability to feel love - and spits them out into another world, where they can start their lives anew." Flint beams at the thought of it all.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Once a Maw feeds on a slave, that slave is free. That's the law, mind you. Unless the *murdens* get hold of you." Flint crinkles his nose in disgust. "They don't give a bird's turd about such things."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"Indeed? Ask them!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of varying sorts, yes. The more vicious, the better, at least as far as my clients are concerned." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>Flint leans toward you again, his voice falling to a theatrical whisper. "The Bloom has a taste for the criminal element. Dangerous, predatory sorts of people draw its attention... sometimes for better, sometimes for worse."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah, but that *is* the question. Sometimes you can puzzle it out on your own by *watching* the Maw... observing the behavior of its tongues." He wrinkles his nose. "A disgusting business altogether."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Better to ask someone who's been here for a long time. They're barking mad, most of them, but they have an uncanny sense of the Bloom's desires. Some of them claim to *hear* the voice of the Bloom in their minds."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hearing the voice of the Bloom, ha!" Flint whistles and waggles his finger at his head. "That's when you *know* you're in trouble!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>Flint's eyes light up. If his smile got any wider, it would tear itself off his face and go scampering away.

"So you're a registered merchant, are you? Got all the proper documents, signed and stamped in all the right places?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Uhh... no."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sorry, I must have left them in my mansion."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We don't need official documents to make a deal."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>The upturned ends of Flint's mouth sag like deflated balloons. "Oh. Well that's terrible news. I'm afraid I can only do business with merchants who are registered at the Sagus Guild of Trade."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>Suddenly Flint glances around in such an exaggerated caricature of stealth that you aren't sure whether he is serious. "On the other hand," he whispers, "perhaps we *can* make a deal... beneath the purview of the relevant authorities, as it were."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>Flint shakes his head sadly, in exactly the manner of a melodramatic actor. "Then I'm afraid we cannot do business. I am under strict regulations, enforced at the point of a blade, you understand."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>One of Flint's eyebrows rises absurdly high. "Ridiculous!" he exclaims. "Of course I need official documentation - do you take me for a scofflaw, sir?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>Suddenly Flint lowers his voice and leans toward you. "Sorry, have to keep up appearances. In truth, I would be *happy* to make a deal, so long as the relevant authorities are none the wiser."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Forget it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>The little man sighs in an exaggerated fashion. "So be it, then."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"One of my slaves is not attracting any buyers. He's a young fellow, fresh from the streets of Sagus, but I fear he's only a thief, not a murderer or a sadist at all. You can imagine how that's gone over with my clients."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Since I cannot sell him in a legitimate manner, I am forced to go under the proverbial table. You may have him for a mere... oh... [Global: c4101_CotyPriceOriginal] shins. No returns, refunds, or restitution." Flint flashes a disturbingly wide and toothy grin.

      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Certainly. He's just over there."

Flint gestures toward one of the bedraggled slaves in the pit - a young man, well-built, with a surprisingly sober expression, given his condition. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hrmm..." Flint produces a sheaf of papers from a voluminous pocket and shuffles through them, finally settling upon one. His eyes scan the page. "Let's see here. Third time arrested for thievery... minimal resistance to arresting levy..." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Curious. Non-violent offenders aren't usually considered for Bloom-slavery, but he volunteered anyway. Some of them do, you know, if they're *running* from something. Or if they're barking mad."

The little man shrugs, stuffing the papers back into his pocket.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not for sale. Not under any circumstances, I'm afraid." The little man shakes his head sorrowfully, and with such a regretful expression that you could *almost* believe he cares. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I am willing to bend the rules in the case of this one slave only. The Memovira will feed *me* to a Maw if I start selling all the slaves to unregistered clients. And I mean that quite literally." </DefaultText>

      <ID>79</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All right, I'll take him."

      <DefaultText>"A pity." Flint wipes his stubby hands together, as if washing them of the whole affair. "But I shall be happy to resume our discussion if you manage to claw your way out of penury." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>Flint turns from his clients and greets you with a hopeful smile. His double rows of teeth glint unsettlingly in the murky light."You've come to make a purchase, have you?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>Flint turns from his clients, his smile apologetic, but unnaturally wide as ever. "I'm afraid I have no more illicit, under-the-table deals for you."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Out there." Flint waves a stubby hand toward the large opening on the far side of the chamber. "In the corners and crannies of the Bloom. Look for dark, shadowy places, surrounded by clusters of Bloom-tongues."</DefaultText>

      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Erm, yes, they are. Closing, disappearing, changing destinations, and behaving badly all around."

Flint glances over at the guards, his smile faltering.  "That sort of thing is better to say in a *low* voice, preferably far away from the Memovira's lugs. Or they might get the idea that you're blaming *her* for the problem."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Flint waves a stubby hand. "As I said, you ask around. Some of these destitute folk have been here for a long time, and they know what the local Maw wants. Others claim to hear the voice of the Bloom." The little man chuckles. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something like surprise - or maybe even pride - ripples across the little man's face. Flint straightens, and his features seem softer and brighter. For the first time, his smile seems genuine.

"All right," he says quietly. "[Global: c4101_CotyPriceSuperCheap] shins it is. But that offer is conditional upon your *immediate* acceptance. Walk away from this deal, sir, and it is gone for good."
