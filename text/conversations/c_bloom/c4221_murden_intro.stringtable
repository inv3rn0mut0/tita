      <DefaultText>The static in your head grows louder, more insistent and frightened. The creatures turn and flee through a doorway into an adjoining room. The way is clear... for now.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mental static grows louder and more insistent, a pitch of rising excitement, as the murdens count their newfound wealth, snapping and biting at each other as they fight over who will get more. Finally one draws blood, the other yields, and they both retreat to their nests.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You touch the annulet, and immediately the murdens clutch their heads and double over. They croak piteously, stricken by some terrible agony. 

As soon as you release the annulet, they shake their heads, and it's clear that their pain is gone. Though they have not yet cleared the path, they seem wary of you now.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The larger murden hisses angrily and holds out its hand. You place [Global:c4221_MurdenSentryBribeAmount] shins into its greasy palm, and it backs away to its nest, its companion trailing behind it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In response, they puff themselves up, showing their size and strength. At the same moment, their psychic static increases, and you can sense derision and mockery.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>The murdens' hissing and clacking increases, and now they're shaking their weapons directly at you. This could lead to bloodshed if you're not careful.

Worse, their psychic bleedthrough assaults your senses, leaving the world looking fuzzy and unclear.

      <DefaultText>The creatures pause in their ever-moving dance and gape at you... and then one throws down its weapon and flees, with the other hard on its heels.

      <DefaultText>The murdens stop their posturing for a moment as they process your words, and they hiss and bob their heads in mockery. Worse, the blanket of psychic malaise that hangs around them seems to thicken.

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>They paw through your pack, scattering your goods, but don't find enough shins to satisfy their needs. The static around them intensifies with their anger. They're not going anywhere.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two hunched, avian humanoids stare at you, their bright and hate-filled eyes shining above dirty yellow beaks. You recognize them at once... *murdens.* They emit a kind of psychic fuzz, a mental blanket that makes it difficult for you to concentrate. 

One puffs up its greasy black feathers to make itself look larger, while the other scrapes close to the ground. Their arms wave and gesture, and the intent is clear: *Go no further.*</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your ability to read minds only exacerbates the static, amplifying it to painful levels. It takes a supreme effort of will to shut out the noise.

Apparently, reading the minds of murdens is a bad idea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You drop your remaining shins into the murdens' hands. They clack their beaks again, expecting more. When you offer nothing further, they shriek with rage and hurl the coins back in your face.</DefaultText>
