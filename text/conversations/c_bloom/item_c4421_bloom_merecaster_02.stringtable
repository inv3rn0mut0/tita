      <DefaultText>You are in that familiar place between waking and sleeping, the well of night with your waking world at the top. 

Again, the sense of questing comes, the feeling that someone is calling your name.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Sorrow. The Sorrow is seeking you. A single thread of its focus has latched on to you, drawing the fabric of its consciousness your way.

      <DefaultText>Though you could not place the feeling before, this is a voice you recognize now: it is the Sorrow, and it is seeking you.

      <DefaultText>You feel the Sorrow drawing itself toward you, materializing through vast spaces and echoing hallways of time, and you are staggered at the power it marshals.

      <DefaultText>As if in answer to your rising alarm, a swarming chorus of buzzing voices boils into your mind, the hive mind of a tremendously strong entity. This maddening choir drowns out the Sorrow's presence, and you feel its tenuous grasp on you loosen altogether. Its presence lingers a moment, and then withdraws.

      <DefaultText>You feel the voice meshing with your mind, and then you feel a buzzing, vibrating, cacophonous cage of psychic fury constructing a defensive framework around you. The Sorrow's will is unequal to the task of destroying the lattice, and you feel the Sorrow's presence withdrawing again.

      <DefaultText>Your fear at the Sorrow's intrusion gives way to rage... a rage matched by the buzzing, swarming voices that suddenly spill into your mind. You are nearly driven to your knees by its palpable, psychic fury.

The Sorrow's presence lingers a moment, and then withdraws.

      <DefaultText>The cold fury of buzzing, swarming voices builds suddenly around you, like a spiraling cloud of insects filling your head. You can feel them crawling across your mind, as if they were climbing through your skull and...

... the Sorrow's presence has withdrawn, and with it, so too do the furious voices.

      <DefaultText>A melange of colors washes behind your eyes as you feel the Sorrow's presence drawing near, and then a rising tide of blackness, a buzzing and chittering as of the world's largest insect hive drives the Sorrow's intrusion away with its rage. 

The Sorrow's presence withdraws, and with it, so too do the furious voices.
