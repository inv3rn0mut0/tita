"Come to think of it, I would too. You're the one whose life kicked all this off, after all... and you're new to it. I'll give you some pointers. Worked out well for the last person who lived in your body!"</DefaultText>

I'd show you around, point out the sights, but... well, can't say I think it's fair that the daughter of the man who ruined my life gets to live, and my daughter's gone. Probably for the best if we part ways."</DefaultText>

I wish you the best with what you're on about, but... well, I don't really want to spend the rest of my days in the company of the White Death. Or anywhere near the Bloom, really. Hope you'll understand. I need answers, and I'm not going to find them here."</DefaultText>
