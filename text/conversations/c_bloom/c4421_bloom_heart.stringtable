      <DefaultText>[The bond is completed. You now have a profound connection to the Bloom, which allows you to command it in a limited fashion, including a handy new ability that lets you summon corpuscular maws in combat!

As you marvel at your newfound link and the sensations it brings with it, a small Bloom-tongue descends from the ceiling and drops the merecaster into your upturned hands. Before you can even begin to search for a way out, the Bloom anticipates your need  and opens a portal leading back to the Courtyard. You could get used to this...]

A few indulgent moments later, the Bloom lazily opens a portal to the Courtyard, as if dismissing you.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Bloom dives deep into your buried memories, tearing them apart, examining them, taking the measure of your mind. You've never been able to plumb the depths of your sire's memory before, and you realize that he has stored so *much* of his life here, carefully ordered like a vast library. 

As the Bloom sifts through the recollections, it devours what it likes. You witness moments in the Changing God's life as they flare into your consciousness for a few moments, only to be chewed up by the Bloom-voices and consumed, lost forever.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see countless laboratories, tangles of wires, and an endless parade of faces - friends, lovers, enemies, nearly all of them riven from you by time's cruel march. You see the faces of bodies in glassy sarcophagi and recognize them as the faces of castoffs. You see gouts of energy rise from the ocean's depths and remember a vociferous argument with a machine intelligence, a fight that led to a frenzied escape as death traps closed all around you. You remember... no. It's already gone.</DefaultText>

Through your shared connection with the Bloom's Heart, you can sense the fear blossoming in her heart, and the knowledge that she has trusted one of her siblings *again*, and has been betrayed *again*. 

She can sense what you're doing, but it's no use. The voices have caught her scent, and they flood out of your mind and into hers, dragging you into her history...</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>She crouches behind a wall, clutching a heel of stale bread, holding her breath as angry guards probe the trash around her. You feel the shock of her first death as a flame lance pierces her heart. You're with her in her escape from Sagus Cliffs, hiding in the shadows and sobbing. You see her enter Kholn, sidling along the walls, trying to steal her next meal. You feel the shock as Neng and his family welcome her with open arms. The Bloom devours the gratitude she feels for their charity.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The voices shriek at the cringing girl, their cries sharp like blades. They dissect her into scattered bits of consciousness, each one screaming in pain and terror and confusion.

You think the words again. *Get out.* This time, your inner voice drowns out theirs. They chitter and buzz in confusion, their onslaught broken. Now you command them - *Get out... now*. 

At once, the voices turn to hisses of frustration and shrieks of rage... and they flee from your mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Moving slowly and cautiously, you follow the faint whispers of the tiny, chittering minds that watch over Ishen. They're not far from the Heart, centered around a foul little cyst, just as you suspected. When they sense your approach, they squeal in alarm, but you overwhelm and silence them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you stretch out your thoughts toward Ishen, you hear squeals of alarm. They're coming from the tiny, chittering minds that the Bloom created to guard its prisoner. You aren't able to silence them, so you quickly withdraw.

Fortunately, you deadened the sensory organs around the Heart before you attempted this, so your attack went unnoticed, but you may not be so lucky again.</DefaultText>

"No, Maralel," you say. "I have no way of... fixing you... but you need not live in shame."

You present her with a mask, its expression enigmatic, decorated with intricate patterns of gold. 

"A pretty thing," she says, unable to hide the bitterness in her voice. "I can just as well wrap my face in bandages, or cover my head with a sack."</DefaultText>

Deprived of the bizarre fluids from elsewhere in the Bloom, the Heart is dying, its collective consciousness unraveling.

The voices flee from your mind in frantic disarray. Before you lose contact with the Bloom entirely, you allow the arteries to open again, but the voices keep their distance. The lesson has been learned.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The unfinished memory of Miel Avest bubbles to the surface, playing out in your mind's eye.

You're facing Maralel, the First Castoff, as she holds the mask you gave her. "Put it on," you hear yourself say, and she places the mask over her face. At once, it melds with her flesh, and her face becomes that of a lovely young woman. 

Her eyes widen, knowing that something has changed, and you hold up a looking glass for her to see. She laughs aloud - a sound you haven't heard from her in years.</DefaultText>

Maralel nods, watching the looking glass carefully as her face morphs into that of an old woman... then a homely beggar-lady... then a varjellen... and a dozen more. 

The last face you see is dark-haired, regal in bearing. It is the face of the Memovira.

    <Entry>
      <ID>228</ID>
      <DefaultText>The implication is clear - the Memovira is merely a disguise, a mask that conceals the First Castoff. She has been alive, hiding behind a false identity, for years.

At last, the memory surfaces. It isn't exactly as the woman remembered. The details are different, like the color of her robe and sky above - clear and blue in your sire's recollection. But now you recognize her for who she is - Maralel, the First Castoff.</DefaultText>

Some of the voices whisper gently, showing you images of yourself holding court in the Memovira's fortress, opening Maws at a touch, summoning masses of tentacled flesh to tear apart your foes. *Memovira*, they whisper, soft and reverent.

All of the Bloom can be yours to command.

      <DefaultText>You drive your hand into a ragged wound that had almost knitted itself back together. Taking hold of a soft, rubbery *something* inside, you pull with all your might. Flesh tears, hot bile erupts from the hole, and a thing that looks like a wriggling, multi-armed intestine lands on the ground, squealing as it dies. Millions of Bloom-voices scream in agony.

      <DefaultText>Reaching tentatively into the Bloom's consciousness, you listen to its whispers and observe the visions and sounds that they trigger in your mind. They seem to sense what you want, and they show you countless memories of the First Castoff in her Memovira-guise. In all of them, she is hurling someone into a Maw, striking down a rival from behind, manipulating others into performing dangerous, near-suicidal tasks for her.

You are, perhaps, no different.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cautiously, Maralel places the mask over her face. Once, she trusted her sire completely. Now, she is not so sure.

The mask sinks into her flesh. Terror flashes through her mind. *What has he done to me?*

The Changing God smiles, holding up a looking glass. Maralel gasps. Her face has become that of a lovely young woman. Relief bubbles out of her, unbidden, as a laugh. Even as it does, she can see that her sire mistakes it for genuine joy. He doesn't even know how he frightens her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You can change your face at will," he says. "Try it."

Maralel nods, watching the looking glass carefully as her face morphs into that of an old woman... then a homely beggar-lady... then a varjellen... and a dozen more.
 
The last face you see is dark-haired, regal in bearing. It is the face of the Memovira.

Accompanied by a distinct sense of *hunger* from the Bloom, the memory fades.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Moments from the Changing God's past flash across your mind's eye, too quick to comprehend. Then a memory surfaces...

You stand with a woman upon a circle of gold, the sky clear and blue above you. *Miel Avest.* The woman is well known to you - the same woman who helped you choose this spot years before, the same woman who built this enclave with you, together. 

Her face has changed, ravaged by time. The flesh is rotting away, exposing the glistening muscles beneath.</DefaultText>

      <ID>437</ID>
      <DefaultText>She turns away from you, as if to hide her ugliness. "Not even your handiwork is proof against time."

"No, Maralel," you say. "I have no way of... fixing you... but you need not live in shame."

You present her with a mask, its expression enigmatic, decorated with intricate patterns of gold. 

"A pretty thing," she says, unable to hide the bitterness in her voice. "I can just as well wrap my face in bandages, or cover my head with a sack."</DefaultText>

      <ID>438</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Put it on." Your voice is insistent. There is something *more* to the mask. She hears it in your voice, and she raises your gift to her face. 

In that moment, Maralel's identity is unmistakable - she is the woman you know as the First Castoff.</DefaultText>

Maralel, the old Memovira, has been cast aside, and soon the Bloom will feast on her. It seeks a new bonding to replace the old. Its voices will become a part of you, and your voice will join the great multitude in the Bloom's mind... each of you a sort of virus in the brain of the other. 

*Memovira*. The voices whisper softly, soothingly. They press even closer, eager and expectant.</DefaultText>

Two figures huddle in the corner of dark, fleshy chamber, having tumbled through a Maw. One is the First, her mask off, her disfigurement revealed. The other is Mazzof, his eyes wide and spooked. 

"The Sorrow can't touch us here," she speaks to him softly, as one would to a frightened beast. "We stay for as long as we must."</DefaultText>

In that moment, Maralel's identity is unmistakable - she is the woman you know as the First Castoff.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rhin wails, holding her head in her hands as another vision appears.

She sits in front of a warm hearth, a kindly woman with a face like hers sews a piece of leather, showing her how to work the heavy needle. A stern but smiling man watches them, then laughs at something you can't hear.

But Rhin can hear it. Tears fall from her face at his words. Then she shrieks as the Bloom burns that memory too.

She breathes heavily, her eyes slightly glazed. "Their names... what were their names?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She wavers, and the agony of indecision is writ plain on her face. At last she shrieks, a primal, animal sound, the cords standing out on her neck.

"I believe in you," she hisses. "I *trust* you. This is my chance - my one shot - and I'm giving it up. For *you*. You'd better be worth it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Heart jerks from side to side, and Bloom-voices scream in hatred and rage. The whispers shift toward Matkina, a susurrus rising like a question. She listens intently.

"I could take the Bloom from her," Matkina whispers. "It *wants* me to... Gods! What could I *do* with this power?" She puts her knuckle in her mouth and bites down hard enough to draw blood.

"I won't. I *won't*. We have a better way. You and me, we're in this *together*." </DefaultText>

The memories come like a torrent, a flickering welter of hopes and dreams, fears and nightmares, drawing out his experiences and deadening his mind. Vital connections disappear, lost forever in the Bloom's insatiable hunger.</DefaultText>

... and you see the not-Erritises falling, pierced by javelins, impaled on a great thorn tree, devoured by beasts, vented into space, torn apart by a coruscation of energies...

Vital connections disappear in Erritis's mind, lost forever in the Bloom's insatiable hunger.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>More memories flicker past - her first kill, the rush of blood and adrenaline... her first lover, a clumsy boy who finished before she had even started... the countless sneers and japes at her white skin... so many reminders of her *otherness* when all she wanted was to *belong*...

      <DefaultText>You skim through her adult years like images on a holographic projector. Her first dissection, her first vivisection, the endless striving against the expectations of her family, the proof that she could break free from their desires. You see her turn into herself, against herself, trying to *be* herself...

The flood of history slows. Callistege's mind has been subtly but irreparably diminished, her vital experiences sapped of immediacy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She smiles and bobs her head slightly. The First speaks to her, praising her scouting abilities. Hungry Bloom-tongues lap up this happiness, erasing it from Matkina's mind.

The First offers Matkina a new task - a specialist, working with another castoff named Tash. Matkina and Tash work well together, their talents complementing and enhancing the other's. But Matkina doesn't quite trust him...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You recognize the man at once - it's Mazzof, the castoff artificer you met in Zerian Daywalker's Mere. Your first thought is that the Bloom has somehow tricked you, released the wrong man, but no... the Bloom's voices are insistent. 'Ishen' is Mazzof. The First Castoff concealed the truth from you to avoid arousing your suspicion.

For the moment, Mazzof is recovering from his ordeal, barely aware of his surroundings. He hasn't even seen you yet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You sense the remains of a transdimensional rift in the cyst - probably the same rift that the Bloom used to capture Ishen in the first place. It should be possible to reopen the rift and set him free, but the Bloom will *know* when you do.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You *whisper* softly to the rift, and it begins to take shape. Ishen stirs... and the knotted muscles that surround his cyst tremble with alarm. 

The Heart is slow to respond, thanks to your limited control of its functions. But as the rift is about to open, thousands of chittering voices hiss in rage. They rock the cyst to and fro, causing the rift to unravel again.</DefaultText>
