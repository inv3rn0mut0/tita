      <DefaultText>She summons the crew, and when they have assembled she speaks to them for long moments in their own tongue. Her face shines; you hear gasps and cries of muted praise. Some weep openly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This careworn woman is dressed in strange, ornate armor. Her bearing is military-stiff, and her eyes roam constantly, though the rest of her body is under strict control. She assesses you in a glance.

"Outworlder. The Bloom portal is open? It is good that you speak... spoke to me first. Few lascars speak your tongue. Officers, mainly." She clucks her tongue. "We need practice. Welcome to the Anchorage."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We lived here, on the Anchorage, as did our ancestors for countless generations. Trapped here, they grew old, intermarried, raised families. Our laws came one by one as we built a new society here in isolation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She smiles slightly. "We are not searching for any port that will take refugees. We await the Ship that will come for us. Our tradition tells us that Home has not forgotten us, and that we will one day breathe its air again. Until we can reach Home, we will not."

She chuckles. "Could you summon the Ship to us or create a pathway to our native land, we would depart gladly. But not until then."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks at you strangely for a moment, as if she had no idea of what you spoke, and then comprehension comes. "Ah! The signal! For so long have I heard it I have forgotten. We call for the Ship. Perhaps it has become lost. If so, we light a beacon in the Void."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Void is great and vast. It holds terrors. Monsters and pirates. The Anchorage is... respite. A place of rest and safety. There were once many Ships with many people.

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "I do not think so. We lived here many many years, but if we built the Anchorage, no memories remain. They tell us only that we serve. Perhaps it was built by our people. Perhaps it was always here. We do not know."

I delegate, as captains did before me. So we have pilots, majors, jemadars, and others. They prove themselves through work, rise through ranks." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As long as necessary, outworlder." She stops, re-translating your words. "Apologies. We have waited for many families, many parents. My family. Their family, and their family, and back many families before them. The Cortex would know, surely. But I do not think we wait much longer. Something in the Anchorage's air... it smells of our time here coming to an end. The Ship will come soon."</DefaultText>

She spreads her hands wide. "Until that day, we toil. When the Ship comes, and it comes soon, it will find a welcome berth in our Anchorage and in our hearts."</DefaultText>

When it comes, the Anchorage will be ready. I will have the honor of leading my people Home. If not me, my successor. But I feel... I feel it will be me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The messenger arrives, and he can barely contain his rage. He makes a quiet report to the captain, and they both glance at you as he does.

When he finishes, he stands behind the captain. She squares her shoulders and says, "Our most precious resource is gone. In all these long centuries have we held the Cortex dear, and in all that time it has sat in the great chamber. Now - with your arrival - it is missing."

She looks at her guards. They nod. She continues: "Give us back our Cortex."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At last she finishes her speech. The lascars gather their belongings and line up outside the portal to the Bloom. The captain seeks you out.

"Outlander, whatever lies beyond the Bloom is the place we call home. We are in your debt." She presses a device made of synth, studded with flashing lights, into your hand. "May this serve you well."

She follows her crew out the portal.

      <DefaultText>She exhales, teeth clenched, and looks up. Fury wavers like a trapped flame behind her eyes.

"We were not always so protective. That was before other outworlders tried to steal it a few years ago."

She holds up a hand. "Perhaps you are different. This does not matter. No outworlder will ever be allowed to see the Cortex again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She growls, sweeping a hand over her head. Clearly, she regrets broaching the topic at all. 

"We were foolish. They came to us through a portal from your world. We welcomed them as guests and showed them the Anchorage. The Cortex."

Her hand is a fist at her side. "One of them *put hands on it*. His friends attacked us. The Anchorage. Burning the walls with their fire."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Shaking her head, she continues. "We killed them, of course. All except the one who touched the Cortex. Him, we questioned until he died screaming a word over and over."

She watches your face. "The word was 'Dracogen.'"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Janur claps her hands over her ears, hesitates, then drops them, eyeing you balefully.

"Do not share the memories of fallen Lascars with others. It is not done. Understand?" She stares to your left, weighing her response, and continues. "Let her secrets die inside you. As I say before, outworlders are not allowed near the Cortex."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her gaze flicks down to the helm in your hands, and back up. She draws in a long, controlled breath.  

"Achilli. I knew she was lost to us, but I take no pleasure in it. Thank you, outworlder. Her family will be glad to have it back once you surrender it to me."

She lifts her eyebrows expectantly. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Disgust flashes across her stony face and is just as quickly suppressed. 

"I do not wish to hear of her private memories. Her thoughts are hers and should die with her." The last sentence has a lilt to it, as if Janur is quoting verse.

The hard line of her mouth softens then. "Achilli was intelligent. Adventurous. But prone to wild theories. Do not worry about her 'important discovery'. Let it fade with her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, but not immediately. First, I will erase the private memories inside it, as is tradition. Then, I will clean it. Perform maintenance rituals. After, the helm will be given to her eldest sibling."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gives you a hard look. "No. You can not *scavenge* through her memories because the helm is not tuned to you. And besides, it is forbidden..."

She falters, her mouth hanging open. "I had this conversation once before. I had it with Achilli." The corner of her mouth twitches, but she does not speak for a long, long moment. 

"Fine," she says, sweeping a hand over her eyes. "It would make her happy to know that her helm is carried by someone with her curiosity. Take it with her blessings." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Staring at the ceiling, tongue caught between her teeth, Janur twisted her wrist once. Twice. You hear a soft, firm, *clack*, and she holds it before her. 

"It is done. Achilli's memories are gone. Her family can take it without shame."

She squints at the soiled helm in her hands and winces. "*Ayu*. When it is clean, of course. This will take time. What else can I answer for you?"</DefaultText>
