      <DefaultText>Three tubes spill a foul bile into a rancid, swirling morass. Somewhere at the bottom of the pool, there must be a drain.

You can hear a faint, faint thudding, like that of an overgrown heart. Each time it beats, the surface of the pool ripples slightly.

      <DefaultText>Now that you have entirely blocked the liquid that drained into the pool, you've revealed a human-sized hole at the bottom. A drumbeat like a colossal heart sounds from below, echoing through the Gullet.

      <DefaultText>You've blocked two of the tubes that fed the pool, and the level of the swirling fluid has dropped considerably. Closing the final tube might let you access the drain directly. 

The beating heart is louder than ever.

      <DefaultText>You've managed to block one of the tubes, and the level of bilious fluid in the pool seems to have lowered significantly. The other two tubes continue to fill it, though - it's clear that you'll need to close them if you want to access whatever hole the fluid drains into.

You can hear a sound like a heartbeat from underneath the water. It's muffled by the water, but it's clearly audible from here.

      <DefaultText>The obedient rope that you tied to one of the tube clusters is just long enough to allow you to climb through the gaping hole and into the chamber below.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grasp the rope, and you can feel its texture adjusting itself to your hands - soft but firm, with fibers that grip your flesh. Your descent is quick, safe, and painless, though you have to let go of the rope to drop the last meter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You lean in close to sniff the fluid and quickly pull your head back before you vomit... though perhaps a touch of vomit would improve the stench. 

The fluid reminds you of rotten flesh, bile, half-digested meat, and a mixture of rusting metal and... lightning?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hold your nose shut and take a sip of the noisome liquid. It coats your mouth and throat and *burns* like acid in your gut. Atrocities fill your mind's eye - rape, murder, flayings, cannibalism, and worse. So much worse.

You vomit, and the fluid burns more as it exits your body.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You tentatively dip a finger into the foul stew. The fluid is both gritty and slimy, and it burns when it touches bare flesh. You quickly snatch your finger away and wipe it on your clothes.</DefaultText>
