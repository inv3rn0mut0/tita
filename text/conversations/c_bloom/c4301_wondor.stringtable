      <DefaultText>As you approach this bulk of stone and fur, it starts to move, becoming less of an inanimate object and more of a man. Before you stands a giant figure with a beard so thick it seems like sculpted granite. But when you see his gentle eyes, a tangible wave of peace washes over you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gentle confusion crinkles the mutant's stony brow, making a sound like boulders shifting against one another.  

"It is me, Adahn," he says slowly. "Wondor. Perhaps it has been too long. Perhaps you do not remember me."  

His shoulders sag as he says this. </DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No," Wondor says, scowling down at you. "But I want you to go away. Looking at you makes me unhappy. Looking at you makes me question why you helped me. It makes me wonder if I am better as I am now."

He scrapes his teeth together, shedding sparks. "I do not think I am."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Better than before," he says shyly. "Better than before we met. Then, there was sadness in me. Rage and sadness, fed by my many thoughts. But you found the stranger inside me and took it out."

He spreads his rocky palms. "Since that day, I have felt peace."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You took the stranger away from me," he says, his brow shifting. "You took the sadness and the rage away."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I do not know," he says, shaking his head back and forth four deliberate times. "But it entered my head in the accident. It was heavy, like a golden stone. It made my thoughts faster, but sharper. They made me sad. They made me angry."

The warmth of his smile ripples across his face. "But you told me you could help. You took out the device. Took away the dangerous thoughts, leaving me calm."

Simple joy fills his eyes. "You said you had more use for thoughts than I did."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A device in my head that made me think. You took it from me to help me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He folds his rough hands together. 

"Do you need anything else from me, Adahn?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They are hard for me to remember now," he says carefully. "But it was my voice. 'You should not have left them,' it said. 'They are gone because of you,' it said. 'You must learn from this,' it said."

He shifts uneasily. "But when I tried to learn from the thoughts, they increased. They shouted. They would not leave me alone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wondor turns ponderously to stare at the man, who stands some distance away, for several long moments.

"Of course," he says, nodding so forcefully that his body sways. "Anything for you, Adahn. Anything. I will join you when you speak to him next."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't remember. The stranger held the memories and the pain, and the stranger is gone." Gratitude warms his face. "You took it."</DefaultText>
