      <DefaultText>"Confront my fear? Show it that I'm not afraid of it? Are you sure you aren't one of my soldiers' well-meaning mother?" He stops to think. "Though aside from the occasional beating, my mother did have some good advice." He makes a decision, and suddenly he stands taller and stronger. You can see the warrior that he once must have been.

      <DefaultText>The peals of laughter that spill from his lips render him nearly helpless for a moment. He finds this so funny that he drops his flagon and doesn't seem to care. As his laughter subsides, he bends over to pick up his flagon and refills it from the nearby cask. He slaps you on the back. "Excellent jest, my friend. Excellent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He bursts out laughing. "You are truly the soul of wit. You're not a bad sort for a castoff. Not at all." He takes another hearty gulp of rum, and this brow furrows. "You're also dead right. For a change."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He listens to your argument, and he seems to be deep in thought. Then he slams his flagon down and shouts, "Yes!" He brushes off his pants: "It's time I face these fears. Why live in the shadow of terror?"

      <DefaultText>"This? This is Astarian rum, one of the finest and deadliest concoctions I've found in my travels across this land. It's like being smothered in a blanket of soft fur and drowned in love. It can strip the gloss off just about any material you care to name, too." He takes a hefty swig. "And it's not for the weak.

      <DefaultText>It burns on the way down. He wasn't kidding about its harsh qualities, but he failed to mention the acrid sting it puts in your nose. Tears spring to your eyes, but you manage to swallow it all.

Artaglio beams broadly. "Have another?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>You raise the cup to your lips and swallow, and it feels like someone poured acid across your teeth. Tears spring unbidden to your eyes, and you barely manage to swallow instead of vomiting.

Artaglio laughs. "Like I said: it's not for the weak."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>You take the cup in your hand, and with a smooth motion swallow its contents in a single gulp. You can feel it burning in your throat and in your stomach, but you control your body's reflexes and show no outward sign of your discomfort.

Artaglio whistles approvingly. "Have another?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The offensive taste of the rum is matched only by its potent bite, and you are unable to keep it in your mouth. You spew your mouthful on the ground, and the nearby mercenaries laugh at your discomfort.

"Like I said: it's not for the weak." he turns back to his mercenaries and begins a tall tale.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It doesn't go down any easier than the first. In fact, it's a little tougher. But you manage to choke it down, and though your stomach rebels, you're able to keep it under control.

"Most people can't drink one mug, let alone two. Even these brave soldiers - " he gestures to the crowd around him, irony inflecting his voice, " - even these mighty warriors find it hard going. But you? I challenge you to match me, and I'll match you. Put that vaunted castoff constitution to the test."</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>He laughs as the acrid drink binds up your throat. You're unable to finish your second cup, and in any event the mercenary doesn't offer you any more. He salutes you, and turns back to regale his soldiers with a story.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>Not only do you swallow one mug, you reach past Artaglio and refill the cup, downing its contents as well. Artaglio looks at you with a new respect - or perhaps it's fear?

"All right, friend. Time to put that vaunted castoff constitution to the test. Match me, and I'll match you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're unable to hold the liquor in your stomach, and it turns out you're unable to keep your lunch there either. Everything burns just as badly coming up as it did going down. Artaglio and his mercenaries roar with laughter. He turns back to his coterie to continue a story.</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>You're not sure how much you've had to drink, but Artaglio is as good as his word, matching you shot for shot. At last, though, he aims a drink for his face, misses, and falls to the ground howling with laughter. His troops cheer you and share laughter at his expense.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>You lose count of the number of drinks you have, but Artaglio matches you, just as he said he would. In the end, his long experience with the rum wins out, and you find yourself slumping to the floor. His troops give you a friendly jeer, and Artaglio turns back to them with another story.</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>You remain unaffected by the alcohol, but Artaglio is slumping further and further toward the ground. He drops the last half-meter in an instant, knocking over his cup. His troops hoot and holler, and they cheer your success.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gathers himself at last, pulling himself from the ground, and says, "Castoff, you are better than any other of your kind I've ever met. From this day forth, we are mug brothers. Mug brothers! You get one favor from me - ask quick, before I forget."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take the first shot and the accumulated effects of all the alcohol catch up with you at once. Your head spins, your stomach clenches, and you barely manage to avoid splashing yourself with vomit.

      <DefaultText>The conversations around the Slump die down. Artaglio's soldiers look at you, at each other, at their commander, and at the standard that Artaglio takes from you and unfurls. He unfolds it reverently, momentarily taking his eyes from the Maw. The standard is stained from the murdens' trash heap, bloody, and torn, but he holds it as if it were an infant.

His face and voice lose their ironic, cynical edge. "I am in your debt, castoff. Truly I am. Name your price."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stiffens noticeably, and the good cheer drains from his face. His eyes sharpen, no sign of drink in them now, and he studies you carefully to see if you jest with him. He looks around at the soldiers, who have fallen silent, and he sighs.

He stands. "My soldiers! Time to see how a man faces his fears!" He turns to the Maw, and as he begins his walk, he mutters out of the corner of his mouth, "I knew a castoff would be the death of me. Knew it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods solemnly and enters his tent. Therein, he uncovers a small chest that is festooned with locks both mechanical and mystical and performs some sleight of hand. The chest opens for him, and he scoops out large handfuls of shins.

"The debt is paid, my friend. You have my gratitude."

      <DefaultText>The features of this once-handsome man are sunken and splotchy, the face of anxiety and drink, evidenced by the flagon in his hand. The veins of his nose have broken, giving it a rosy appearance. Any cheer that might have lived in his face is destroyed by the frequent nervous glances over his shoulder. Following his gaze, you see a mass of Bloom-tongues some distance away. He looks you over, his eyes lingering on your castoff tattoo.

He takes a slow, deliberate drink.</DefaultText>
