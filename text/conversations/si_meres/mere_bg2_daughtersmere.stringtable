      <DefaultText>You're in a glass dome, several kilometers above the ground. Blue sky fills your vision. Beneath you is a floor of golden metal. A deafening klaxon blares in warning against... something.

A familiar-looking stasis chamber lies in the center of the dome. A chest fashioned from synth and cold iron sits to one side. Behind the pod, a diamond hovers in the air, scattering prismatic light. A pedestal glows near your hand, a deep azure blue. 

There is nothing that seems to warrant the blaring klaxons, yet you know the alarm sounds for a reason.

{SOUND: Blaring klaxons, with an interval of maybe 2 seconds (something slightly annoying but not super annoying). This is an ambient sound that continues throughout this Mere until (and unless) the player turns them off in node 139.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's a stasis chamber - the same as the one you saw in the dreamlike laboratory minutes ago. There is a girl inside, maybe twenty years old. Her skin is pale and there are dark circles around her eyes. Her face is exactly like the ghostly woman from in the calm of your mind. Her chest rises and falls as though she were sleeping soundly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly a man appears between you and the chamber. He's not all there - you can see the clouds and vista on the other side of him. His hands are raised in front of him placatingly. "Hey, what are you doing? If you open that, Miika will die!"

His mannerisms remind you of the Specter from the Labyrinth, though his face, clothing, and voice are not the same.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You find the panel mentioned in the archives. Once you know where it is, it slides open easily. You place your hand on the black glass inside. It grows warm at your touch, and there is the smell of a light rain.

A low hum murmurs at the edge of your hearing, and the air outside the dome begins to shimmer. The shield appears spherical. You can only hope it will buy you some time against what's coming.

"The Dalad people are believed to have existed long before the Ninth World. 'Dalad' is probably not what they called themselves. Their true name is unknown. They made great use of a force referred to in these archives as 'the Tides,' using them especially to affect individual psyches. The civilization of the Dalad did not decline but was completely wiped out by a creature called the Sorrow."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>So the Sorrow must have destroyed the Dalad because of how they abused the Tides. If the weapon that caused Miika's illness was from this same civilization, then it stands to reason her illness is Tidal in nature - like a Tidal Surge perhaps.

If so, maybe there's some way you can undo it. The spectral adviser might know more.</DefaultText>

The spectral adviser paces back and forth, though his feet never actually touch the ground. "Could an equivalent Surge undo the effects? No, that would require more power than either of your bodies are capable of generating."

He stops and looks at you excitedly. "But I think you've discovered an exciting path of inquiry. It may take a few years, but..." The laboratory rumbles and quakes as the Sorrow pounds away below. "Never mind. We don't have years. In a few minutes, we won't have *anything*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a thunderous boom. The floor shakes and sways beneath you, causing you to lose your balance. Outside the dome, the horizon tilts back and forth, giving you a sense of vertigo.

The spectral man appears in front of you suddenly, a look of human terror on its face. "It's broken into the tower! It's only a matter of time before it reaches us here. We have to do something fast!"

The spectral man appears in front of you again. It puts its hands on your shoulders, though you feel nothing. "It *shattered* the electrostatic shield! If it breaks through the plasma window, we're done for."

The spectral man's image disappears. A foul black cloud rises from the hatch, and the air is filled with an unearthly wail and the stench of rotting flesh. Tendrils lash out, slicing metal and synth wherever they touch it.

A terrible face emerges from the cloud. It examines you, then it turns its attention to the chamber.

In fury, the Sorrow's tendrils flay the laboratory all around it. The chest and diamond are cut to ribbons. The chamber disintegrates in a ball of purple flame, and the last thing you see as your mind fades from this body is the face of the young girl, melting and boiling into ash.

"I don't like it any more than you do. The only other options I can think of are to somehow stop the Sorrow by force - unlikely - or figure out what it wants." He shakes his translucent head. "I don't think we have enough time for either, but maybe you know something I don't."

He points to the hovering diamond. "Maybe you can find something in your archives to help us. Just be careful what you research in there. We don't have any time to waste."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a thunderous boom. The floor shakes and sways beneath you, causing you to lose your balance. Outside the dome, the horizon tilts back and forth, giving you a sense of vertigo.

Suddenly a man appears in front of you. He's not all there - you can see the clouds and vista on the other side of him. He wears a look of human terror on its face. "It's broken into the tower! It's only a matter of time before it reaches us here. We have to do something fast!"

His mannerisms remind you of the Specter from the Labyrinth, though his face, clothing, and voice are not the same.

      <DefaultText>You've only taken two steps when the Sorrow turns its horrible attention to you. One of its tendrils darts toward you, slicing through both the stronglass wall and steel floor. It reaches your face and...

You feel nothing. The tendril goes right through your body. You realize that the dome is fading away - no, your *body* is fading away as some device tugs it safely away to another location.

      <DefaultText>"You don't remember? I guess that's why you made me." He chuckles. Then his face grows serious. "You never tried to merge your consciousness with hers.

So we rejected that option and kept searching for some other way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "I'm afraid we can't. You rejected it before we could implement any kind of experiment. We'd need some kind of psychic substrate for your consciousness and hers to reside in simultaneously. Then we'd need a catalyst of some kind to create the resonance that would merge you with her. It's certainly possible, given time, but the Sorrow's at our doorstep!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Although your body is gone, your awareness somehow remains *here*, in the laboratory. The spectral adviser is gone, and the Sorrow breaks through the last defenses and up through the hatch. Its tendrils flay the laboratory all around it. The chest and diamond are cut to ribbons. The chamber disintegrates in a ball of purple flame, and the last thing you see as your mind fades from this body is the face of the young girl, melting and boiling into ash.</DefaultText>
