      <DefaultText>Afternoon sun streams through the balcony doors of a rich library, turning wooden bookshelves and white walls to gold. Books of every kind surround you, leatherbound tomes, Hikarian scent novels, moving picture books, jars of memory ants - all well maintained and neatly ordered. 

Heavy chest-high tables hold more books, and quiet nooks hide oversize chairs. A crimson-furred singing moth trills in a silver cage. 

At a desk, two tall white-haired men of a race you know as the Sona examine what looks like a jade button. 

"The Mindeye it's called," says the older Sona. "A fascinating toy. "Wear it and set it to "See" and it will capture all you experience - every sensation and emotion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Place it on someone else and set it to "Show," continues the old Sona, "and they experience everything you captured. A completely immersive experience."

"Remarkable, Lord Veresterios," says the younger sona. "And could you put it on an animal?"

"Certainly," says Veresterios. "A pet, an insect, even an emptyheaded Nil like little Rem here."

He turns and winks at you. "Would you like that Rem? Would you like to view librarian Lanalton's days? Would you like to know what it was like to be a Sona? To be a man? To be able to reach books on high shelves?"

It is then you realize the chairs are not oversize. You are a child sized, blue-skinned, full grown woman - a Nil. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Veresterios laughs. "I imagine you would! Who'd want the life of a Nil? Always picking up after a bunch of lazy snobs. What do you think, Librarian?"

Lanalton sniffs. "I meant the other way around, sir. Seeing through an animal's eyes, learning how it thinks. If it feels."

"Already done!" cries Veresterios. "I placed the eye on a Nil pot scrubber last week. Fascinating viewing, but dangerous." He pats a book on the desk. "Eosus' diary warns that auditing a mind too different from one's own can drive one mad. One may safely place the device on ones eye to experience just the visual, but more than that..." He shakes his head. "Even within the same race it is not without risk."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Veresterios smiles. "What a well mannered girl you are. Rem. If only all Nil were like you."

Lanalton sniffs and turns from you. "I meant the other way around, sir. Seeing through an animal's eyes, learning how it thinks. If it feels."

Lanalton sniffs and turns from you. "I meant the other way around, sir. Seeing through an animal's eyes, learning how it thinks. If it feels."

      <DefaultText>He locks the Mindeye in a drawer, then stands. "But enough of toys, Lanalton. I require your help. My son, Aurigan is just back from the steadfast, and he has it in his head that he wants to be a Nano. I want you to select some books for him. Come, he's to meet us in my office."

"One moment, my lord," says Lanalton, then turns to you. "You will file all the books on the table before I return." He points to Eosus's diary. "But do n't touch that one. It is worth all the rest combined. I will take care of it personally, understand?"

Before you can reply, he sweeps out after Veresterios and you are alone. The quiet, however, is quickly disturbed. Screams are coming from the balcony. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looking through the balcony door, you see a massive gray-skinned bodyguard - a Bayan - holding two struggling Nil over the balustrade, dangling them above a kilometer-wide hole so deep you can't see the bottom. Behind him, a handsome young Sona shouts at a third Nil, who kneels in a puddle of water before him, clutching a mop. 

"Murderous pipsqueak," snarls the young Sona. "I nearly fell down the Bore slipping in your slop!"

"I'm sorry, lord Aurigan," says the Nil. "I did put up a rope and a warning si--"

The Sona slaps his face. "Talking back? Just for that, Gurek will drop one of your friends. Quick now, drit. Pick left or right. And if you don't pick, all three of you go over!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Veresterios chuckles. "Too meek to express an opinion? No wonder the Nil never rise. They take whatever we dish out, and ask for seconds."

Lanalton sniffs and turns from you. "I meant the other way around, sir. Seeing through an animal's eyes, learning how it thinks. If it feels."

"Ah, yes," said Veresterios. "Fascinating, but dangerous." He pats a book on the desk. "Eosus' diary warns that auditing a mind too different from one's own can be so jarring as to drive one mad. It is possible to place the device on ones eye to safely experience just the visual component, but more than that..." He shakes his head.

      <DefaultText>As you race for the young lord, the gray-skinned man throws one of the Nil he's holding at you, and you both go down in a heap. 

The Sona turns on you. "Were you coming for me, girl? Don't you know striking a sona is a capital crime? Gurek, drop that runt over the side, then grab this one. She's next."

Gurek obediently opens his fist and the struggling Nil drops out of sight, shrieking, as the Nil with the mop sobs and clutches the sona's boots. "Please," he says. "No more."

Gurek reaches for you, but as his fingers close around you, Veresterios' voice comes from inside. 

"Aurigan, my boy! Where are you? We're waiting for you!"

      <DefaultText>Aurigan turns as you make your plea. 

"Look, Gurek. It's trying to mimic human speech."  He grabs you and pins your arms behind your back, then faces the Nil with the mop. "Now you have three to pick from, drit. Make your choice. Now!"

The Nil looks from you to the two Nil in Gurek's arms. Tears are streaming down his face. "Please, master. I... take me. Let them go and--"

"That wasn't a choice, fool!" snarls Aurigan. "Now--"

But before he can repeat himself, Veresterios' voice comes from inside.

"That wasn't a choice, fool!" snarls Aurigan, cuffing him over the ear. "Now--"

But before he can repeat himself, Veresterios' voice comes from inside. 

"Aurigan, my boy! Where are you! We're waiting for you!"

The young sona cringes, then shoves you away and beckons to Gurek. "Kill the left hand one. The old man calls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aurigan laughs as you make your threat. "You think my father cares what happens to livestock?"

He grabs you and pins your arms behind your back, then faces the Nil with the mop. "Now you have three to pick from, drit. Make your choice. Now!"

The Nil looks from you to the two Nil in Gurek's arms. Tears are streaming down his face. "Please, master. I... take me. Let them go and--"

      <DefaultText>The young sona cringes at his father's voice, then beckons to Gurek. "Leave it. The old man calls."

Gurek sets you down and follows his master as the three Nil cluster around you, steadying you. 

"You see, Rem?" says the one with the mop. "He's a monster. He had poor Dal killed for *nothing*. I..." He breaks down again, weeping.

"Coi's right," says the second Nil. "Him and that Bayan of his will kill us all. There's already three maids out with broken arms. And old Jai died of a cracked head last night."

Coi clutches your arm. "You promised you would help us, Rem, so please! You've got more freedom and smarts than any Nil we know. Find some way to... to make him stop."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Coi takes your hand. "Thank you, Rem. We're relying on you. Thank you. Let us know if you need any help."

The Nil gather up their mops and cleaning rags and leave you alone on the balcony, staring down into the wide hole of the Bore. Had things gone differently, it might have been you who was thrown into it. If you had, you'd still be falling.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Returning to the library, you start to put away the books on the table. You don't know the classification system, but it is simple enough, and all the books are in their proper places by the time Lanalton returns. 

He sniffs when he sees that you've finished, as if annoyed that he has no excuse to scold you. "Dust and polish for a while," he says. "Lord Veresterios is reading in his office, and I have work to do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you move around the library with your polishing rag you find, in a closet, three books on a low shelf, stacked beside a Nil-sized cloak. They are; The Laughing Jack - a Romance of Old Sagus Cliffs, The Jaws of Victory - A Memoir of the Endless Battle, and Another Man's Mirror - Lessons in Empathy. Each book has been bookmarked. It seems you have been reading. 

You also notice that Lanalton is so engrossed in his work that he ignores you completely. As long as you keep quiet and out of his line of sight, you can likely do anything - examine the moth, look at the priceless Diary of Eosus and learn more about the Mindeye, or sneak into the closet and read your chosen books. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fist-sized moth chirrups and flutters at you as you approach. It is a beautiful thing from afar, with its crimson coat and beautiful wing markings, but it's face is a bit unnerving. It has six eyes, widely spaced so that it can look in all directions at once, and the membrane behind its mandilbles - the organ that allows it to sing - glistens and vibrates in a stomach-churning way. 

If it could talk, it would certainly have a lot to say, for it sees everything that goes on in the library, night and day.

Verseterios is as kind a master as one could wish for, but he dotes on that boy and won't hear a word against him. The only thing that *might* turn him against him would be if Aurigan was fool enough to steal from the library."

      <DefaultText>It won't be easy. You'll have to trick Aurigan into stealing the Diary of Eosus, and then prove to Veresterios that his son was the thief. 

To do this, you'll need to put the Mindeye on the singing moth so it will record the theft. Then you'll need to convince Gurek to suggest to Aurigan that the book could cover his gambling debts and make him a fortune as well. But if Aurigan is kicked out, Gurek loses his job, so the easiest way to get the Bayan's cooperation is to find him a new employer. 

Finally, once you've got the evidence you need, you'll have to tell Veresterios about the theft. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Killing Aurigan shouldn't be too difficult, but killing him without implicating yourself or any of the other Nil is going to be tricky. 

Tricking Veresterios into thinking Aurigan commited suicide by jumping off the balcony seems like a viable plan, but pulling it off will require several steps. First, you'll need to convince the other Nil to help you, because he's too big to push over yourself. Second, you'll need to forge a suicide note. Third, you have to get Gurek away from Aurigan's door so you can sneak in and leave the note, then get him to chase you to the balcony where the other Nil will be waiting. 

Then all you'll have to do is push. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Making Aurigan a better person is the noblest plan, but it won't be easy, and it could lead to driving him mad if the proper steps aren't taken - even if they are. 

First, you'll need to steal the Mindeye and wear it for a week, recording all your waking and sleeping moments. Then you'll have to get Gurek away from Aurigan's room so you can sneak in and place the Mindeye behind Aurigan's ear, forcing him to experience a week's worth of being a Nil in a single night. And if you want to keep him from going mad, you'll have to dose him with alcohol once every hour and hope it's enough. 

Otherwise he might end up a gibbering lunatic and you wouldn't want that - or would you?</DefaultText>

You release the moth into the cage again and it flutters around, agitated, singing an angry song while you creep away, hands sprinkled with moth dust.

      <DefaultText>He leaps unsteadily at you, and you dart for the door. He stumbles after, snarling. "Come back here! Do you think this is a game? Gurek! Gurek, where are you?"

You run out the door and he follows, trying to catch his breath enough to shout, and you soon lead him to the balcony, where he stops, weaving and wheezing, and stares at the assembled Nil. 

"What is this?" he asks. "A party? Are you all star gazing?"

The Nil stare back at him, hesitating. You can see the fear in their eyes now that they're faced with the reality of the plan. It looks like they might run.

You turn it to the 'view' setting and speed it up.  Immediately he tenses and you can see his eyes moving behind his eyelids. His limbs start twitching too, and he begins murmuring under his breath.

      <DefaultText>Veresterios was very careful to lock the Mindeye in Lanalton's desk, but Lanalton is not very careful with the spare key. When he goes to the lavatory you easily unlock the desk drawer, take the Mindeye out, and relock the drawer, then place the spare key back where you found it.

The slights, the insults, the shoves, the casual threats, the stories of the other Nil, the fear of losing your job, the fear of dying to keep it, your dreams of freedom, your rage, your sorrow, your infrequent joys, your courage, your cowardice, your pettiness, your simple humanity. 

Several times during the week, Aurigan accosts you, leering, joking, insulting you, making unwanted advances, threatening you with violence. You wonder how he will react to being abused by himself.

      <DefaultText>With Gurek out of the way, entering Aurigan's room is as simple as opening the door.

It is a large, luxurious room, with a lessened-gravity bed hovering in one corner and beautiful works of art on the walls. There are also underclothes and dirty cups and plates scattered across the floor. The place is a mess.

Aurigan snores in the bed, face down and dead to the world. It would be the work of a moment to to place the Mindeye behind his ear.

Aurigan snatches the device from his father's hand, then watches it. A moment later his jaw drops, and he flings it from him. "How...? How...?"

Veresterios indicates you. "Rem put it on the moth. It saw all."

Aurigan turns on you, shaking. "You. You did this for vengeance, didn't you? Because I threatened your grubby little friends. Well, I'll kill you for it. It's the Bore for you, you little tattle tale!"

He'd already got half of us killed in the Dool thanks to his cowardice and shilly-shallying, and his decision at Bresadt proved he hadn't gained any wisdom since. The only question was how to do it. Outright murder would get us all the chop, and the higher-ups were wise to the usual friendly-fire and "accidental" ordinance malfunction ploys. We had to be subtle.  

Then Gerrisae hit on it. We'd all heard Hyrnhal moaning about his wife leaving him, and so had the brass. If we wrote a note in his hand saying her betrayal had driven him to the brink, well, who'd gainsay it?

      <DefaultText>Do not attempt to view another's experiences while under the influence of stimulants, particularly at elevated viewing speeds. Tea, wakeleaf, haffa juice, all make it harder for the mind to accept the experiences of another mind as one's own, and this can lead to madness and death. Indeed, the best way to insure the sanity of the user is to administer small doses of intoxicants hourly until the viewing is complete.

"Lanalton," he says. "Send for my son."

A few moments later, Aurigan slouches into the library, looking put out, with Gurek behind him. "What is it?" he asks. "I was busy."

"Rem has a plan," says Coi. "She's going to forge a suicide note. It'll look like Aurigan killed himself."

The Nil murmur anxiously, debating in whispers. 

Coi raises his voice. "We've been lucky so far. Only a few beatings and broken bones, but you know it won't last. Him or his Bayan will kill one of us eventually. Are you willing to just let it happen?"

The Nil will not be convinced. They are too afraid. You're either going to have to attempt to kill Aurigan by yourself, or try another plan.

      <DefaultText>For a week you wear the Mindeye, recording every moment of your life - the drudgery, the abuses, both minor and major, from your Sona masters and their Bayan enforcers. The slights, the insults, the shoves, the casual threats, the stories of the other Nil, the fear of losing your job, the fear of dying to keep it, your dreams of freedom, your rage, your sorrow, your infrequent joys, but because you read Another Man's Mirror, you are able to maintain a forgiving attitude through it all. 

Several times during the week, Aurigan accosts you, leering, joking, insulting you, making unwanted advances, threatening you with violence. You wonder how he'll react to being abused by himself.

      <DefaultText>"I promise you," he says. "That will change. I have spent too long thinking only *I* had a mind, only I knew pain. My father's Nil need never fear me again. And you..." He raises his eyes to yours. "Who risked all to teach me this, I will have you as my teacher, my guide in the ways of an enlightened life, and together we will find a way to free the Nil from their bondage. We make Haref a city of freedom and equality at last."

As he bows to you, the walls of his room blur into a red haze, and something like a hot fist clenches your guts and wrenches you bodily out of the world. Aurigan and the pink sky beyond his windows all vanish into silent darkness.

      <DefaultText>Though you fear he might wake, you ease Aurigan over on his back and pull gently on his chin, opening his mouth. This does not jar him out of his immersive dream, and you are able to dribble a bit of haffa juice into his mouth. He swallows it reflexively, and after a minute his twitching and moaning increases. He begins to whimper. 

A little while later, you hear Gurek return to his post outside the door, and you hide. He looks in on Aurigan, pauses as he sees him so restless, then shrugs and backs out again. </DefaultText>

Before you can try to silence him, Gurek slams through the door and looks around. Aurigan points directly at you. "It was her! She put the Nil in my head! I have to get them out! I have to--"

He sceams again and snatches a dagger from his bedside table, then races for the door. Gurek tries to stop him but Aurigan dodges around him, then calls back to him. "This way! To the servant's quarters! We'll start there!"</DefaultText>

It is a beautiful thing from afar, with its crimson coat and beautiful wing markings, but its face is a bit unnerving. It has six eyes, widely spaced so that it can look in all directions at once, and the membrane behind its mandibles - the organ that allows it to sing - glistens and vibrates in a stomach-churning way. 

If it could talk, it would certainly have a lot to say, for it sees everything that goes on in the library, night and day. </DefaultText>

One piece of paper seems to be notes - written by you? - outlining various ways to remove Aurigan from Veresterios' house. The others are a note from Aurigan, written and signed by him, telling someone named Hekeria he never wants to see her again, and several pages of attempts - also by you? - to copy both Aurigan's handwriting and his signature. It seems you've been working on the problem of Aurigan for a while. </DefaultText>

Outright murder would get us all the chop, and the higher-ups were wise to the usual friendly-fire and "accidental" ordinance malfunction ploys. We had to be subtle.*  

*Then Gerrisae hit on it. We'd all heard Hyrnhal moaning about his wife leaving him, and so had the brass. If we wrote a note in his hand saying her betrayal had driven him to the brink, well, who'd gainsay it?*

      <DefaultText>It won't be easy. You'll have to trick Aurigan into stealing the Diary of Eosus, and then prove to Veresterios that his son was the thief. 

To do this, you'll need to put the Mindeye on the singing moth so it will record the theft. Then you'll need to convince Gurek to suggest to Aurigan that the book could cover his gambling debts and make him a fortune as well. But if Aurigan is kicked out, Gurek loses his job, so the easiest way to get the Bayan's cooperation is to find him a new employer. 

Finally, once you've got the evidence you need, you'll have to tell Veresterios about the theft. </DefaultText>

Unfortunately, while you searched, Aurigan broke Coi's collar bone by shoving him down the stairs, and blackened the eyes of a maid.

      <DefaultText>The men stare at you, stunned, then Lanalton snarls. "You lying runt! I don't believe you! It must be here!"

"Aye," says Veresterios. "Find it!"

Though you know it's pointless, you help them search the shelves and tables. You find nothing. 

Veresterios turns on you. "You said you know who did this? Who was it?"

You tell him that, having recently suspected intruders in the library, you put the Mindeye on the singing moth in the hope it might see who was skuling around. 

"How dare you use such a valuable device without permission!" shouts Lanalton. "You shall be whipped!"

"Never mind about that," says Veresterios. "Bring me the device. I must see!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With careful hands, Lanalton takes the Mindeye off the moth and hands it to Veresterios. The old sona puts it to his eye and twists it to speed up the viewing. For a long time, he just watches, then he stops it, twists it back and watches a short section again. His face sags and he lowers the Mindeye to his lap. 

"Lanalton," he says. "Send for my son."

A few moments later, Aurigan slouches into the library, looking put out, with Gurek behind him. "What is it?" he asks. "I was busy."

Veresterios shakes his head. "I have forgiven you much, Aurigan. Blamed much on your youth. But that you would steal from your own father. That is too much. You are no longer my son."</DefaultText>

Veresterios holds out the Mindeye. "Put it to your eye and twist it one click to the right. You will see he who has condemned you."

Aurigan snatches the device from his father's hand, then watches it. A moment later his jaw drops, and he flings it from him. "How...? How...?"

Veresterios indicates you. "Rem put it on the moth. It saw all."

Aurigan turns on you, shaking. "You. You did this for vengeance, didn't you? Because I threatened your grubby little friends. Well, I'll kill you for it. It's the Bore for you, you little tattle tale!"

Veresterios stands over his son. "I see now you are everything the Nil said you were. Gurek, remove this trash from my house, and take the girl too.

      <DefaultText>Killing Aurigan shouldn't be too difficult, but killing him without implicating yourself or any of the other Nil is going to be tricky. 

Tricking Veresterios into thinking Aurigan commited suicide by jumping off the balcony seems like a viable plan, but pulling it off will require several steps. First, you'll need to convince the other Nil to help you, because he's too big to push over yourself. Second, you'll need to forge a suicide note. Third, you have to get Gurek away from Aurigan's door so you can sneak in and leave the note, then get him to chase you to the balcony where the other Nil will be waiting. 

Then all you'll have to do is push. </DefaultText>

Only a few beatings and broken bones, but you know it won't last. Him or his Bayan will kill one of us eventually. Are you willing to just let it happen?"

Several times during the week, Aurigan accosts you, leering, joking, insulting you, making unwanted advances, threatening you with violence. You wonder how he'll react to being abused by himself.

It is a large, luxurious room, with a lessened-gravity bed hovering in one corner and beautiful works of art on the walls. There are also underclothes and dirty cups and plates scattered across the floor. The place is a mess.

Aurigan snores in the bed, face down and dead to the world. It would be the work of a moment to to place the Mindeye behind his ear.

      <DefaultText>Just as dawn begins to color the sky outside Aurigan's windows, the Mindeye chirps to indicate that it has shown him all the Nil's experiences. 

You peel it from behind his ear and sneak for the door, hoping that it worked, and that Gurek is asleep outside. A voice behind you turns you around. It's Aurigan.

"You little bitch," he says, sitting up in bed and glaring groggily at you. "That's right. I know what you did, and why you did it. It was all in what you showed me, what you tried to turn me into." He shudders. "By the makers, it took everything I had to maintain my *self* in that endless Nil nightmare."

You showed me that they too have hearts and minds. You however..." He raises burning eyes to yours. "The violation you subjected me to was worse than any crime I have ever committed. And you will pay for it - with your life."

As he pounces on you and drags you to the open window, the walls of his room blur into a red haze, and something like a hot fist clenches your guts and wrenches you bodily out of the world. Aurigan and the pink sky and the Bore that yawns below you as he throws you out of the room all vanish into silent darkness.
