      <DefaultText>Silver rain pours down on a cratered wasteland, beating endlessly on your headgear, and turning the road into a red slurry that cakes onto your boots and your leggings. Trudging behind you are thirty miserable soldiers - glaives, mostly - all as soaked as you are, and all as heavily laden with weapons and gear. Six are even more weighed down, lugging between them a heavy crate that makes them plunge shin-deep in the muck with every step. 

The only person without a pack walks behind you, flanked by the company's toughest veterans - a scrawny Aeon Priest, whose robes are somehow neither wet nor muddy, but who seems more put out by the rain than anyone else. {VOICE: I think "Aeon Priest" should be sneered a bit.} {SOUND: Heavy rain, troops marching through mud, Rain can be constant throughout the whole mere.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vostiel rides the skimmer up the column, then turns it over to a groom and steps to you, pulling off his goggles and saluting smartly. He's got a grin on his face. 

"You're luck's holding, captain," he says. "First your win at dares and now this. Just intercepted one of the other side's couriers and found an interesting dispatch on his body after I killed him. Seems the unit that's holding the Silver Monolith has been reduced to a strength of ten by an attack from a rogue construct. They downed the metal beast, but it near to wiped them."

He glances at your lieutenant. "Landi will of course object, but if we were to move fast, we could secure it before the enemy even knows it's threatened. And wouldn't that be a feather in your cap. Command's been wanting that vantage for nigh on a year."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before you can issue a command, beams of light sizzle from the rusted corpse of a massive titan-class battle construct lying in the trenches to your left. More fire comes from either side of it. Strangely, however, all the beams lance over your heads.

"Ambush!" shouts Landi. "Find cover!"

"To hell with cover! Let's take 'em!" cries Vostiel.

A voice interrupts them, amplified by some crude and screechy artifact. "Send THE PRIest anD THE NUmenERA TO US ANd youR MEn will BE SPArED. DeFY US And all wiLL DIE."

The Aeon Priest squeals from where he lies curled up on the ground. "Don't you dare give me up, you filth! I'm worth more than all your insignificant lives combined!"

      <DefaultText>One of Vostiel's scouts rides off into the rain and the company settles in, the men sitting on their packs or else patrolling the battlefield in wide circles around you. 

Though Vostiel assures you the monolith is only a few kilometers away, the scout fails to return after an hour. You can wait no longer. The evening is turning the rain from silver to slate, and soon the endless trenches and dead constructs that flank the road will vanish beyond your lights. But as you stand to give an order, you hear a cry from one of the patrols, swiftly silenced. 

"What was that?" asks Vostiel. "I better go check."

"You'll wait for orders, curse you," says Landi. "Captain, what should we do?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vostiel sighs. "Thought you had more spirit, captain, but fair enough. Command it is."

He falls in, and the company starts forward once more, with Landi trying not look smug, and the little Aeon Priest grumbling about unnecessary stops and a lack of concern for his safety.

      <DefaultText>Though you can see that Vostiel is disappointed, he passes your orders on to his squads without question, just as Vandi does, and under their direction, your company retreats into the trenches to the right of the road with disciplined speed. They are so quick in fact, that the ambushers barely have to time to get off a few quick shots before your soldiers are all taking up defensive positions. Only two men are hit, and neither seriously.

      <DefaultText>Your lieutenants grumble but obey, and have the artifact uncrated and on its mount in a few moments. 

"Everyone back!" cries the priest as he steps up behind it. 

Even you take an involuntary step back as he depresses the firing arm and sweeps the thing's muzzle across the enemies positions. 

For a long moment, nothing happens, and Vostiel chuckles derisively off to one side. Then, with the roar of a hundred thunderstorms, every one of the ambushers' weapons explodes at once. The heater, the beamers, the launcher rounds, all unleash their payloads in a single second. Flames billow. Electricity sizzles. Clouds of poison and acid and hallucinogens spread in a multicolored fog. {SOUND: Sonic occilator weapon, followed by Huge Multi Explosion.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vostiel whoops as you and he and your four best skirmishers dive into the trenches to the left of the road.

"Now we'll show 'em!" he shouts. 

Behind you, Landi and the rest of the company pull back to the trenches to the right of the road, dragging the complaining priest with them. They hunker down and fire slugs and sizzling rays across at the ambushers, distracting them and allowing you and Vostiel and your squad to run through the left hand trenches toward the shattered construct.

      <DefaultText>As it begins to circle the monolith, you note that the construct is missing an arm and half its plating, and it moves like a crippled yovok, which is encouraging, unforunately, if the lights gleaming in its head are any indication, its long range weapon system is still operational, and that is *not* encouraging. 

Vostiel turns to you and lowers his voice. "That construct changes things. The dead-eye beamer in its head has the range and power to burn us down no matter where we strike, and if its targeting system is functional, it never misses. If we can't take it out right up front, we might as well go back home."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a half-hour march, you and your squad reach the monolith and creep toward it on elbows and knees. It juts up over a low rise, a silver slab of synthsteel four times the height of a man, sheared off at the top like a knife blade snapped off in someone's gut. You've never known why both sides consider the thing important, but reputations and promotions have been won for taking and holding it, and that's all that matters. 

You spot ten enemy soldiers guarding the monolith, four huddled beside it in a makeshift enclosure made of rags and pitted plates of synth, and six more out in the rain, patrolling in pairs. All are talking to each other on aether-coms. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your squad slips between the patrols and spreads out wide behind a long low ridge so that, if the construct gets a shot off it won't kill all of you at once. Your troops also mine the approaches to their positions, for when the other squad launches their inevitable counterattack. 

When everyone's in position, you give a hand signal command, and the entire squad pours fire at the construct's front legs, where its armor is most damaged, and which will cause it to fall flat on its face if they succeed, making it much harder to bring its big guns to bear. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your squad slips between the patrols and spreads out behind a low ridge so the construct will have a harder time killing them all at once. They also mine the approaches to their positions in preparation for the inevitable counterattack. 

When all are in position, you give the signal, and the entire squad pours fire at the construct's front legs, where its synth plating is most damaged, hoping to collapse it. The construct's front legs buckle, and it topples.

Unfortunately, in the second that it takes it to fall on its face, it spits three beams in three different directions and half your squad is dead, burning like candles. {SOUND: Robot's Powerful Beam Weapon}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pulling singularity detonators from your bandoliers, you and Vostiel slip through the enemy patrols and wait at the crest of a low ridge until the construct has gone behind the monolith, then you creep over. 

And that is how you proceed for the next half hour. Moving only when the monolith blocks the construct's motion sensors, then laying still as it limps around for another pass. 

Finally, you're within throwing range, and as the hulking mantis comes into view once more, you key your aether-com to signal the squad. At the click, they start firing from behind the ridge, drawing the eyes of both the construct and the troopers in the enclosure. Now's your chance!

      <DefaultText>The only person not heavily burdened walks directly behind you, flanked on either side by the company's biggest and most veteran soldiers. He is a small man in the robes of an Aeon Priest, which are somehow neither wet nor muddy, despite the weather. He carries nothing but a small satchel, slung over one shoulder, and walks with a lightness of step that makes you grunt with envy, yet he seems more put out by the rain than anyone else. 

"Why was I not retrieved in a vehicle?" he asks you. "Why am I being escorted home by rag-tag trench fodder with antique weapons. If this is what Command thinks of my work, maybe I should sell it to the other side!"</DefaultText>

The woman marching beside you sighs. She has a lieutenant's pips on her tunic, and a scar on her right cheek from temple to jaw. "No vehicles available," she says. "And no other companies. Thanks to the Chalcedon's assault, every other company fit to fight is marching straight for Ansau."

With a curse, one of the men carrying the priest's package sinks to his waist in the mud. The column stops while the soldiers try to extricate him. Your lieutenant stands at attention. The priest watches with a smirk.</DefaultText>

He hesitates for a moment, then continues, much more subdued. "It seems the shielding had a flaw that presented itself when the weapon heated up.

You pause at an intersection of trenches. The enemy is in three squads. The squad to the left is launching explosive shells across the road into your company. The squad to the right is moving forward through the maze, laying down pinning fire as they come.

By the light of their glowglobe you can see there are only four of them, a spotter, a gunner, a loader, and a sergeant barking orders. None of them are looking your way.

      <DefaultText>Working your way through the maze of trenches, you find a position just below and to the left of the construct that gives you a perfect vantage on the heater squad. By the light of their camp torch you can see there are seven of them, a spotter, the heater operator, four snipers, and a sergeant barking orders. None of them are looking your way. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Working your way through the trenches, you get ahead of the skirmishers and Alvoosh, your sapper, lays traps at a choke point while you and the others find hidden vantages that will allow you to pick off the survivors of the blasts.

A moment later the first scouts appear, creeping into the intersection and looking all around. The first and second miss Alvoosh's traps, but the third is not so lucky. A crackling eruption of electricity shoots through him, then chains to the other scouts and the troops behind. 

A quarter of them die instantly, hearts stopped by the shock. More lie twitching in the mud. The rest surge forward - and trigger a second mine, killing even more.

You wait a moment,  but neither of the other two squads seems to have yet noticed the demise of the launcher crew, so you advance to their position and take their weapons, including the launcher.

Vostiel grins at you. "Plenty of ammo left for this little darling, captain. Shall we give these dirty ambushers a taste of their own medicine?"

Unfortunately, the skirmishers have your position and change tacks to intercept, and before you get halfway there, two hulking quadrupedal shapes are bounding over the earthworks and leaping down at you. Frilled bauls!

You and Vostiel manage to cook one with your beamers before it lands on you, but the other downs one of your soldiers, mauling her with its claws and stinging her with its quills.

The skirmishers pour in right behind them, however, firing in all directions before your squad can recover. Fortunately, they're shooting in the dark, and only one of your soldiers is hit. 

After that it's all hand to hand, and there you have an advantage. Your squad have fought in the Endless Battle for years, and are expert close-in fighters. It's over in less than a minute, and you have only lost two.

There are only four of you now, and Vostiel, though he'd never admit it, is half-blind from a cut over his eye, while there are at least seven of the Chalcedon's best dug in on and around the dead construct. It would be suicide, but if you succeeded you might at least give Landi the opportunity to get the Aon Priest and the rest of the company away. 

On the other hand, maybe if you returned to the company, you could somehow avoid the heater and get everyone away.</DefaultText>

Finally, you make it into range, miraculously unscathed, and heave your last singularity detonator at the crew where it crouches by the construct's massive head. Unfortunately, a blast blinds you as you release, and the detonator bounces off the side of the construct into the rubble. The ten meter sphere of emptiness that appears as the detonator implodes makes the construct shift and drop, and the enemy crew staggers as they try to catch their balance. {SOUND: Sonic boom.}</DefaultText>

It isn't enough. The enemy spots you almost immediately, and heater blasts and beamer fire scream in all around you as you dodge and dive. 

Vostiel goes down screaming, a perfect cauterized hole through his knee, and you and the other soldiers instinctively turn back to drag him into cover. 

That's when the heater finds you, turning the ground beneath you into boiling lava, into which you fall as your feet vaporize at the ankles. You begin to burn, and there is nothing and no one to put you out.

Vostiel is caught in the ray and becomes a cloud of meat-scented steam. The other two soldiers dive to avoid it, but are cooked where they lay. Only you are left, and the beam is swinging toward you. 

With a last desperate leap, you finally get a line of sight on the operator and drill him through the heart, but the beam of the heater is still sweeping your way, and vaporises your legs and lower torso as you hit the ground.

A quarter of them die instantly, hearts shut down by the massive shock. Many more lie twitching in the mud, unable to control their limbs. The rest surge forward - and trigger the second mine, killing even more and putting more on the ground. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you shoot the survivors, a roar distracts you. A pair of dark, loping shapes are bounding for you. Frilled bauls! The skirmishers' hidden weapon!

You and Vostiel cook one with your beamers, but the other downs one of your troopers and tears her throat out before your squad can kill it. Worse, fighting it gives the other squads time to find you. The beam of the heater sweeps your way. The bright arc of an incendiary cypher drops down toward your position. 

You shout at your crew to scatter, but it's too late. The round explodes over your heads, showering liquid fire upon you. Vostiel staggers past you, his head a charred lump. You reach for him, but your hands are on fire.

Landi nods in horrified agreement. "He's right, captain. I know you're only thinking of our safety, but we'll get shanked for sure if anyone finds out about this. Don't do it."

"Keep walking."

The priest sighs, then he and the troopers walk the crate through the trenches toward the construct as you and your company watch in silence. Finally, after an excruciating interval, a sergeant from the heater crew jumps down and grabs the priest, while six skirmishers take the crate from your men. 

"ThaNK You," comes the amplified voice, as the priest and the crate are led behind the construct. "If it wASN'T FOR COwards like YOU, our jOB WOULD Be mUCH HArder. You're FREe to GO."

As your company marches once more into the endless silver rain, Landi salutes you and Vostiel gives you a nod of respect.

The monolith juts up from a low rise, a slab of silver synth four times the height of a man, with a pitted surface and sheered off top that make it look like a knife blade snapped off in someone's gut.

At first you think that's all you're up against, but then the rusted parts start to move and stand, and that's when you realize they're not parts at all. It's a working construct - a hulking metal war-mantis from a bygone era.

As it circles the monolith, you are relieved to see that the thing is limping badly, and is missing an arm and some leg plating. Unfortunately, its glowing red eyes tell you its beam weapon is still operational. Vostiel lowers his voice. "This is bad.

To your surprise, the construct still lives. It has raised itself on its arm and is scanning for targets while the troopers by the monolith do the same. 

"We can take the squad," whispers Vostiel.  "But that heavy. We're dead as soon as we attack it."

He pats the scope on his beam weapon. "If we can hit its eye, the rest is easy. But it's going to fire on the flash, so whoever pulls the trigger is dead, whether they hit or not." He looks at you. "You want me to try, captain, just say the word."

You and your last squad member, Alvoosh, stay with him as he waits for the construct to turn its eye his way. Finally, he exhales and fires, and instantly his head explodes. It almost seems as if he shot himself.

Its eye turns your way every seven heartbeats, all you have to do is aim, count, and fire. The hard part is knowing it will be the last thing you do.

As it faces you again, you exhale and pull the trigger. Your shoulder and torso instantly burn with agony as a beam stabs through you from clavicle to pelvis, cooking everything in between.

The end has come, but at least it was glorious.

      <DefaultText>"Wait," says the Aeon Priest. "This is a perfect test for my weapon. Let me use it and I can end this battle before it begins!"

Vostiel snarls at him. "And have all our own weapons blow up in our hands? I don't think so. We'll stick with the tried and true, thank you very much."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A half hour later, you approach the coordinates of the monolith and slow to a crawl, creeping up on the position on elbows and knees. 

The monolith juts up from a low rise, a slab of silver synth four times the height of a man, with a pitted surface and sheered off top that make it look like a knife blade snapped off in someone's gut. You've never known why both sides consider the thing strategically important, but reputations and commendations have been won for taking it and holding it, and that's all that matters. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ten enemy soldiers guard the monolith, four huddled in an enclosure made of rags and pitted plates of synth, and six out in the rain, patrolling in pairs. At first you think they're all you're up against, but then a pile of rusted parts stands, and you realize they're not parts at all, but an ancient war-mantis. Its limping badly, and missing an arm and some leg plating, but its glowing eyes tell you its beam weapon still works. 

Vostiel curses. "Clever bastards. They didn't just down the guardian, they fixed it up and put a leash on it. This is bad. Those eyes have the range to burn us down a league away, and they never miss. If we can't kill it immediately, we're dead."

The difficult part is getting the weapon into range without being spotted, but you manage to run it in between patrols and set it up just behind the ridge so only the muzzle is showing.

"Everyone, well back," whispers the priest as he kneels behind it.

Even you take an involuntary step back as he depresses the firing arm and sweeps the muzzle across the enemies positions on the other side of the ridge. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a long moment nothing happens, and Vostiel chuckles derisively. Then, with the roar of a hundred thunderstorms, the construct and every weapon the defenders hold explode all at once - beamers and detonators all unleashing their payloads in an orgy of death. Flames billow, electricity sizzles, and clouds of purple gas spread as the war mantis topples to one side, its red eyes dead.

Seconds later, the patrols come hunting the source of the attack, but only two. Apparently, one was in range of the priest's weapon and blew up with the rest. 

Your squad picks them off with ease and the monolith is yours. The battle, as the Aeon Priest had promised, is over before it could begin.

Two of the three pairs are blown to pieces, and you pick off the third with ease, then approach the ridge again to deal with team in the gun emplacement. 

But as you poke your head up to reconnoiter, you see that the construct has raised itself up on its one arm, and is craning its neck around, looking for targets, while the soldiers in the enclosure are doing the same. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The enemy patrols converge on your position, and quickly discover the traps you left behind. Two are melted to slag, and you pick off the third with ease, then return to the ridge. To your surprise, the construct still lives. It has raised itself on its arm and is scanning for targets while the troopers by the monolith do the same. 

"We can take the squad," whispers Vostiel. "But that heavy. We're dead as soon as we attack it."

He pats the scope of his beam weapon. "If we can snipe its eye, the rest is easy. But it's going to fire on the flash, so whoever pulls the trigger is dead, whether they hit or not." He looks at you. "You want me to try, captain, just say the word."

He turns and lays himself behind the ridge so his head is level with it, then pokes the barrel of his beamer through the weeds that cover it. You and your last squad member, Alvoosh, stay with him as he waits for the construct to turn its eye his way. Finally, he exhales and fires, and instantly his head explodes. It almost seems as if he shot himself.

You look up. The construct is flat on its face, smoke and sparks coming from its shattered head, while the soldiers in the enclosure next to it are firing in all the wrong directions. {SOUND: Robot's powerful beam weapon.}</DefaultText>

Behind you, the Aeon Priest edges out of hiding and stares at Vostiel's corpse. "Was it worth it, captain. I don't doubt you'll get glory for it, and a promotion too, most likely. But was it really worth it?"

You wave him off and lay behind the ridge, then poke the beamer through the weeds and watch the construct scanning back and forth. It's a machine. Its cycle is predictable. Its eye turns your way every seven heartbeats, all you have to do is aim, count, and fire. The hard part is knowing it will be the last thing you do.

As it faces you again, you exhale and pull the trigger. Your shoulder and torso instantly burn with agony as a beam stabs through you from clavicle to pelvis, cooking everything in between.

"Captain!" shouts Vostiel. He turns you over. "Moon of Fortune, he's alive! You got it, captain. The big bastard is dead! You got it!" {SOUND: Robot's powerful beam weapon.}</DefaultText>

The last thing you hear, as the silver rain beats down on your upturned face and consciousness begins to leave you, is the voice of the priest. "You'd be alive if you'd let me use my weapon. Guess you'd rather be a dead hero, damned fool."

Unfortunately, it *is* fast enough to get off one more shot before the cypher's implosion collapses it and everything around it into a single point. A searing beam stabs through you from clavicle to pelvis, cooking everything in between.

It pauses on the ridge top, examining the dead patrols, then starts limping forward, its head swiveling back and forth, looking for movement. It's only a matter of time before it finds you all. Staying still is not an option. You must make a move.

They spread out behind a low ridge so the construct will have a harder time killing them all at once, then trap the approaches to their positions in preparation for any counterattack.

Finally, you're within throwing range, and as it comes into view once more, you key your aether-com to signal the squad. At the click, they start firing from behind the ridge, drawing the eyes of the construct and the troopers in the enclosure. Now's your chance!
