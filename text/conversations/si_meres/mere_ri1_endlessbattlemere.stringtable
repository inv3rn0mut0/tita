      <DefaultText>"As you can see, we have troubles of our own," Lovac says, getting back to his feet. "The Changing God's latest ploy has paralyzed the Reconciler of Truth. Of course, Heaven's Rejoinder remains functioning, which means *we* cannot reverse their successes while *they* can reverse ours."

He leads you to a strategy table showing a three-dimensional projection of a battlefield across parallel realities. He swipes through several images. All of them show your army on the verge of defeat. 

He shakes his head. "We are in more danger now of losing this war than since the First died. I'm afraid I must send you out again, Bericael. We must save the Reconciler."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Excellent," says Lovac, and turns to his advisers - all castoffs, you notice. "Friends, what are your suggestions? How do we undo what has been done to the Reconciler... without *using* the Reconciler?"

A scarred female castoff in red armor speaks up. "I recommend an all-out assault on the position of Heaven's Rejoinder. This will of course fail, but it will give cover for Bericael to slip through the paths of the White Nests and reach the Rejoinder from behind. There, she can reset it... then destroy it."

She pounds the table. "Then *we* will be the only side who can change history!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As your consciousness coalesces, you find yourself in an underground bunker which is shaking from an attack far above. You stand mid-salute in front a castoff encased in an articulated metal carapace. He's so skeletal you doubt he could move without it. You remember his name is Lovac, Paj Rekken's second-in-command in the Endless Battle. Three advisers sit behind him.

Lovac shakes his synth-encased head and addresses you. "Don't worry about the message, Bericael. It's been rendered moot. We're just lucky Commander Rekken made it out of Miel Avest alive. She missed the destruction of the sanctuary by moments."

A thunderous explosion rocks the bunker, sending everyone staggering.

      <DefaultText>Lovac laughs. "Again, eh? I suppose one of the hazards of dancing so often through realities and times is that it plays hell with memory. Not to worry. I'll explain it once more."

"Centuries ago, when the First still lived, she found the Reconciler, a machine of the ancients which allowed the user to look at multiple versions of a recent event and lock reality onto the one they liked best - making it the *only* reality. With it she began choosing realities in which we had won more battles than we had lost, and quickly drove the Changing God to the brink of defeat. Until, that is, he acquired his own machine, Heaven's Rejoinder, which can undo the Reconciler's realities and make its own."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A male mutant, exquisitely beautiful except for the second mouth in his throat, speaks in melodious harmony. "I suggest Bericael use the reality storm that ravages no-man's land to find the Reconciler's saboteur. If she can navigate the shifting shards, she can stop the saboteur before he reaches it."

He shrugs. "This will only return us to the status quo, of course, but it will be easier for Bericael to deal with one man than the deadly White Nests."

"Any other suggestions?" asks Lovac. When there is no answer, he turns to you. "I approve of either path. As it is you who will face these challenges, I leave it to you which you will choose. What do you say?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lovac nods, then looks at the others. "Any objections to Bericael's choice?"

The castoff with two mouths shrugs. "If she is brave enough to face the moths, then we are brave enough to commit our troops."

"And with luck," says the castoff in red armor. "When she has successfully reset the Rejoinder, the battle will not have happened at all, and our troops will be safe."

"Very well," says Lovac, standing. "Then make your preparations. When you are ready, we will begin."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You thank Lovac then walk toward the storm of shards, holding the saboteur's gloves in one hand. Strange as it seems, the scheme seems to be working. Some of the shards do not have the right smell at all, and you are able to discount them entirely. Some are harder to decide upon, but eventually, you are able to narrow it down to three - a moonlit lake, a canyon full of glancing sun and flitting shapes, and a storm of swirling chaos. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hello, sunshine. You must be Bericael. I'm Hugo Igratch. The Nests are just through here, but before we go in, let me tell you what we're up against."

He unrolls a hand-drawn map. "The tunnels are mined at every intersection, sometimes with detonation cyphers, sometimes plain, old explosives. My dogs here can eat energy blasts, but they'll die on regular mines like we will, so it's best to check what we're walking into. Trouble is, the longer we're in there the more likely the moths are going to find us, so if we take too many wrong turns, we're in trouble. You do not want to fight Stratharian war moths, trust me, so no shilly-shallying."

He hands you the map. "Right. In we go."

      <DefaultText>The cave narrows as you enter it, then widens again at a stone wall with a man-high crack in it. Igratch lets his dogs go through it first, then turns sideways and edges through after them. You do the same and find yourself in L-shaped tunnel covered in moth silk and bones. The stench of the place makes your eyes water. 

Pointing to the map, your guide shows you that you are in the southeast corner of the tunnels, which lead away into darkness to the west and the north. 

"Which way, sister?" asks Igratch.

      <DefaultText>You are floating in a dark lake next to a large, square raft. On it, kneeling in perfect rows, are a hundred women, all bald, all with strange, brass devices on their backs, and all praying. In unison they press their foreheads to the planks and their devices open. A vapor rises from them, then combines into a twisting white column which snakes toward the far side of the lake. 

Looking in that direction, you see another raft, crowded with praying monks, also emitting a snaking vapor. 

In the middle of this strange conflict the reality storm stirs the waters. You swim for it, but only the shard you left matches the scent of the gloves.  You step back into the reality you know and face your choices again. </DefaultText>

The fliers slash at each other with long razored poles, trying to tear fabric and flesh, and every now and then a wing goes spiraling down into the canyon. 

You see the shard storm swirling on a mesa in the middle of the canyon and race for the bridge that leads to it. Three shards feel promising - a dense forest at night, rolling farmland in the setting sun, and a muddy battlefield in the rain. </DefaultText>

They are also not interested in you, though they bump into you constantly. Instead they are battling each other, circling and swooping at impossible speeds.

It is a vicious battle and it appears it has been going on for some time. You are knee deep in tiny carcasses.

Ahead of you, the insects buzz in and out of the drifting shards of the reality storm. You hurry to it, but find only one matches the scent of the gloves - the one you just came from. You step back into the reality you know and face your choices again. </DefaultText>

Both sides are armed with swords and spears, and both have holy men who cast spells of fire and darkness at each other, but their colors are switched - the golden warriors fight under the banner of the Changing God, the blue under that of the First.

Through the trees you see the shifting shards of the reality storm and you edge around the battle to them,  but only one matches the scent of the gloves - the one you just came from. You step back onto the lip of the sunlit canyon and face your choices again. </DefaultText>

Children play on them, fighting with sticks and calling each other Chalcedon and Rekken. 

On a hillside, walled off and untilled, the shards of the reality storm still twist and mingle. You make your way to them by hedgerowed lanes, but only one matches the scent of the gloves - the one you just came from.

All around this scene, the Chalcedon's soldiers are leading away Paj's surviving troops, both castoff and human. There aren't many left. Most are dead on the field and being picked over by murden corpse thieves. Beyond them, you can just see the reality storm's shifting ripples.  

You hurry through the rain toward them, and as you get close, three of them seem better than the others - a glimmering swamp, a plain of giant bonfires, and a frantic battle.</DefaultText>

You circle it, and find, crouching by the far side of it, a wiry man in dark armor, focused on cutting through its metal skin. You recognize him as Zerronth, one of the Chalcedon's wiliest operatives, whom Bericael has tangled with more than once. 

As you creep up on him, he whips around, alarmed. He throws his hands in front of him pleading. "Brunna!" he gasps. "Wait. Hear me out! I have information you need to know."

A thunderous explosion rocks the bunker and sends you both staggering sideways. At a table behind Lovac, three of his advisors are thrown from their chairs. Lovac recovers and looks at the ceiling. "But as you can see, we're having troubles of our own.

"And it seems as if the Chalcedon, the Changing God's general, may have found his advantage at last.

      <DefaultText>"The White Nests," says Lovac. "Are the catacombs where the Chalcedon breeds his Stratharian war moths. A horrible place. I don't know what the tunnels were originally used for, but now they are a tangled mess of webs and larvae. It's filled with traps, since the enemy knows the tunnels are a vulnerable approach, but the real danger is the moths themselves - horrible creatures whose phosphorescent glow withers the flesh and maddens the mind."

He shivers. "Once they sense your presence, they will not rest until you are dead. It won't be an easy approach, by any means."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lovac shakes his head. "We and the Changing God have used the Reconciler of Truth and Heaven's Rejoinder so often, and at such cross purposes, that there are places in the no-man's-land between our front lines where no single reality holds sway. Fractured ripples of possibility drift across the field like squalls of rain, changing all in their path and offering entry into other times and versions of the present. And of course, once one enters a different version of reality, then all the shards one encounters in that reality are different too."

He pales. "It's the less deadly route, but it's still possible to be lost forever in such a maze."</DefaultText>

He places a hand on your shoulder. "You and the saboteur are alike, you share a common desire for justice and the greater good. *Use* that. Listen to your body, to the Tides, and you should be able to determine the saboteur's path." He shrugs. "Or at least narrow down the possibilities."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two days, two marches, and three minor skirmishes later, you and Lovac's army are fifty kilometers inside the Changing God's territory, and the battle is joined. It is immense. Entire battalions of troops march into the storm of smoke and terrifying energies that envelopes the battlefield. Harnessed cragworms carry squads of skirmishers forward on their segmented backs. Dread destroyers and other war constructs launch thousands of detonation devices toward the horizon as they advance. The ground shakes with constant explosions.</DefaultText>

You enter the ravine and it leads you away from the fighting, getting deeper as it goes. Finally, at a point so narrow the walls almost shut out the sky, a man leading two leashed Ergovore Hounds steps out of a cave and cracks a smile.

The skinny, small man has dark brown eyes that look friendly. They seem to sit in bottomless sockets, an impression encouraged by his prominent nose and wide smile.

"I approve," says the castoff with two mouths. "It can be done quickly, and the risk is low."

"And if Bericael is lost," says the castoff in red armor. "We can try the assault I suggested with someone else running through the White Nests."

"Very well," says Lovac, standing. "Bericael, these are the gloves of the saboteur. You'll use these - their scent and their Tides - to navigate the shards and find your man."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Under heavy guard, and with force shields and temporal randomizers in place, Lovac escorts you to the edge of No Man's Land. It is scarred with trenches and thick with roiling smoke, but more unnerving are the drifting shards of time and reality that cross it like summer storms. In one, great armies move. In another, towering constructs with glowing eyes burn the homes of fleeing villagers. And on and on. 

Lovac points ahead. "There - somewhere - is your path. Use your instincts to hunt this villain down, but take care. Too many jumps and you will enter realities where the storm is fading, the shards closing. You could be trapped in a distant reality with no way back."

      <DefaultText>You walk toward the storm of shards, holding the saboteur's gloves in one hand. Strange as it seems, the scheme seems to be working. Some of the shards do not have the right smell at all, and you are able to discount them entirely. Some are harder to decide upon, but eventually - perhaps because you find you have a strange sense of kinship with this lone operative who danced through these dimensions before you - you are able to narrow it down to two - a moonlit lake and a canyon full of glancing sun and flitting shapes.</DefaultText>

The fliers slash at each other with long razored poles, trying to tear fabric and flesh, and every now and then a wing goes spiraling down into the canyon. 

You see the shard storm swirling on a mesa in the middle of the canyon and race for the bridge that leads to it. Two shards look promising - a muddy battlefield in the rain and rolling farmland glowing in the setting sun.</DefaultText>

All around this scene, the Chalcedon's soldiers are leading away Paj's surviving troops, both castoff and human. There aren't many left. Most are dead on the field and being picked over by murden corpse-thieves. Beyond them, you can just see the reality storm's shifting ripples.  

You hurry through the rain toward them, and as you get close, two of them seem better than the others - a glimmering swamp and a frantic battle.</DefaultText>

For as far as the eye can see, the field is covered in corpses, burned to sticks inside their uniforms. There are no living troops at all. The only movement is the roiling smoke that rises from the broken hulks of shattered war machines. 

Paj chokes to see it all. "Is this what victory looks like?" She asks, then hangs her head. "What have we done? What have we done?"</DefaultText>

The guards at the nearest orifice tell you the way to the Memovira's fortress, and after entering and traveling though the Bloom's viscera and ventricles you reach her gates.

A dozen hidden guards step into view and fire at you with sonic bludgeons that knock you to the floor and pummel your brain. The last thing you hear as Bericael loses consciousness and you are wrenched back into your own body, is Paj whispering in your ear as she holds you.

Paj groans. "And I'm to take this message to the survivors? That they should let the monster which killed us walk free, hoping it might strike our enemy first? Why don't you tell them, sister? Why not reveal yourself at last?"

The door slides open and the Memovira enters. "It isn't time. I-" She cuts off as she sees you. "Who is this?"

He looks you in the eye. "I know you to be an honorable opponent, but the hidden hand that pulls your strings, and those of Paj and Lovac, is uncaring and corrupt. Beware your leader, Bericael."

      <DefaultText>Paj enters the room behind her, then groans. "Bericael. Naturally. Well, Maralel, your secret's out now, like it or not. Unless you plan to kill the blade you specifically asked me to send for."

The Memovira shakes her head. "No more deaths. Not on our side, at least."

"Then, Bericael," says Paj. "May I present the First, our leader, back from the dead to kill us all."

"Enough, Paj!" snaps the First, then looks you over. "I asked Commander Rekken to bring me her best, for in the coming days I will have need of an agent who will act without flinching, no matter what the order. Is that you, Bericael Brunna? Are you ready to do *anything* to stop the Changing God?"</DefaultText>

With a bow, you leave the bunker and find the xi-drake roost. There you mount the drake the grooms have saddled for you and fly toward Sagus Cliffs. When you reach it, you bank toward its base and the land near the living mountain of flesh that is the Bloom. 

The guards at the nearest orifice tell you Paj Rekken is with the Memovira, and after entering and traveling though the Bloom's canals you reach her fortress. Her guards admit you without a word, and you are ushered into a antechamber and told to wait. From behind a door you hear the voice of Paj Rekken - raised in anger. </DefaultText>

"It was worth the risk," says the First.

Paj buries her face in her hands. "Perhaps but..." She looks up again. "But you could have told me! You could have let me warn Aadiriis, others loyal to us. You-"

"I could not," says the First. "Anyone you warned might have warned the child. It was impossible."

"Then you could have ordered me to bring Aadiriis here!" shouts Paj. "I didn't have to know why. Any pretense would have done. Instead you allowed Aadiriis-"

Igratch lets his dogs go through it first, then turns sideways and edges through after them. You do the same and find yourself in L-shaped tunnel covered in moth silk and bones. The stench of the place makes your eyes water. 

Pointing to the map, your guide shows you that you are in the southeast corner of the tunnels, which lead away into darkness to the west and the north. 

"Which way, sister?" asks Igratch.

      <DefaultText>This room is a towering, echoey space, with vaulted ceilings almost lost in the darkness above you. Grave markers rise like game pieces on a checkered floor. All are webbed in moth silk. There are exits on all four walls - north, west, east, and south.

You know there is a trap hidden among the graves, but without testing, you can't tell what kind. 
{Room 6. Bomb. Exits are North, West, East, South. Untested.}

      <DefaultText>Glistening man-sized chrysalises hang from the low ceiling of this room and sway gently to and fro, though there is no breeze.  

Beyond the chrysalises you can see that the room has exits to the north, west, and south. You cannot, however, see the trap that you know is there. Only testing will determine which kind it is.

      <DefaultText>This room glows green with the light of phosphorescent mushrooms. They grow on everything - the floor, the rocks that have tumbled from the ceiling, and the bodies of the soldiers that lie pressed up against the walls as if thrown there. They also grow in the open archways that lead from the room - north, west, and south. 

Somewhere, hidden among the mushrooms is a trap, but you can't tell what kind without testing.

The only movement is the roiling smoke that rises from the broken hulks of shattered war machines.
