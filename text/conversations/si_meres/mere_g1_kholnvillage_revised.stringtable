You're kneeling in the dust, pinning Matkina to the ground by her wrists. Half her face is drenched in blood. Around you, Kholn Village burns.</DefaultText>

"Me bastard," Tash agrees, in that voice that is not your voice. And he *pulls* at something inside her and she screams. Layer by layer he peels her mind, removing pieces of consciousness and identity.

Behind, men and animals fight in the burning village. Dying shrieks mingle with a deep, unearthly howl that makes your spine tremble. Focused on his work, Tash does not turn.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina's head lolls to one side, jaw slack. Her eyes go dull.

The gravel crunches as someone approaches from behind. "Finished, Gerave?" Paj Rakken's voice, the Militia's strike commander.

Tash stands, leaving her twitching in the dust. "Yes, Commander. Not my best work. I prefer to slice rather than rip. Still, she won't remember anything about the Jahk or this incident."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good. Haul her a ways into the desert and leave her." She glances around. "All that effort she made to save this place, wasted."

Rakken sighs. "Remarkable beasts, to be sure. I can see why the First was so intent on having them." Her voice has just a tinge of regret, you think, but the memory begins to break apart like a dream before you're able to make out Tash's reply.

You find yourself staring once again at Neng and another Matkina.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Jahk?" Tash asks, staring down at a sketch amid the maps scattered over the table. "It looks like a horn."

"The desert is full of teratomorphs," Rakken says, "We believe this item will make them docile enough to move the main body of our forces through without incident. The First has some other ideas for it as well."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A hook in your spine, like the Merecaster buried a harpoon inside you. For a moment there's nothing but darkness, and the sense of being pulled into a void within yourself.

When your vision clears, you are somewhere else. Some *one* else.

You stand next to a woman, a younger version of Matkina. She looks very different from the one in Sagus Cliffs, without the ugly scar and haunted eyes. You're both dressed in soldier's uniforms, talking to an old man in a village square at night.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Neng," she says. "Tash is my superior, a Gerave in the First's Militia. You can trust him, he risked a lot coming here when he knew I was going to warn you. They're going to attack the village."

The old man's eyes are blind and white. "The Sand Knights? When?"

"No, the Militia! They've planned an assault on Kholn Village, but I don't know when. She glances up at you. "Do you know, sir?"</DefaultText>

She looks up at you and bites her lip. "Neng, listen. There's no time. The First's Militia is about to attack the town."

Neng's white eyes get as big and round as the moon. "Attack us? What for?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They want something called a Jahk. We're supposed to get it. That's my 'mission' here."

Memory surfaces at the word *Jahk.*  Tash, sweating in the desert heat despite the shade of a tent canopy. He's talking to the same uniformed woman as earlier.

"Find the Jahk if you can, but your real mission is to watch Matkina. The First believes her affection for Kholn Village outweighs her loyalty to us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We don't know exactly, but soon. Within the next day or two. You can estimate that much based on the orders coming down."

All this talk of attacks makes the quiet night feel strange, as if there should be sounds of battle. As Matkina and Neng talk, the imagined sounds become louder, more real, and then they are real, more real than the conversation, and the quiet night is very loud day.

Your ears fill with the clash and boom of combat. Another sound, too, a horrid skin-crawling howl, like some unnatural beast.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stench of fire and blood brings tears to Tash's eyes. He kneels on top of Matkina, pinning her as she struggles and spits. "You bastard!"

"Me bastard," he agrees, holding her wrists with one hand. "I don't dislike you, Matkina, but I have to hurt you now. Orders. I'll be as careful as I can, but the conditions aren't great, so here and there I might have to rip instead of slice. Bear with me."

And he *pulls* at something in her mind, and Matkina screams and screams as he peels her apart.

And then it's quiet again, and Matkina is here, not screaming but talking earnestly with Neng.</DefaultText>

"I know," Matkina interrupts. "*I* know. But this isn't a bandit gang, or Sand Knights. The First's Militia is an *army.* You're better off evacuating." She glances at you, as if seeking affirmation, but Neng speaks before you can.

"You are right, Kina, the safest route is evacuation." He pauses.

      <DefaultText>Everyone looks at you, surprised.

"A horn like a... like... a *horn?*" Matkina asks, putting a hand on either side of her head, fingers poking up.  You realize, suddenly, that she has all her fingers.

"More or less," a new voice growls, and a grizzled-looking man in gray middle age emerges from the darkness. "Made of synth, but it resembles an animal's horn carved into a musical instrument."

Matkina puts her finger-horns away with an irritated glare. "Lish."</DefaultText>

"Don't!" Neng barks. Matkina stops in her tracks, staring furiously at the newcomer. "Lish, it's the middle of the night. Why are you wandering around?"

"Looking for Tik," the other man replies with a shrug. "Thought I heard little Kina's voice talking about a militia coming to annihilate the village. Said to myself, 'that ain't possible, Lish, Kina knows never to come back to Kholn.' Figured I'd better look into the situation."</DefaultText>

"We're not threatening you, idiot, we came to *warn* you!" Matkina cries.

"Says you. Sounded threatening from my end, you being part of the army that's coming to kill us and all."

Neng puts his arm between Matkina and Lish. "I don't care if it is a threat, Lish, though you know perfectly well it's not. You described the Jahk. Do you have it? What is it?"

Lish shakes his head. "I've heard of it is all. Like I said, it's a horn. An instrument."</DefaultText>

Incomprehensible illustrations flow across most of its surface. It has a primitive style, giving the seal an ancient look, but there's no sign of weathering on the synth, and the vivid art stand out as if painted yesterday.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At the word *Jahk,* a memory suddenly surfaces. Not one of yours, but some remnant of Tash:

The Militia commander, Paj Rakken, is briefing you and Matkina. "Since she lived in Kholn Village, I want you two as advance scouts. Find the instrument, bring it back here, and maybe we won't have to raze the place to the ground searching."

The memory leaves you as abruptly as it came.

The falls plunge into a pond within walking distance of the village. A narrow road goes off into the desert, connecting the remote outpost with the rest of the world.</DefaultText>

A middle-aged man with a grouchy, unkempt look and three days of gray stubble is wandering between the stalls, shouting "TIK!" at the top of his lungs. 

"That's Lish," Matkina murmurs to you with distaste.

When he sees you, he stops his shouting and eyes you coldly. "Stranger. And Matkina. Never expected to *see* you again." He smirks as if this were funny.

She stiffens beside you, and you feel waves of fury radiating off her. "Lish," she says, through gritted teeth.</DefaultText>

A little girl steps forward, her dusty face streaked, as if she's been crying. "He's prolly at headquarters. That's the old cave up by the falls."

      <DefaultText>The search doesn't take long. Most of what the children leave is either discarded or meant to stay outdoors. Ketta's missing animal is a work of art: painstakingly stitched from soft leather and expensive cloth.

Whoever made it for her has a great deal of skill. What's unclear is why they'd waste it on such a hideous creature. Mr. Snake appears to be composed mostly of plush tentacles and bleached-leather teeth. Ketta might find it adorable, but it would give nightmares to most children.

This is a danger they understand - an enemy they know from painful experience. No matter how bloodthirsty the First's Militia may be, to the people of Kholn Village it is a vague and faceless enemy. They know the Sand Knights all too well.

      <DefaultText>"I can't let you seach the village, but maybe it's not *in* the village. Kina, do you remember the painted seal up by the falls, where the children play? We've never gotten it open. There are old ruins on the outskirts as well. And you should check with Lish."

The blind eyes stare just past you. "I will go raise the alarm. Thank you, stranger. Tash. We will speak again, I hope."

Neng walks away swiftly, confidently, despite his blindness. A bell begins to ring moments later.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You've passed it several times without much thought: a derelict building long abandoned. Like everything here, it's built of gray bedrock from the cliff.

It looks like a cragworm used it for a couch. Half is unrecognizable rubble, and the rest looks dangerously unstable.

"Sand Knights," Matkina says, poking through the ruins. "The house was too close to the desert floor, easy to hit with artillery. The newer ones are up on the higher levels. Tik has a pretty good little hiding place."</DefaultText>

The other Tash visited the same merchant, bought the same knife, for the same fifteen shins, just stalling for time until Rakken's team was in position to arrest Matkina.

He called it a souvenir of Kholn Village. Hours later he used it to give Matkina a souvenir of her own: this is the knife that slashed her face apart and left the scar you remember so vividly from Sagus Cliffs.</DefaultText>
