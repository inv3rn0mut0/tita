      <DefaultText>Blue. Once, you had two dozen words for all its hues and shades; metaphors to glaives' capes and courtesans' eyes. Now, the sky is just... blue. The ground is stone. The man before you, fat. Now, all is vague and drab, like...{VOICE: : At "like..." the narrator (or anyway the POV MPC) is groping for a metaphor and can't find one.}
 
The Memorialist sees you've stopped, and he halts as well. "Let's have a rest, then," he says, passing you a bottle of fortified water as he catches his breath. You knew a word for that, too, this drink they brew in the Valley of Dead Heroes. Gone. "We aren't far from his cenotaph." The fat man wipes his brow. {VOICE: "Gone" should be a powerful blow with a longer than usual pause after the period.}

Deep in your pocket, your hand feels for the round tin that holds the worms; your fingers clutch it tight and as they do, they brush a piece of paper. {VOICE: "The worms" should be delivered ominously, faintly disgustedly. The worms are the MPC's addiction; he craves and loathes them}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you his shadow?" the Memorialist asks abruptly. "Kalaghat Anvor, I mean. The one you came to see."

Without waiting for a response, he barrels onward. "We thought he'd cast his shadows among his own kind. We reasoned that with the Tabaht gone, his line was lost forever."

He stops and flushes more deeply, then, hastily, with a sign, adds, "But shadows fall where they will, as they will." {VOICE: "But shadows fall . . . as they will." This is a kind of catechism-type line, delivered by rote and note entirely believingly. Note that line has a deliberate staccato structure designed to run slightly at odds with the "hastily" - it emphasizes how the Memorialist is a bit thrown off, nervous, jangled.}

Kalaghat Anvor. Tabaht. Shadows. They flit around the edges of your mind, escaping your grasp. But the worms... they are well within reach. {VOICE: Now when the narrator says "worms" the disgust is largely gone: I hear this almost a little huskily, anticipating their pleasure. However, the "they are well within reach" could have a more ominous sound.}

"Shall we continue, pilgrim?" the Memorialist asks, to break the silence. "One more short hike will do it."

Your body is ready. Your mind is not. {VOICE: Similarly, I would add some dread to "your mind is not."}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You slip the crisp, neatly folded sheet from your pocket and carefully open it.

"I will want the worms, but I will be strong. I will wonder what I have lost, but they will only rob me further. I will endure, and I will build the tower of my intellect anew. Kalaghat Anvor will furnish the material. The Mindlink, not the worms, will be my tool."

The Mindlink.

A dead-eyed trader from Haref sold it for the last of your once-great heap of prizes and bounties. Now it's slung from your belt, a hideous mask with a synth tube hanging off it like some sathoshi tentacle.

Inside is a clump of bristly worms, blind and thin, barely moving. Your fingers itch and tremble. Your nostrils flare. You no longer know their name, but you know exactly how to use them.

Careful not to spill the precious contents, you close the tin and slide it back into your pocket.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Memorialist regards you skeptically, as if he expects to be the butt of a joke. As he looks in your eyes, however, he softens.

"We live in a world of darkness, pilgrim, and each of us is just a shadow of one of the great heroes buried here in this valley. But there's a light that shines behind the world. To know it, we shadows must measure ourselves against the heroes who cast us, and thus learn the light that lives beyond."

He takes a swig from the canteen. "I thought you set out on this pilgrimage to visit the tomb of Kalaghat Anvor because you were his shadow. That you wanted to stand before him and find enlightenment. Am I wrong? Are you his shadow or not?"</DefaultText>

But I've also seen a novice stumble across her hero by mere chance. If you find Kalaghat Anvor, you will know who you are, or are not."

He gestures to the hilltop toward which you've been hiking. "Just over that rise is the monument. As for his tomb... you said that the cenotaph would lead the way. I can't see how, but for the famous puzzle-breaker of Sagus Cliffs, I'm sure it will be simple."

      <DefaultText>Gripping a grub between two fingers, you slip it into your nostril and breathe as deeply as you can. The worm works with you, eager to reach its meal.

You feel it squirm the last stretch, and then pain like a knife stabs your brain, and you know the worm is feeding, eating gray matter and pissing neurostimulants, letting your mind reconquer the vast territories it has lost.

Mnemotodes. That's what they're called, not worms. And cerulean. That's the sky's color. Not blue. The rush of understanding overwhelms you: you read the world's unwritten words, devise stratagems, unravel mysteries...

      <DefaultText>As you follow the Memorialist up the crumbling path, he carries on about a time when all the roads in the valley were as well-paved as the streets of Sagus Cliffs. Then, reaching the hillcrest, he falls into reverential silence.

When you catch up, you see the sight that awed him even for the thousandth time: a clutch of exquisite monuments, ranging from vast to miniature, from abstract to eerily lifelike. The Memorialist points to one of them - a many-sided slab of black stone - and gestures for you to follow.

This must be the cenotaph of Kalaghat Anvor, Tabaht general and would-be world conqueror.

      <DefaultText>Up close, the cenotaph is not so remarkable. Its faces are adorned with gruesome, stylized reliefs depicting the Tabaht and their dragolith mounts trampling the corpses of their foes. Neat, geometric glyphs encircle the panels. Like the images themselves, they are embossed rather than engraved.

The Memorialist clears his throat. "Of course, Kalaghat Anvor isn't *here*. Like the other heroes, his body's in one of the cells in the catacombs beneath us." He nods at the monument. "This is its own sort of shadow - all memorials are."

As your guide mumbles something about the difference between expression, impression, and reality, your attention returns to the cenotaph itself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>What seemed at first individual glyphs are far more complex: smaller symbols assembled into larger patterns, linked into chains, twined and twisted into knots. Never a tangle or ramble: it is more mathematical or scientific notation than language.

Running your fingers across the glyphs, you see that they shine briefly under your touch, then fade.

Perhaps there is a formula here to be solved, a structure, a higher, hidden order to be found. Perhaps here you could catch glimmers of the Tabaht's military mastery. But the sieve of your mind holds nothing, and any secrets slip right through.</DefaultText>

He picks out others and shows how the ideogram for "soldier" weaves into "warband," which can in turn mesh into "column" or "army."

Excitement grows in his voice as he leads you to another panel and shows you the unique markings that compose the pattern for "Underspine." "A high council, we think, or god."

He notes what seems to be a structure to the writing - a pattern within the pattern. "Could it be a puzzle to open the way to Kalaghat Anvor?" he asks, expectantly.

      <DefaultText>Perhaps your guide underestimates the strength still coiled in your sinews; perhaps he imagines your body has gone soft as your mind. Or maybe his faith gives him no cause to fear leaving this world of shadows.

Whatever the case, he hardly seems to flinch as you swing a jagged rock toward his head. The sound is more a thud than a crack, but any fool could see his skull is smashed.

You drag his body to the basin and saw at his neck until the blood begins to run, filling the bowl faster than its narrow drain can empty.

You step back and watch as the glyphs glow bright blue, casting with their light a kind of shimmering portal in the air. Through it, you see hints of a room.

Inside is a mound of worm-like grubs, blind and thin, barely moving. You fingers itch and tremble. Your nostrils flare. You no longer know their name, but you know exactly how to use them.

Careful not to spill the precious contents, you close the tin and slide it back into your pocket.</DefaultText>

The Mindlink.

A dead-eyed trader sold it for the last of your once-great heap of prizes and bounties. Now it's slung from your belt, a hideous mask with a synth tube hanging off it like some sathoshi tentacle.

      <DefaultText>A few twists of the coffin's cylindrical locks, and the lid rises up with a hiss of icy, age-old air. As the mist clears, you see at last the face of Kalaghat Anvor.

You feel nothing at the sight of him, never having known the terror of his triumvirate. His inhuman features are slightly mummified, but well preserved; his ebon tabard is faded with time that even the sarcophagus could not keep at bay.

But it is his head that matters, not his clothes. His head, and its brain, and the insight sheathed within, an edge keen enough to cut through the tangle of your own failures.

Suddenly, the darkness explodes with light: the nebulous, patchwork glow of your own mind and, beyond it, the glorious mandala formed by the thoughts of Kalaghat Anvor.

A mote emerges from that pattern, and a confused voice whispers, "You are not the Underspine."

Almost instantly, the geometry of his mind transforms into a star fortress from whose bastions dagger-like shapes stream forth. {[A] SOUND: Heavy breathing in a mask.}</DefaultText>

You confound Anvor's vanguard with a flurry of bright weavings, while stabbing your own lines of thought deep into the perfect geometry of his mind. In the end, that is all it takes: his thoughts destroy themselves, unraveling even as they seek to mend the breaches you have cut. Bit by bit, order turns to chaos, and the great light of Kalaghat Anvor to a mere shadow.

As he fades, you slip free of the Mindlink, and - moments later - of the Tabaht's tomb.

His thoughts flee from your mind, and seem to curl in upon themselves in a flurry of self-destruction. Moments later, there is nothing but darkness, and you have no choice but to draw the Mindlink from your head.

The bier is decorated with familiar glyphs: you recognize "war" and "death" and "purity" among them. But these designs hold little interest: they are just catchwords, and they will teach you nothing of the Tabaht genius.

The coffin, for its part, is a single hunk of milky aquamarine. Its lid is less opaque, and through it you can see the corpse's silhouette. Most importantly, you notice a simple locking mechanism holding the two together; opening the sarcophagus would be a straightforward matter.</DefaultText>

"The weak-willed and degenerate always dream that the great prevail by 'tricks' or cheats or chance." His thoughts array themselves in interlinked chains of blue and black. "But war disabuses tricksters of their vanity. Failure falls upon those proved false by battle, and victory is the stamp of truth."

The chains stretch and run throughout the patterns of his mind. "We did not master deceit or even war; we mastered our own authentic selves. We triumphed by philosophy, not strategy."

"In all systems, the variable is subordinate to the constant. The measure of things must be fixed." Lines of thought stab out from the unfolded eidolon, probing your mind like outriders. "You do not comprehend."

The eidolon rearranges itself into a pyramid. "When one stands at the utmost peak of the highest mountain, an advance is no better than a retreat: all change is decline." Again he probes, and again you are found wanting.

"To not fall, one must say, 'There is no more ascent. Here I stay.' Many have so spoken, but the Tabaht alone spoke truly, resisting the vanity of progress."

We alone held to our truth with unflinching conviction."

The sphere stretches into a toroid. "Words. Faith. Art. All was held pure and unchanging within the Underspine - a perfect, eternal purpose spanning all generations. What can stand before such united trust?"

You see the city of Sagus Cliffs, rising above the plains like a beacon, a treasure, a false icon to be smashed to pieces.

      <DefaultText>Death has not dulled the Tabaht's weapons or his will. But the mind is more than a mere battlefield, and riddled and rotten as yours may be, it is not yet bereft of all its old gifts.

Lines of thought race between you, and great jagged rifts are torn in the fabric of your minds. Defenses tighten, feints fly, and wills pound against each other in brute desire.

Plainly, there can be no end to this but the destruction of you both.

You pull the Mindlink off and, without a backward glance for the Tabaht corpse, stagger forth from the tomb.

      <DefaultText>As you tell the Tabaht general of his kind's demise, the geometric perfection of his thoughts fractures for a moment - not quite into chaos or organic shapes, but into sharp shards that cannot quite reform. Some of these needles jab into your own mind, probing, confirming that you tell the truth.

"I see," Anvor answers.

Eventually, the fragments of his mind reform, though the ranks of its guardians seem thinned. "At least they are safe from the corruption of change. To be frozen forever in cold death is a better fate than the seamy, teeming welter of your city."

On one side of the cenotaph, there's something else: an obscene picture, crudely etched rather than raised, its edges scorched black. The Memorialist clears his throat awkwardly. "A graffito from just after the Tabaht were beaten, carved with a plasma torch by a bitter nano."

"The guardian of the Tabaht soul." His mind darkens and storms. "To use your words befouls the meaning of my thoughts. It is obscene that you call this tongue 'Truth.'"

Silence. Then: "The Underspine is a filter through which our minds flow, cleansing us of distraction, subversion, novelty, and doubt."

The darkness dances to the edges of his will. "You cannot comprehend."

      <DefaultText>His mind ripples with amusement. "Fear. Vanity. Weakness. Deceit." There is a long silence. "It is your duty to know yourself, and to be yourself."

A thin, silver sliver of thought shoots out from his mind and stabs into your own. It is an image: a battlefield, strewn with countless corpses and shattered war-machines. A regal woman stands beside you, rigid with rage. "Puzzle-breaker, indeed," she sneers.

The image - be it memory or Tabaht deception - fades away, and Kalaghat Anvor offers no more.

The pattern breaks, and its fragments, jagged and disjointed, ricochet across the darkness, crashing into your mind. You feel the terror that has gripped him, the fierce imperative to stand against the outright obliteration of his race, whatever the price. You sense the contempt in which he holds you, mingled with a grudging knowledge that there will come no better chance.

And then there is no more "you" and no more "Anvor", only a madcap image assembled from two puzzles jumbled together, only that and the darkness beyond.

In the end, that is all it takes: his thoughts destroy themselves, unraveling even as they seek to mend the breaches you have cut. Bit by bit, order turns to chaos, and the great light of Kalaghat Anvor becomes a mere shadow.

As he fades, you slip free of the Mindlink, and - moments later - of the Tabaht's tomb.

The symbols that seemed so indecipherable now dance through your mind, arraying themselves in patterns that could not be more obvious. That one is "soldier," and links to "warband," which chains into "army." Here is "battle," and here is "death" - over and over again.

The entire lexicon is yours, elegant in its precision and simplicity: a language bereft of natural disorder.

As your insight begins to slip away, you cling to the worm-won wisdom. It seems you held on tight enough, for the knowledge of Tabaht writing does not leave you when the inevitable stabbing pain fills your brain.

But not fast enough. You thoughts become painfully, shamefully slow, and the puzzle you felt so close to breaking now seems impregnable.

Another worm. Just one more and your mind, honed like a sword, will slice through the skeins. You're sure of it, so sure of it you find yourself sniffing in anticipation, a predator on the scent.

In your mind's eye, you see it, filled almost to overflowing with its sacrifice, proof that the supplicant before Kalaghat Anvor is as war-eager as the Tabaht.

A moment later, it is a drizzle of your own blood that you are wiping away from your lip, your eyes aching and ears ringing from the loss of the worm's gift.

As for the general and his crystal coffin, it speaks of the fear of time's defiling touch, a futile need to halt the world's turning. But the Tabaht are gone; nothing can be saved for long.

And so you sink back down from your high, your brain aching as if bruised.
