      <DefaultText>Indigo waves rise in the wake of the great gray bulk bearing down on Sagus Cliffs. Its flank blocks out the sun; its shadow sweeps over your meager dhow and a whole swath of sea.

From high up on the Marteling Whale's back, a lookout leans down. "Plague!" he cries, in a voice that seems too faint, even accounting for the distance. His warning is needless: the yellowjack flag flapping from the mast can be seen all the way from the city.

Though the lookout stares directly at your dhow, he shakes his head as if he sees no one. The light-bender on your belt glows greenly in confirmation. After a moment, the man wanders off.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Silence, like a miasma, hangs over the empty driftwood shacks. Bits of bone, sheets of synth, crude abandoned tools... these are the only signs that people once thrived in this unusual home.

The lookout has left no tracks, and in the moments you spend scanning the narrow, trash-strewn street, no one else emerges. 

Beyond this bleak emptiness, two things rise: nearby, a kind of pavilion or howdah built atop the whale's head, and in the distance, a huge stone sterncastle at the whale's rear. A beam of light streams from the sterncastle to the howdah, encasing the latter in an iridescent bubble; some sort of shield, by the look of it. There is nothing else of note.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Following the map in your mind, you wend your way down the narrow village lanes. Silence, stench, and squallor are your only companions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a sharp turn, you slip into a small square that is half-smothered by the stench of what at first seems a heap of garbage. Without a shudder, you soon realize it is in fact a mound of rotting bodies.

Almost cornered by the corpse-pile and a rusting sheet-metal shanty, a woman guards a few canned goods against a crowd of lean-faced men and women. Their gestures might seem mere speechless beseeching were it not for the woman's ripped sleeve and one man's bloody nails. The woman hoarsely warns them off, vowing to die fighting. She surely will.

Close as you are to her - close enough to kick the food if you wanted - you remain unseen, thanks to the light-bender.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hustle down the lanes that wind their way up the whale's head, until you are almost flush upon the forcefield. You cannot quite see what lies beyond it: shifting rainbow hues hint at a humanoid shape, but that means little: clouds in the heavens can seem human, too.

The shield radiates enough heat to warn against touching, and the flashes engulf any detritus that brushes up against against it. The only thing that touches it unharmed is a ribbon of power, running from the forcefield all the way to the distant sterncastle. No doubt that is where the shield is generated.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You clamber atop a rickety roof, mindful to spread your weight evenly across the pock-marked synth. Even still, it flexes ominously beneath you.

From on high, most of what you see is the same: a warren of winding, empty streets flanked by filthy hovels, all silent and lifeless. But then a flicker of motion catches your eye: half-hidden behind a mound of garbage, a small crowd seems to have circled a woman. 

You cannot make out exactly what transpires, but you can plot a path through the village to reach the crowd - or to avoid it en route to the sterncastle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At last you arrive at the sterncastle, a tower edifice of steel and stone. That it is a seat of power would be clear even without the ribbon of energy streaming from its tower toward the distant howdah.

A large mob has gathered on the sterncastle steps, and many of the men and women mutely pound upon the gates. Their silence, and the flatness of their affect, is striking. As you watch their ineffectual siege, more file in behind you, blindly forcing you forward, cutting off any means of retreat.

For now, thanks to the light-bender, they have not seen you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The blast blinds, deafens, destroys. When your senses return, nothing remains of the mute men and women but bits of flesh and blood spattered on the ground. Their victim, too, is gone; as is one of the hovels.

The explosion has opened a way straight to the sterncastle, where a far larger mob has gathered. These mutes seem unmoved by the violence you've wrought; silently they pound upon the gates with crude tools or just their fists. More file in from behind you, forcing you forward, foreclosing retreat.</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>You shimmer into view as you fall upon your foes, weaving your blade among them with no wasted strokes. They fall without a sound, and their scant resistance scarcely slows you down.

Two break and run, and you are swift in your pursuit through the winding lanes. But before you can cut them down, you pull up short: they've faded into a far larger mob gathered at the very gates of the sterncastle.

Most of these mute men and women are hammering against the gates with crude tools or just their fists. A few glance your way, and one or two begin to approach. New arrivals file in behind you, cutting off retreat.

You are in no immediate danger, but fighting this many would be no mean feat.</DefaultText>

For her part, the woman breaks and runs; to keep her safe you are forced to give chase. Before you catch her, she slips around a corner and fades into a far larger mob gathered at the very gates of the sterncastle.

      <DefaultText>You are well up the sterncastle's wall before the light-bender's power peters out, and by then you are far from the mob's reach. Indeed, you seem far from their care, as they are content to continue pounding away at the gates.

The climb is an easier one than your last: even without the claws, you wound find easy finger-holds in the weather-worn mortar and rough stone. Above you shimmers the beam of energy fueling the howdah's distant forcefield, but you give it but a quick glance.

Soon, you have reached an open window, and without hesitation you swing your way inside, landing deftly in a great hall.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>As the mob spots you ascending, they fall upon you with the proverbially senseless desperation of the destitute. Sharp-nailed hands clutch at your limbs, cudgels batter your body.

It is what it is. Your climbing claws have sound purchase, your arms and legs are strong - stronger than most anyone's and stronger than those of these sick folk by a wide measure. Eventually, you work your way out of their reach, safe if not unscathed. Above you shimmers the beam of energy fueling the howdah's distant forcefield; below you faces contort in voiceless rage.

You give both sights but the quickest glance before swinging your way through an open window. You land deftly in a great hall.</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>With power and precision, you begin your sword work, and no stroke goes wrong. But there are simply too many, and they are simply too heedless, for skill to turn the tide.

Soon blows are falling all about you. The key is to keep your feet, to not stop killing, to put the pain in its old, familiar place till there is time to face it. You lop off limbs, hack off heads - perhaps half a dozen are dead, maybe more. But they press on, robbing you of the space you need to work.

Then, from above, a rope falls. You grab it and lay about with almost wild violence. In the small space won by this last flurry, you slip away, up the rope and through an open window. 

You land inside with a thud.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crystal's blast blinds, deafens, destroys. As your senses adjust, you see the wreckage it has wrought: a dozen dead; more maimed; the castle gates hanging off their hinges.

Some mutes charge through the breach, but most slip away. Soon, the sounds of a struggle emerge from within - battle cries, even: loud voices full of life. 

By the time you are inside, the fighting is done. The mutes are dead, as are a few defenders. A healer with glowing cyphers cares for the wounded. From a corner, a numenera streams energy out the window.

Their leader looks you over. "Welcome to Folkhaven," she says. "I speak for the Folk." Gesturing at the dead mutes, she spits, "Not the Unspeakables."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before you stand the sterncastle's defenders: a few dozen men and women armed with little more than spears and marlin-spikes. One of them has a few cyphers of the healing sort; another is dressed in a richly dyed robe and adorned with glittergar scales. No doubt she is their leader.

The hall holds little else of interest save a large numenera that streams energy out through a window, feeding the forcefield at the whale's head.

After allowing you to get your bearings, the defenders' leader addresses you, her voice oddly accented. "Welcome to Folkhaven," she says firmly. "I speak for the Folk. You have come in dark times of death, and I fear you may have already faced the Unspeakables."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With an almost casual gesture, you fling the concussive crystal against the shield-generating numenera. The sound is deafening; the light blinding; the force of the successive explosions enough to knock you off your feet.

When your senses return, you see the slaughter you have worked. Most of the Folk are dead: the Speaker and the child among them. Others are wounded. Armless, the doctor slithers across the floor to some uncertain end. Most are dying; all are helpless.

The ribbon of energy that once flowed from the machine, through the window, and to the distant howdah is gone. The hall is dark, and the darkness is rich with the smell and sound of death.</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>As swiftly and softly as you can, you help the wounded take leave of their lives. They put up hardly any struggle.

In truth, they were dead already: doomed by the plague, doomed by the cannons on the cliff, doomed, perhaps, from the day they chose to build their homes on the back of a whale. At worst, you quickened things.

When your work is done, you take leave of the sterncastle and set your sights on the howdah.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>The collar around your neck hums, and a voice warns: "Make haste. The whale has entered Garravia Sound." You heed its command.

As you weave through the narrow paths and alleys, a faint sound stirs in the silence: the shuffle of footsteps, the huffing of heavy breaths. With a watchful eye and quiet tread, you advance, keeping out of sight as best you can.</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your mission was to cut, and so you cut: the Speaker's throat first, and not a word more does she say. 

The rest of the Folk are at first so stunned that they do nothing. You waste neither time nor motion in slicing them down. After a short span, they rally themselves into action. 

It is futile. No doubt they could have killed the mute boy, but they cannot kill you. A few glancing blows and shallow cuts come your way, but in the end the blood that soaks the sterncastle floor is not yours.

Through it all, the Gift sits, docile. There is no cause to kill him. He watches as you smash the key parts of the numenera. The hall falls dark as the energy goes, but the boy watches you still.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Speaker takes the warning well, as if she'd expected as much. "I cannot fault those who speak for your city. We have done the same here to safeguard the uninfected within these walls."

"But we cannot change course from here." She points to the window through which the numenera sends its energy. "The Whalesinger guides the whale from upon its head. And he must be shielded against plague - were he to lose his voice, there would be no song to steer us." 

A grim sort of smile hardens on her face. "But there is a way. You see, a Gift has come to us, a means by which the Healer can concoct an inoculation against the Quiet Death. It comes at a price, one your city will make us pay."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>She points to a boy huddled nearby and calls him over. 

"The Gift," she says. "The only one to fall sick and silent, yet fend off madness." She strokes his hair. "From the fluid in his spine, the Healer will decant a guard against the Death." She gestures for him to sit. "Not a cure. And enough for at most twenty inoculations." 

Many more are sheltered here. "It will do. From twenty, the Folk can grow again, as we did after the Sinking." She smiles at the boy. "The Gift will not refuse, or cry out. He will endure his death in silence." 

She takes your hand. "We will lower the shield, and you will bring an inoculation to the Whalesinger. The whale will turn, and we will survive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With ritual air, the Speaker throws back her shoulders, glittergar scales shimmering. "We are the Folk: whale-farers and truth-tellers, last survivors of the land that sank beneath the sea for our sins."

She continues in a slightly less formal tone. "We have plied the waves for seven generations, never growing beyond the bounds of this, our Folkhaven - a proper scale where each knows all, and all know their places, from Speaker to Gleaner, from Watcher to Whalesinger."

A wave of her arm covers the defenders huddled in the hall. "Now we are few. Perhaps some sinned again in the old, selfish way, and so brought the gods' wrath upon us once more." She shrugs. "Still, we shall endure."</DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>The chiurgeon nods and gestures you toward him. "Sit, please," he says, pointing to a simple wooden chair.

As you rest for a moment, he begins his work with cyphers that are far from simple; relics, perhaps, of some more prosperous time. The care you receive is quick but effective, and at least some of your wounds are gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Speaker is unfazed by your hard words. "The law is what I speak, the Folk's will given voice. I say what must be said, though none may wish to hear it. The Gift is one, and the Folk are many, and that is the way of it."

Then, perhaps reading something on your face, the Speaker places a hand on the child's shoulder. "I carried this boy in my body and nursed him at my breast. You do not give his life more weight than I do, but you give the Folk much less." She strokes his hair, and he gazes up at her, silently.

"Your cannons have left us no other way."</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>She spoke the truth. When the boy is broken upon the chiurgeon's bench, when cyphers bore into his back, he makes not a noise. From his life, twenty-three are saved, each an amber promise swirling in a stronglass vial.

The Healer hands one to you, along with a cypher that will inject it into the Whalesinger. The Speaker gives you a flag - half yellow, half blue. "Wave it when you reach the shield. We will open a way, and the Singer will know you for a friend."

With that, the Folk speak a word of blessing and lead you to a tunnel - dug through whaleflesh - that will give you a clear start. Your path will not be easy; the village is overrun. But it is the only way.

And so you go.</DefaultText>

"They flung the foul thing back, but not before it seemed to touch their minds. Those three were the first to fall silent."

Her voice is low but strong as she continues. "The plague spread up Fishers' Lane, then through the Cannery, stealing voices as it went.

The mutes are not fighters, and desperation can be a weakness as much as a strength. One by one, you lay them low. Their wordless wanting is over, and your path is clear.

You stagger beneath a blow, but come up again, before a club across your back brings you to your knees. And that is all it takes.

It is not a painless death, but anything can be endured with an end in sight. And as you turn your eyes across Garravia Sound to the cannons bristling on the cliffs, you see the Unspeakables' end, too; an end to the Quiet Death; an end to the Folk and their Haven.

Within the pavilion stands a stocky man, barrel-chested and ruddy. The Whalesinger. He seems pleasanty surprised to see you.

Behind him, wide-mouthed tubes rise up from the whale's hide, and past them is the flat expanse of the whale's brow. Not so far beyond are the cliffs, the cannons, and the city.

The Whalesinger's voice booms when he speaks, his words accented like the Speaker's. "I do not know you, stranger, but you have braved the Unspeakables and come bearing the Speaker's blessing. I await your words."</DefaultText>

Whatever fate awaits the Folk and Unspeakables, it will be resolved at sea, far from the city you were sent to protect. As you slip from its shadow, the indigo waves turn azure.

Your collar trembles and the voice returns: "Well done. Cleanly done. Rightly done." Then, silence.

The wind bears you back toward home. You do not bother to watch the vanishing whale with a dying village on its back, for ahead of you grows the great city of Sagus Cliffs, its buildings, then its people coming slowly into view.

He kneels and places a hand on the huge head beneath him. "It is a duty, and an honor, to join the great one's mind.

      <DefaultText>With a gesture to the cannons bristling on the not-so-distant cliffs, you warn the Singer of what will come if the whale is not turned.

Trusting in the Speaker's flag and the clear truth of your words, he gives a quick nod and turns to the tubes rising from the whaleflesh.

It is an uncanny song he sings, inhuman and at the same time heart-achingly intimate. At once the whale begins to turn, heaving its huge bulk away from the city and back to the open seas. And then the song ends, and the Whalesinger takes a long swig from a flask chained to his belt.

"It is done."

She nods to the chiurgeon. "And the Healer knows his craft and his tools. He has said this will not fail, and I speak his words again with confidence."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You race down the whale's head and leap into your dhow. With a swift slash, you cut the harpoon loose. Moments later, the whale is already dwindling into the distance. Whatever fate awaits the Folk and Unspeakables, it will be resolved at sea, far from the city you were sent to protect. As you slip from its shadow, the indigo waves turn azure.

Your collar trembles and the voice returns: "Well done. Cleanly done. Rightly done." Then, silence.

The wind bears you back toward home. You do not bother to watch the vanishing whale with a dying village on its back, for ahead of you grows the great city of Sagus Cliffs, its buildings, then its people coming slowly into view.

They are safe.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the cypher strikes the forcefield, there is a flash of light and a thunderclap - one that seems all the louder for the oppressive silence that preceded it. 

Your senses return, and reveal that you have gotten no good from your effort. The forcefield shimmers on, unperturbed; the umbilicus of energy running from the sterncastle has not flagged; but your crystal is now no more than drit blowing in the sea breeze.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A rope runs from the dhow to a harpoon lodged deep in the whale's flesh. It would be hard to pull free, and in any case it will keep your boat tied to the beast.

The tools of your trade are housed in a locker beneath the thwart: hooked climbing claws, your windslice blade, and a concussive crystal pulsing with explosive power. 

Moments later, the claws are sunk into hide, and - leaving a bloody trail behind you - you quickly climb your way up. As you ascend, the steady lapping of waves fades and the wind grows; but there come no sounds of the living - or dying - village built upon the Marteling's back.

Finally, you crest the whale's flank and pull yourself over the top.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Snug around your neck, a bluesteel collar trembles, and a voice whispers in your head: "Hurry. The seaward batteries can turn the whale to mist if they must, but better to save our fire for a darker day."

After a moment, the collar buzzes again, and the voice adds, "Eliminating contagion is doctors' work, and no doctor would use a saw when a scalpel will do. Go, now, cut what you must, and make sure that this sickness does not reach our city." Finally, the voice says, "And do not be afraid: your body cannot fall prey to their disease."

The collar goes still. The whale's leathery side looms above you like a smooth, living cliff. No simple climb that will be.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Many of the Folk recoil in disgust, but the Speaker does not flinch. "Of course, a stranger cannot know our ways or wisdom." She gives a gesture that suggests exactly what she thinks of your ignorance.

"A spoken lie lasts but a breath, and those who hear it can answer with the truth. But a written lie lingers long past the the lives of those who know it to be false, enduring until it can lead a whole race astray."

She nods decisively. "So spoke the first of the Folk who survived the Sinking, and we have lived since by their words, free from the hazards of pen and ink."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Whalesinger look at the child, then sighs. "When I was young, corsairs sought to seize Folkhaven. Their trabakuls could not hope to keep pace with the whale in all its speed, so they devised a way to stop us: tiny leather rafts, each with a child-hostage, scattered like mines in the sea before us." 

He runs his hand along the tubes beside him. "The Whalesinger then was a dutiful man, and, unfazed by the ploy, plowed through the corsairs' trap. We left them far behind us."

With a sad smile for the child, he says, "The Speaker, too, is dutiful. And neither she nor I will swerve."

He seems to steel himself against an attack he is sure will come. So, do what you must."</DefaultText>
