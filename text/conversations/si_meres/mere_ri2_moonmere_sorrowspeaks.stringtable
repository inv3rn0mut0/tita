      <DefaultText>A world revolves far below you, a sunset in scarlet flaring on the horizon. To the east, deep indigo shadows fall, painting the planet with darkness. The faintest shimmer of a force-screen distorts your vision, and the exhalation of the station pushes warm, moist air across your skin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are in a great hall that is more like an organic space than a constructed room. Machinery literally sprouts from the floors and walls, with no sign of where the synthetic metal gives way to the substrata from which it has grown. Though humid, the hall feels clean and fresh - healthy and vibrant, full of promise.

A holographic map of the moon hovers at the back wall, near a small, glowing pod.

A voice speaks, as if from the air itself. {This is the Specter's voice, but more formal than the friendly version the player meets in the Calm.}"Are you certain this procedure will give you final control over the castoffs? If you're mistaken, the chamber may fail - or worse, detonate with you inside."

The voice is familiar, but you can't quite put your finger on its identity.</DefaultText>

You've pinpointed the source of the voice. It's coming from the staff in your hands. You see a glowing, ghostly human inside the head of the staff.

And then it all falls into place. The voice is familiar because the image is familiar - the ghostly, blue-limned figure is the Specter.</DefaultText>

You've pinpointed the source of the voice. It's coming from the staff in your hands. You peer at it more closely, and you see a glowing, ghostly image - the holographic adviser from the other Mere.

No... this adviser looks different. Augmented. It has the ghostly, blue-limned smoky appearance of the Specter. It *is* the Specter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You glance around the great hall one last time, your gaze lingering on the map of the station, and walk to a small chamber near a vast hallway. A deactivated construct stands nearby in a state of partial disassembly, its hand thrust out as if in offering.

Near the large control panel outside, a column of spongy, scarlet disks hover silently, reminding you of nothing so much as giant blood platelets or congealing scabs.

You take a deep breath and step into the pod. The staff in your hand vibrates slightly, and you feel yourself bathed in energies. "Remain calm. This is all well within normal parameters."

The minor explosion that follows surely is not. Sudden klaxons blare.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>The nearby platelets vibrate furiously, and the deactivated construct's arm begins to spark and flare.

"Get out! The Sorrow is going to destroy you!"

Your nemesis manifests in the great hall. Its form is tenuous, wispy, as it congeals. It gains solidity in fits and starts. The moon's internal defenses are slowing it, but they will not be enough to keep it out. As you watch, the Sorrow shrugs itself past another line of defenses, jerking itself toward a more terrible reality.

Its focus snaps toward you. It coils and writhes, desperate to wipe you from existence.

"Get to another body! We can always make a new catalyst. Go!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>You stop and focus your mind, attempting to use the Tides to carry you, reaching out, trying to find a willing receptacle. All that awaits is the void. The promise of oblivion.

"Update. You're going to have to run for it. The Sorrow destroyed your prime candidate, and the others aren't ready ye... Oh, skist. The others are gone, too. The Sorrow has destroyed every body you have."

The Specter's voice is so tightly calm and professional, you almost can't hear the panic in his voice.

"Escape cocoon. Now. The moon is dead. See what you can grab on the way out, but *do not tarry*, or you will be lost. Run. *Now*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The map is a multi-level projection, oriented strangely, and it takes a moment for your eyes to understand what you're seeing. Once the logic becomes clear, you manage to decipher its language. You laboriously trace the route to a nearby escape cocoon.

      <DefaultText>The construct itself is beyond repair, but a quick study reveals that each of the construct's limbs were designed for independent power. So even though most of the construct is quiescent, its spiked, powered hand is not.

Working quickly, you detach it from the construct's frame. It will be a suitable gauntlet. The powers that course through it might serve to delay the Sorrow's advance.</DefaultText>

It is not easy to remove, howeveer. Working with slow, determined fingers, you eventually detach it from the construct's frame. It will be a suitable gauntlet.

      <DefaultText>You study the staff, and it feels like coming home. It is a familiar friend, a comforting ally. It is the cornerstone to this moon, a key to every lock. You know that with it, you can marshal the station's defenses against external threats... and that it copies your mind weekly, serving as a failsafe and a familiar, a consciousness that is your natural ally.

When it speaks, it speaks with the Specter's voice, and when it must manifest, it can create a ghostly image of the Changing God's 'original' body.

Holding it, you feel safe, in control.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You press it to your forehead. The gel soaks into your skin, leaving behind a dry, viridian paste.

... you are constructing the staff you hold. The Specter speaks over your shoulder. "This is strange, isn't it? Knowing that I'm watching you make my home, that I'm going to be updated in a week with your experiences, that my consciousness will fill this moon, and thus so will you, in an unbroken, indefinite chain."

You say, "I don't hold any illusions about the sanctity of consciousness. But then you know that already. "

He laughs aloud. "This conversation is turning us into a solipsist."

You smile. "We've been called worse."

... the memory fades.

The Sorrow is too close. Its streamers reach out and pinion your arms to your sides.

"*Time is an imperfect circle. Your beginning was your end, but now we terminate too abruptly to close the loop.*" It gathers you close as you struggle, like a mother pulling her child to her breast.

Lassitude settles over you as it touches you. You feel no pain, no fear, and the light slips from the world.

A curling tendril of smoke quests across the screen, flares into solidity, and the ward is gone as if it never existed.

You have already turned and started to run when you hear the Sorrow's mocking laughter.

"*You think to stop me with your 'Tides'? Would you stop the ocean with a stream?*"

It pauses. "*But your audacity is amusing, little human. I will give a few moments to prolong your life.*"

      <DefaultText>You hurl the platelet down the hall. The instant it leaves your fingers it begins to change its shape. It becomes a cloth, a shroud, and it curls over the Sorrow, enveloping your enemy.  It molds itself across the creature like a giant scab, fixing the Sorrow in place.

For a moment you dare hope that you have arrested its motion... but the scabrous fabric cracks, peels, and falls to the floor in a pile of organic flakes.

The Sorrow hisses, "*Flesh does not stop me. Not even flesh imbued with Tidal energy. You know this. Your 'children' know this.*"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pound into the bay. Your breath comes hot in your chest. You double over to catch your breath. Several cocoons are arrayed along the outer wall. You'll need to activate one, and it will spin its webbing around you. The smart membrane is tough, heat resistant, and it will transfer the entirety of the kinetic force away from you at the moment of impact. 

You see an injection of some sort, but it's across the bay. You might not have time to reach it.

And, you reason, if you use it now, it's in your own body. It might carry into the future... if you survive the present.

You slap the injector into your thigh and trigger it. You feel instantly calmer, the world is brighter, and you can hear the Sorrow's inexorable progress. You have a few bare moments before it comes.</DefaultText>

"*The circle is complete, castoff. We will meet again.*"

And then your tattoo blazes, as if it's tearing open, an onslaught of the Tides - all in blue and silver, a stream of information too fast and too large to process.

A mighty blast buffets the cocoon, and you feel one of the Sorrow's inky tendrils caress your cheek and burn into your mind, killing you even as you tumble toward the earth. Almost immediately, you feel something forming deep within you.</DefaultText>

"*Time is an imperfect circle. Your beginning was your end, but now we terminate too abruptly to close the loop.*" It gathers you close as you struggle, like a mother pulling her child to her breast.

Lassitude settles over you as it touches you. You feel no pain, no fear, and the light slips from the world.

What it means, though, is that these things will need to be described in the scene somewhere (possibly here, possibly at the beginning, possibly both):
 - A map of some kind
 - Weird, biological disks that are part of the moon but are having a reaction to the Sorrow's presence.
