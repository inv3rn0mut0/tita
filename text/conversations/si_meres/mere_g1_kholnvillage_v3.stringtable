      <DefaultText>Everything is wrong.

Tash's body - yours now - clings like a wet cloak. The world is too bright for nighttime. Everything is too clear, distances too close, edges too sharp. Memories like blood-flies buzz about your head, whizzing away before you can catch them.

Hard-ridden aneen heave their flanks and huff behind you. Like you, they've gone too long without rest. And there's Matkina. A much *newer* Matkina, as drawn by a pandering portraitist: too soft, too fresh, too pretty. All wrong. {VOICE: To be clear, "And there's Matkina" is meant to be "there is also Matkina" not "And over there is Matkina." I would put a slight pause before, and a slight emphasis on, "pretty."}

On the wastes, you see the light of campfires. And in the humble village before you, a bigger, brighter fire burns. {VOICE: This could end slightly ominously in tone.}

{SOUND [A]: Crackling fire. This can probably carry over into node 2, if possible.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's a pyre. Inside, a body that's too large burns too slowly. Greasy coils of smoke rise into the night. Villagers circle the bonfire, wailing and shaking.

The headman's rough voice continues the ritual: "From exile, you are released." Among the mourners, some echo, "You are released." {VOICE: Probably obvious, the headman should have a deeper, more sonorous voice than the others.}

He throws a handful of powder into the fire - metal salts, perhaps - and a spray of shining embers rises into the night: mostly gold, some green, some purple.

"From wrath, you are released." They echo him. {VOICE: This is the headman speaking this quoted line.}

As the embers float out toward the plains and fade among the stars and campfires, you hear Matkina whisper reverently, "You are released."

{SOUND [A]: Continued crackling of a pyre, followed by a kind of "whoosh" for when the metal salts are flung onto it.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Find the *what*?" Matkina stares at you dumbfounded, and then she shakes her head. "Have a little respect, Tash. This is my home. We're here to save people I've known for years."

A moment later, she adds, "Not to mention, the only danger to memories around here is *you*, Tash. Try your tidal surge on me, and I'll burn those fancy eyes right out of your skull."

There's a smile on her face, like this isn't the first time Tash has teased her or that she's promised a grisly fate in response.</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>Now there's no laughter in her hard glare, and for a moment, she truly looks like the woman who sent you here.

"*Enough,* Tash," she hisses. "They are mourning a murdered man over there. And him?" She points to the headman. "He as good as raised me. I know these people. This *means* something to me, even if the whole world and everything wrong with it is just a barking joke to you."

She looks away from you and back into the pyre.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina answers without looking your way: her eyes are locked on the fire and the flesh inside it. "It's what they do when one of the hill-people dies. Never a burial. Always upward."

"Plains-people, like me, we can bring kindling and weep, but we're forbidden to join the chant." After a pause, she adds, "I never got used to the smell of it. Even when they burnt juniper or balsam. It's worst at the end."

She shrugs. "When it's done, there's no more wailing. For them, it really is a release." She looks thoughtful, but says no more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You push past Matkina and into the ring of light cast by the burning body. The headman gives you no acknowledgment, and before you can say a word, Matkina jerks you backward. "Laak-nibber! These things matter. To them. To *me*!"

When the ritual at last ends and the mourners move on, she leads you to the smoldering pyre, where the headman stands alone. He sniffs at your approach. "Kina," he says. "And a stranger." His eyes are large, milky marbles. He put his hands on her shoulders. "You return in unpleasant times."

She touches his cheek. "I return *because* the times are unpleasant, Neng." Without another word, the three of you withdraw from the fire and enter Neng's home.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the body burns and the mourners chant, you wait in the shadows at the edge of the village. At last, the corpse is consumed and the headman gives a final cry, "To the distant dark, you are released." The villagers echo him, then drift away, leaving him alone beside the smoldering pyre.

Matkina, with a hiss and a gesture, leads you over. He sniffs the air at the sound of your approach and, with a broad smile, calls out, "Kina!" His eyes are large, milky marbles. He puts hands on her shoulders. "You return in unpleasant times." 

She touches his cheek. "I return *because* the times are unpleasant, Neng." Without another word, the three of you leave from the fire and enter Neng's dark hut.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Neng's home is humble and small, hardly furnished and wholly undecorated. On entering, he lowers his weary bulk onto a hassock and gestures toward similar cushions for you and Matkina, then begins without preamble. 

"They hung him from a tree. Old Gareb. Took their daggers to him. Called it 'pruning.'" Blind to others' expressions, he has become oblivious to his own, and he wears his pain and anger nakedly.

With a grunt he continues. "They sent him home by skimmer, along with the *compact* they'd made to the plains-people." He waves at the crumpled sheet of paper on the floor. "Tik read it to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memories try to buzz away, but you are too quick for them. You seize them and squeeze.

This body is - *you* are - Tash. You already knew that, but now you *know* yourself as you didn't before. The body fits better. You're a castoff, and when you call on the Tides, you can destroy memories.

You're a soldier of sorts, in service of the Militia, under the command of Paj Rekken. You're a scout. Matkina's spotter. The two of you are not warriors. You're specialists - you're killers.

But you're not here to kill. You're here to promise something to the villagers, and to get an object, a flute of some sort. The jahk. As for why... that memory and others remain beyond your reach.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memories buzz, and in the sound are flickers of meaning. This body is - *you* are - Tash. You're a soldier under the command of someone named Paj Rekken. You're a castoff who can use the Tides to destroy memories. You were sent here for some *thing* - an object, but exactly what, you can't recall.

There's something more to it, something insistent, important, and endlessly elusive. No matter how hard you try, it becomes no clearer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his wide head. "You're wrong, stranger." He sniffs, as if to catch your scent. "Truly. You've no idea what you're talking about."

Matkina cuts in, her voice soft but insistent. "Neng, I know this is your home. It was *my* home, too. But it's not safe here. Paj Rekken has set aside land for all of you. Deep inside our territory. Where we can protect you."

"It's not so simple," he answers. "Not so easy. Plains-people cannot understand."

      <DefaultText>Neng cocks his head and sniffs. "The Sand Knights call us 'teratomorphs.'" He sneers at the word. "Monsters. But when have we ever hung one of the plains-people from a tree and hacked off his limbs?" He spits. "*They* are the monsters, only dressed in better skins."

Matkina cuts in, her voice quick and insistent. "Listen to me: Paj Rekken has set aside land for all of you. Deep inside our territory. You'll be safe."

"It's not so simple," he answers. "Not so easy. Plains-people cannot understand."

Matkina cuts in, her voice quick and insistent. "Neng, you've *always* tried to keep the peace, but there is always blood to be paid." She takes his hand. "Paj Rekken has set aside land for all of you. Deep inside our territory. You'll be safe."

"It's not so simple," he answers. "Not so easy. Plains-people cannot understand."

      <DefaultText>Neng cocks his wide head. "Why would I doubt her?" He smiles. "There was a plains-child, a beautiful boy. Wandered too far into the waste and was gone. We all gave him up. But Kina?" He puts his hand on her shoulder.

"She left that night with a knife and a lamp and a rope. Just said, 'I'll bring him back.' Hardly spoke back then, our Kina."

She sighs. "Made things easier."

"Week later she comes back, the boy riding her shoulders, a string of chirog heads dragging behind her." He fixes his blind eyes upon you. "When she speaks, I trust. But even if Paj Rekken sets land aside for us, we can't just leave. It's not so simple. Plains-people can't understand."</DefaultText>

Matkina answers, her voice soft but insistent. "Neng, I know this is your home. It was *my* home, too. But it's not safe here. Paj Rekken has set aside land for all of you. Deep inside our territory. Where we can protect you."

      <DefaultText>For a long moment, Neng turns his blind gaze back and forth between you and Matkina. "What it means to be a hill-person," he says at last. "What it's like to wrap yourself in chains every day." He sighs.

"But maybe I'm an old fool. You're not the Kina who left, and you, stranger..." He trails off. "You're soldiers. Maybe you've started to understand what it's like to hold yourself back."

Matkina's answer is sharp. "Neng, all my life I've had to restrain myself. But not in the Militia. It's *freedom,* Neng, the freedom of knowing that what you're doing is right and so you don't *need* to hold back."

The old man shrugs. "Then I was right - you can't understand."

      <DefaultText>Matkina tells Neng to hold out his hand, then whips out a knife and draws it across her palm in a deep cut. Blood wells out and fills his cupped hands. "I would give my last drop to save this place."

The old man curses and spills the blood on the floor. "Bandage that," he mutters. Then: "We can't go without the jahk."

"What?" Matkina asks.

"Up the hill, behind the gate. The cave's been sealed for generations. Inside is the jahk. It's what helps us keep our worst instincts inside. If we leave its song..." he trails off, gesturing to the pyre outside.

After a pause, he leans in, whispers in Matkina's ear. "Now," he says, "you alone of the plains-people know how to open the gate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You work your way up the terraced hillside, leaving Neng to make his case to his people. In the distance, you see that the Sand Knights are on the move, riding hard toward Kholn Village. Neng will need to make his case to them, too.

When you arrive at the cave and its huge, ancient gateway, Matkina shakes her head. "For years I wondered about this," she says. "The hill-people tell a fable that the first men and women came out of here. They said the gate would only open when it was time for people to disappear." She shrugs. "One way to keep kids from poking around and disturbing the jahk, I guess."

Something she said stirs your mind, and your memories jingle like a wind-chime.

      <DefaultText>At once, a glaring light shines over your mission, as painful as it is revealing.

You're not here to help Paj Rekken save Kholn Village. You're here to help Paj *destroy* it. 

She knew the villagers' secret. Knew about the jahk. Most importantly, she knew the Sand Knights would come - knew about their "compact." 

The plan isn't to take the villagers out of the Knights' way. In fact, it depends on causing the very battle Matkina promised would be averted. When the Knights arrive, Paj will destroy the jahk, forcing the "hill-people" into their feral state, unleashing them upon the Knights, weakening one of the Militia's foes.

And Paj is coming in person to see that all goes right.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hurriedly relate your memory of Paj's plot - how she and an armed band will be waiting to take the jahk and destroy it, in order to unleash the teratomorphs upon the Sand Knights in a living trap. At a certain level, the betrayal is so audacious, the plot so callous, that it is unbelievable. And at first Matkina is incredulous.

But then, her face hardens and her eyes flash with rage. "You're serious, aren't you?" She scans the horizon for Paj, and so do you, but there's no sign of her.

"We need to get as far away as we can," she says decisively. "Draw Paj off. Buy Neng time to negotiate with the Sand Knights. And keep them from the jahk."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina, obviously unpersuaded, looks at you with contempt. "Do you even understand what Kholn Village means to me? What the *Militia* means to me?"

Without waiting for an answer, she disarms the locks, opens the gate, and hurries in. You follow.

Inside is no cave tunnel. Rather, it's a smooth hallway made of greenish, phosphorescent ceramic. Under its glow, you and Matkina take on the look of the unburied dead.

There seem to be no side passages, no chambers, just a single path that curls ever inward, like you are in the shell of some great nautilus. From time to time the walls are adorned with lifeless cyphers, arcane charts, even scorch marks as if from a struggle, all inscrutable.

      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>At last you reach the tunnel's end, and there on a pedestal before you is what must be the jahk: a kind of reed flute that plays an endless, formless song, at once almost too faint to hear and too haunting to bear. Whether the music is caused by the breeze blowing through the tunnel or by the jahk itself is impossible to determine.

The ceramic pedestal beneath it - alone of all the devices in the "cave" - still pulses with living energy. That energy causes the jahk to float a fraction of an inch in the air: it doesn't rest on pedestal so much as hang above it.

      <DefaultText>Minding the sequence shared by Neng, you disarm the ancient locks that have long kept the cavern sealed. The gate opens with a gasp, and without waiting, Matkina steps through. You follow.

Inside is no cave tunnel. In fact, there's no stone at all. Rather, it's a smooth hallway made of greenish, phosphorescent ceramic. Under its glow, you and Matkina take on the look of the unburied dead.

There seem to be no side passages, no chambers, merely a single path that curls ever inward, like you are in the shell of some great nautilus. From time to time the walls are adorned with lifeless cyphers, arcane charts, even scorch marks as if from a struggle. They tell no tale for you to hear.

      <DefaultText>You're barely a hundred meters up the hillside before a deafening shriek fills the air and seven people seem to drop out of the sky. One of them is a woman you know immediately to be Paj Rekken. The others must be her bodyguard: tattooed castoffs with drab armor, mismatched weapons, and the languid readiness of predators.

Despite the surprise, Matkina flings a knife before they even hit the ground, and it slips between the plates in one glaive's armor. She's throwing another when a beam of light envelops her, trapping her in a field of energy.

As Matkina thrashes about, their attention is clearly focused on her, giving you an opening, slight as it may be.

There are perhaps a hundred of them.

"The what?" Matkina asks.

"Up the hill, behind the gate. The cave's been sealed for generations. Inside is the jahk. It's what helps us keep our worst instincts inside. If we leave its song..." he trails off, gesturing to the pyre outside.

After a pause, he leans in, whispers in Matkina's ear. "Now," he says, "you alone of the plains-people know how to open the gate."</DefaultText>

He scratches at his chin and seems about to say more, then checks himself. After a moment, he *does* speak, but it seems as if he has changed the subject.

"Years ago, a peddler passed through Kholn Village, selling moving pictures of cities he had seen: the teeming harbor of Sagus Cliffs, the spires of Xakarl, the glittering Oasis of M'ra Jolios. But among all the places, there was none that would be home."

He shrugs. "But you're surely right that they're no worse than these rocks."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pedestal's machinery is alien and wholly novel to you - but that is true of nearly every cypher and artifact in the Ninth World. The key is to stop grasping for the familiar, to stop seeking an underlying logic, and simply to accept the thing before you on its own terms.

With a hard eye and a delicate touch, you tame the device and disarm its trap. The jahk stops floating and bangs twice: first against the pedestal, then against the ceramic floor. Matkina shakes her head in mock disgust, then picks it up.

"We've got what we wanted," she says, and gestures back down the way you came. "Let's go."

      <DefaultText>Once you begin tampering with the pedestal, there's no turning back: it's alive with ancient energy, growing ever more restive and unrestrained under you inept touch.

Suddenly, a shiver ripples through your body - a physical premonition of the agony that swiftly follows. As violent energy courses through you, you cannot move at all except to shudder.

"Tash!" Matkina cries. The split second before she responds seems a lifetime - as it could have been were her reflexes not so honed. She slams into you, breaking the circuit even as the current pass into her.

The two of you lie trembling and smoking on the ceramic floor. Matkina rises first, pulls you up, and takes the jahk. "Let's go."

      <DefaultText>Matkina shoots you a look as sharp as her knives, then steps forward to the pedestal. She sizes it up for a moment, then darts her hand in to grab the jahk. The grace and speed of the motion is uncanny... but not enough.

The instant her hand passes over the pedestal, energy lances upward, convulsing her body. For a moment she's paralyzed - and so are you, by the sight of it - and then, her face wracked pain and determination, she forces herself free. She falls to the floor, smoking, groaning, but alive, the jahk still clutched in her blistered grip.

Pushing herself to her feet, she mutters, "Thanks for the help, Tash." She gestures back the way you came. "Let's go."

      <DefaultText>They're waiting for you at the gate: a woman you immediately know to be Paj Rekken and her bodyguard, a half-dozen tattooed castoffs with drab armor, mismatched weapons, and the languid readiness of predators.

Past them, in the village below, you see the Sand Knights have arrived and are meeting with Neng and the villagers.

Without warning, one of the bodyguards lowers his weapon at Matkina and fires. But she's already moving, and takes a glancing blow. A knife is in her hand as another glaive aims a new device. Before Matkina can fling her blade, she's frozen, trapped in shimmering energy.

Paj herself aims a tiny cypher at the jahk. The others watch, paying you little mind.

Without looking back, you sprint up the hill and down its far side, taking cover between two immense boulders. Soon, a cloaked airship - no more than a mirage's ripple - sweeps across the sky. No doubt Paj's transport. You'll have no such convenience: even your aneen is surely beyond recovery with the Sand Knights' arriving in Kholn Village. It will be step by step.

But a sudden lurching confusion spares you the journey. You feel yourself sloughing off Tash's skin - Tash's mind - then all is dark...

But it seems Paj is not ready to kill you - yet. The bodyguard merely disarms you and drags you back to the others: Matkina in her energy field, Paj looking at you with a mixture of contempt and annoyance.

"I don't know what game you're playing, Tash," she warns. "And I don't particularly care. I just want the jahk. Tell me how to open the cave, and we'll go from there."

She doesn't bother with a bribe or a threat. Despite her soft, almost maternal features, she doesn't need to bluster. Her eyes say everything.

That should be within your power - within *Tash's* power, anyway. When the Tides surge through him, he can destroy memories, the same way you used the Tides to escape the Sorrow in your mind.

Inside the energy field, Matkina trembles with rage, her burning eyes flicking between you and Paj.

Paj sighs. "This is an unfair way to reward friends," Paj says. "But one must secure victory and make amends later."

She points to the slaughter below. "Those Sand Knights are irreplaceable. With a single stroke, we've shifted the balance of power in the Verxulian Waste, and loosened our enemy's iron grip from two dozen villages. You've served the Militia well."

Where once Neng and his hill-people stood, now there's a writhing mass of tentacled *things*, which fall upon the Sand Knights. Caught off guard, a dozen Knights die instantly. Others open fire.

      <DefaultText>Though you are not entirely sure how Tash has wielded the Tides in the past, any bluff will need Matkina's help to work. You approach her and stand so that your faces would almost touch, but for the energy field between you. You close your eyes and contort your face with unexerted effort.

Whether your pantomime is convincing or Paj simply cannot contemplate such a bold ruse, it seems your trick is working.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are only seconds into your ruse when Paj's face darkens, perhaps with anger, perhaps with disappointment, perhaps with outrage that you would attempt such a sham.

Whatever the case, she lifts a finger and before you can react, you are sliced open by one of the bodyguards. As you fall to the ground - filleted and unable to move - you watch them fling Matkina over the cliff. Still wrapped in her energy field, she can't even scream. 

Paj gives you a last annoyed glance, then leads the others away. You cannot see where they go. Darkness gathers around your vision and a sound like crashing waves fills your ears. And then you slough off Tash's body - Tash's mind - and all goes black.

      <DefaultText>"Just throw her off the cliff. Believe me, you won't want her alive after this." Matkina might survive the fall inside the shield - it's her best bet.

      <DefaultText>Paj nods. "You know her better than I do." Not Matkina's cold, killing eyes, she adds, "And your neck may be the one she's most itching to nick." She gestures to her bodyguards, and without a word, they grab Matkina and fling her over the cliff. Still trapped in her energy field, she can't even scream as she crashes into the rocks below.

In the village, neither side has the upper hand, and between the monstrous "hill-people" and the cornered Sand Knights, no quarter is given and no effort is made to avoid collateral damage. It is carnage, no more, no less.

"It's time to go home," Paj says. "The airship awaits." She gestures and leads her bodyguard away, plainly expecting you to follow.</DefaultText>

She places her hand against Matkina's energy field. The fury in Matkina's eyes suggests she doesn't find the gesture meaningful.

      <DefaultText>You stand with Paj at the prow of her airship looking down at the convulsing village. The Sand Knights - the three dozen or so still standing - finally have the upper hand. They move in a defensive square, hurling burning brands into any buildings still standing and unleashing a fusillade on anyone that emerges. 

Only a few of the monstrous "hill-people" still live, skulking in the smoke, among the rubble - you can see them from your vantage. Perhaps they'll kill more Sand Knights before the battle's down. But whatever the final tally, it's clear that Kholn Village is gone.

And Matkina, lying broken somewhere among the ruins, is gone too.

She doesn't wait for an answer, and clearly has no interest in words. As she continues toward the waiting, cloaked airship, the unspoken message is clear: it is time to make your choice.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Paj sighs in exasperation. "If it will make it easier for you, so be it."

She herself leads the sortie down the hillside, flanked by her bodyguards, followed by you. By now, the village is filled with the sharp retort of jezails, the smoke of uncontrolled fires, and the din of screaming voices - some inhuman, some pitiably human indeed. 

Neither Paj nor her followers is disturbed. Paj orders you to keep watch on the path up the hill, slips a mask over her face, and disappears into the smoke with the others. A moment later, she emerges, leading a handful of terrified survivors.

All of you race up the hill and into the airship as the village dies behind you.

She pauses, sighs again. "The lives you'd save... they don't matter. Kholn Village is dead. It can't be saved. It *couldn't* be saved. The teratomorphs are dead - they couldn't be saved either. The other villagers here are no different than ten thousand others scattered across the Verxulian Waste. They'll all die, one way or another, and we can't save them. The most we can do is make use of their deaths so they have some meaning."

      <DefaultText>Whether she reads your lips or intuits your intent, Matkina does her part: first she goes rigid and her face becomes a rictus of agony, and then she slumps - as if drugged - against the energy field. It bulges slightly to hold her upright.

"Good," says Paj. "Leave her. We'll see if our lost tremulan returns to the flock."

She turns to the battle in the village below. Neither side has the upper hand, and between the monstrous "hill-people" and the cornered Knights, no quarter is given and no effort is made to avoid collateral damage. It is carnage, no more, no less.

On the hill, trapped for now in the energy field, is Matkina - her mind and life saved, her will for revenge unabated.

"The Militia's work here is done, Tash. The village can't be saved, and Matkina is on her own. You have been her eyes for a long time, but now she must find her way alone. Consider it a loyalty test."

It is not clear whether she's talking about testing Matkina or testing you, and she does not seem inclined to elaborate.</DefaultText>

Whatever the case, she lifts a finger and before you can react, you are sliced open by one of the bodyguards. As you fall to the ground - filleted and unable to move - you watch them, you see Matkina's eyes upon you. There's nothing she can do. Even if she could move, to reveal herself would be to join you in death.

Paj gives you a last annoyed glance, then leads the others away. Darkness gathers around your vision and a sound like crashing waves fills your ears. And then you slough off Tash's body - Tash's mind - and all goes black.

As you stagger through the smoke-filled chaos, a shape rises up before you: a nightmare of writhing, hooked tentacles. Around its radial mouth are a dozen eyes, each huge and milky white and terribly familiar.

Neng.

Maybe he can't recognize your scent. Maybe he's past reason, past care. Whatever the case, the tentacles grab hold of you and, in an instant, rip you apart.

Darkness comes, and with it, the relief of sloughing off Tash's mind.

As you fall to your knees, she tops it off with a kick to the face. While your head swims, she flips you over, disarms you, and hoists you back to your feet.

Though both of you are subdued, Paj hardly seems happy. "I don't know what game you're playing, Tash," she warns. "And I don't particularly care. I just want the jahk. Tell me how to open the cave, and we'll go from there."

She doesn't bother with a bribe or a threat. Despite her soft, almost maternal features, she doesn't need to bluster. Her eyes say everything.

In the face your silence, she adds, "Perhaps you are wondering what I will do to break you?" She shakes her head. "Nothing. I know you, Tash, and I know Matkina. I *trained* you. Torture won't loosen your tongues, or I'd have one of your beautiful eyes between my fingers."

She points, and as you follow her finger, you see that the Sand Knights have arrived and are conferring with Neng at the edge of the village.

"What I want is to give meaning and purpose to that destruction. What I want is to advance our cause, so that some day when the war is won, I can return and plant a tree in the corpse-rich, ruined earth and thank these people for their sacrifice."

      <DefaultText>You quickly gin up a series of steps and - for the moment - Paj believes you. She nods to one of her bodyguards, who sets off toward the cave to test your method. A few minutes later, he returns and shakes his head.

Paj sighs and lifts a finger. Before you can react, you're sliced open by another bodyguard. As you fall to the ground, you watch them fling Matkina over the cliff. Still wrapped in her energy field, she can't even scream. 

Paj gives you a last annoyed glance, then leads the others away. You cannot see where they go. Darkness gathers around your vision and a sound like crashing waves fills your ears. And then you slough off Tash's body - Tash's mind - and all goes black.

      <DefaultText>Paj looks from you to Matkina, whose contempt for you seems ready to boil over. "But you won't talk, will you, Matkina? Because *this* is where you draw the line: not at all the gallons of blood you've spilled for the Militia, but at one drop from your friends." She watches Matkina thrash, and shrugs. "But all deaths have the same price, Matkina: the question is only whether what you've bought is worth it."

She turns to you. "And you. If only you could read minds and not just destroy them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Paj makes you repeat the steps, slowly, then sends two of the bodyguards into the cave. As you do, Matkina stares at you with murderous rage.

While you wait, Paj points down into the village, where the Sand Knights and Neng are locked in a heated discussion. "So," she says, "the plan flows on."

After what seems like a very long time, they emerge. One of them is wounded, but they have an artifact with them: a kind of reed flute that seems to make music of its own accord. Surely this must be the jahk.

The guard hands it to Paj, who turns it over in her hands, then lays it on the ground. She removes a small cypher from her belt - a weapon, presumably - and aims it at the jahk.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina shrugs. "It could be anything. You're the one who always says a person'll go crazy trying to understand the world."

But from the way she holds a little breath in as she ends the sentence, it's clear that she can't stop there: crazy or not, she *wants* a meaning to it.

"I think the hill-people must have come from here," she says. "Or maybe... come *through* here." She shrugs again. "But we're not here to find answers, we're here to get *that.*" She points at the jahk.</DefaultText>

As for the jahk, you get the sense that there is more than the music to mere wind over pipes - not just tones beyond your hearing range, but that perhaps forces beyond sound itself, a deeper harmony that resonates in more than the tiny bones of the inner ear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hurriedly relate your memory of Paj's plot - how she and an armed band will be waiting to take the jahk and destroy it, in order to unleash the teratomorphs upon the Sand Knights in a living trap. At a certain level, the betrayal is so audacious, the plot so callous, that it is unbelievable. And at first Matkina is incredulous.

But then, her face hardens. "Something's changed in you, Tash. For the better. You *care.*" She takes you hand. "Thank you." Then she scans the horizon for Paj, and so do you, but there's no sign of her.

"We need to get as far away as we can," she says decisively. "Draw Paj off. Buy Neng time to negotiate with the Sand Knights. And keep them from the jahk."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you try to speak, Paj raises her empty hand, and such is the force of her will that you fall silent. Without pausing, she activates the cypher she's holding in her other hand, and a thin beam shoots forth. 

The jahk simply disintegrates.

      <DefaultText>"But that is the voice of pride, Tash. Of selfishness. Egotism. Oh, it sounds sweet, and noble, and just. But it's not."

She puts a hand on your shoulder. "Humility, Tash, is accepting that others know better than you. And sacrifice isn't throwing away your life because you know it is right - that's self-indulgence. Sacrifice is doing what you know is wrong because it is your duty."

She points at Matkina. "How many dozens have you helped her kill? Did you think they all deserved it? I assure you, they did not. But it was *necessary*. So is this."

"A soldier who follows orders is an asset. A soldier who does not is a liability. So now I order you, soldier: destroy her memories."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You unfold the "compact" sent by the Sand Knights. The writing is neat, plain, small, and seems to go on and on in tightly stacked lines. 

In essence, it is a vow to safeguard the villages and towns of the Verxulian Waste from the "menace" in Kholn Village. The Knights promise that they will undertake steps to assure that the killers in Kholn Village never harm anyone again. Extermination is never mentioned, merely implied. 

Beneath the Knight Marshal's chop are signatures from various burghers, mayors, and elders of towns and villages on the Waste. The Knights ask nothing in return from them; the signatures vow nothing. They merely *endorse*, justifying whatever the Knights undertake.

      <DefaultText>The energy field is gone, broken by the fall. Her body's twisted; part of her femur thrusts out of her leg, and blood flows weakly from the wound. She's alive.

You force the bone back into place and bind it as best you can. You're about to sling her over your shoulders when you hear the rasping click of a jezail being primed.

The Sand Knight's hat and cloak are gone. He looks more like a terrified young man than a rawhide killer. But his weapon's steady, and the blood on his clothes isn't his own.

He offers no words before firing. The shot is well-aimed and pierces your heart. No. Tash's heart. For you're already sloughing off his body and mind, plunging back through the darkness...

      <DefaultText>Whether because they recognize you, or simply because you're not one of the Knights, they wordlessly agree to follow you. You guide them to the hill and urge them to seek shelter in higher ground.

Without waiting, you return to the village. The smoke is worse, but the screaming is dying down. A Sand Knight emerges from the chaos.

      <DefaultText>Paj's face is stoic as she looks down from the ship. Perhaps without your preternatural eyes, she can avoid seeing the individuals ground up by her gambit and can see only a strategic point and the numbers it represents in the grand strategy. Or perhaps she has simply learned to set an example to her subordinates in the Militia.

She sees you staring at her and gives a small smile - a generous one, if it's real, devoid of irony or cruelty. "I'm proud of you," she says, and then she walks away to her cabin to plan some new battle.

As she does, Tash's body slips away, his mind lets go of your own - you are falling through space once more, through space and time. Falling homeward.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She lifts a finger and before you can react, you are sliced open by one of the bodyguards. As you fall to the ground - filleted and unable to move - you watch them fling Matkina over the cliff. Still wrapped in her energy field, she can't even scream. 

Paj gives you a last annoyed glance, then leads the others away. You cannot see where they go. Darkness gathers around your vision and a sound like crashing waves fills your ears. And then you slough off Tash's body - Tash's mind - and all goes black.

      <DefaultText>Paj looks at you with exasperation, then fires her weapon. The jahk simply disintegrates.

In the village, chaos explodes. Where once Neng and his hill-people stood, there's now a writhing mass of tentacled *things*, which instantly attack the Sand Knights. Caught off guard, a dozen Knights die instantly. Others open fire.

Inside the energy field, Matkina trembles violently, helplessly. "I understand," Paj says. "But those Sand Knights are irreplaceable." She looks out at the slaughter below. "With one stroke, we've shifted the balance of power in the Waste, and broken our enemy's iron grip on two dozen villages."

Turning back, she adds, "And I promise your pain will be short lived."

{SOUND [A]: Some kind of techno-shot firing, followed by something shattering. A moment later, a distant but terrifying shriek - I'm thinking like the fell beasts in LOTR. Then the sound of gunfire, distant, like pops. Perhaps some very faint and indistinct shouts.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You have no idea how to wield the Tides as Tash would - it's not a power that resides in his body, which you've stolen, but in his essence, which you've shunted aside. You can only try to achieve the same result by guesswork.

You focus your mind and gaze upon Matkina, willing a way to wipe her memories clean. Matkina meets your stare and her eyes have a clarity and half-vacancy that you've seen - that Tash has seen - before she kills. She's past anger now, and come to cold revenge.

But whatever wishes lie behind your gazes, nothing is happens. You cannot cause a Tidal surge through the Merecaster. You cannot wipe her memories.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She swallows, closes her eyes, makes a decision. "They're not human. Sometimes they change, go wild - usually it happens to the young, the old. People in other villages call it 'skin-changing.' And they call the hill-people monsters."

She shakes her head. "It passes and they change back. But sometimes... sometimes they leave the village and never turn back. They lose control. People get hurt."

With a protective edge in her voice, she finishes: "Family. That's what they are. Family, people."</DefaultText>

"Yes," Matkina says softly. "But the Sand Knights won't take shins. *You* know *that*." He grunts. 

"The Militia is here to help, Neng. You are who we stand for - the small, the threatened, the hunted. That's who we are, too." She takes his hand. "Come away. If you tell the Knights you're going, they won't force a fight. They have bigger battles ahead of them, believe me."

"This is our *place*, Kina."

"Paj Rekken will give you a home. Trust her." Neng is silent.</DefaultText>
