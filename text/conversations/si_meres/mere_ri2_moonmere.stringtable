      <DefaultText>A world revolves far below you, a sunset in scarlet flaring on the horizon. To the east, deep indigo shadows fall, painting the planet with darkness.

      <DefaultText>You are in a great hall that is more like an organic space than a constructed room. Machinery literally sprouts from the floors and walls, with no sign of where the synthetic metal gives way to the substrata from which it has grown. Though humid, the hall feels clean and fresh - healthy and vibrant, full of promise.

A holographic map of the moon hovers at the back wall, near a small, glowing pod.

A voice speaks, as if from the air itself. {This is the Specter's voice, but more formal than the friendly version the player meets in the Calm.}"Are you certain this procedure will give you final control over the castoffs? If you're mistaken, the chamber may fail - or worse, detonate with you inside."

The voice is familiar, but you can't quite put your finger on its identity.</DefaultText>

You've pinpointed the source of the voice. It's coming from the staff in your hands. You see a glowing, ghostly human inside the head of the staff.

And then it all falls into place. The voice is familiar because the image is familiar - the ghostly, blue-limned figure is the Specter.</DefaultText>

You've pinpointed the source of the voice. It's coming from the staff in your hands. You peer at it more closely, and you see a glowing, ghostly image - the holographic adviser from the other Mere.

No... this adviser looks different. Augmented. It has the ghostly, blue-limned smoky appearance of the Specter. It *is* the Specter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You glance around the great hall one last time, your gaze lingering on the map of the station, and walk to a small chamber near a vast hallway. A deactivated construct stands nearby in a state of partial disassembly, its hand thrust out as if in offering.

Near the large control panel outside, a column of spongy, scarlet disks hover silently, reminding you of nothing so much as giant blood platelets or congealing scabs.

You take a deep breath and step into the pod. The staff in your hand vibrates slightly, and you feel yourself bathed in energies. "Remain calm. This is all well within normal parameters."

The minor explosion that follows surely is not. Sudden klaxons blare.</DefaultText>

      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>The nearby platelets vibrate furiously, and the deactivated construct's arm begins to spark and flare.

"Get out! The Sorrow is going to destroy you!"

Your nemesis manifests in the great hall. Its form is tenuous, wispy, as it congeals. It gains solidity in fits and starts. The moon's internal defenses are slowing it, but they will not be enough to keep it out. As you watch, the Sorrow shrugs itself past another line of defenses, jerking itself toward a more terrible reality.

Its focus snaps toward you. It coils and writhes, desperate to wipe you from existence.

"Get to another body! We can always make a new catalyst. Go!"</DefaultText>

"Update. You're going to have to run for it. The Sorrow destroyed your prime candidate, and the others aren't ready ye... Oh, skist. The others are gone, too. The Sorrow has destroyed every body you have."

The Specter's voice is so tightly calm and professional, you almost can't hear the panic in his voice.

"Escape cocoon. Now. The moon is dead. See what you can grab on the way out, but *do not tarry*, or you will be lost. Run. *Now*."</DefaultText>

... you are constructing the staff you hold. The Specter speaks over your shoulder. "This is strange, isn't it? Knowing that I'm watching you make my home, that I'm going to be updated in a week with your experiences, that my consciousness will fill this moon, and thus so will you, in an unbroken, indefinite chain."

You say, "I don't hold any illusions about the sanctity of consciousness. But then you know that already. "

He laughs aloud. "This conversation is turning us into a solipsist."

You smile. "We've been called worse."

With a shock, you realize that the view before you is almost identical to the world you saw as you fell to the earth... just slightly higher.</DefaultText>

[This brief intro explains why TCG waited so many years before using the resonance chamber: there was a specific process he needed to perfect before his new body was ready.]

      <DefaultText>"Ha! Given our respective natures, you don't need to tell *me* that. My one benefit is that I'm not corporeal right now, but if I were, I know what my body would be feeling. Of the two of us, your job is definitely the harder."

"Look, we're doing it this way for a reason, remember? I'll walk you through the process. You don't need to worry. I've got it - *we* have got it under control."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"... a castoff? Really? That means... one moment. You say that you have cast your mind back in time to your body?" A note of triumph enters his voice. "That means that this body *is* the proper catalyst. We'll be able to activate the resonance chamber! All right. I need you to listen very closely to me. Your body is the key to stopping the Sorrow. You just have to get into the chamber, and our struggles will be at an end. I appreciate your honesty."

His voice becomes curt. "Wait. If you're a castoff, and this was already your body, that means we didn't make it to the resonance chamber in your timeline. If you change history here, you run the risk of destroying yourself. So what happens?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Was that me? Or was it the man whose body you inhabit now, trying to reassert control over his own form? Did you replace his consciousness when you were born, or did you displace him?" The Specter's voice is soothing, calm.

"I want to assure you that we have no plans to replace you. Our only concern is activating the resonance chamber."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It won't kill you. It will unite you. It will stop the Sorrow, and it will end the suffering that trails behind us. Look, we need to discuss this later. If you're a castoff from the future, it means that in the next few minutes, something disastrous is going to happen. I need to make sure that we have a continuity of experience and knowledge.

      <DefaultText>"Yes." A note of concern enters the spectral voice. "Hold one moment please."

A slight buzzing radiates from the staff. It permeates your being, and encompasses your mind.

"Oh, I see! You're a new mind in this body. How did you get here? Wait. You're a castoff. That means that this body *is* the catalyst. We'll be able to activate the resonance chamber... I need you to listen very closely to me. Your body is the key to stopping the Sorrow. We just need to get you into the chamber, and our struggles will be at an end."

      <DefaultText>"I've already said that we know your body is prepared to use the resonance chamber, but I want to be sure that all of the parameters are within tolerance. I don't know if your Tides have shifted out of variance. If they have, we can try to massage them back within the guidelines your creator and I established. Just step into the pod, and we'll start that evaluation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>{COLIN: The idea here is the player can perform tasks to gain himself time later (or he can just run). The tasks are designed to be varied across the skills. If the player fails, the player still gets the item, but it takes longer.

What it means, though, is that these things will need to be described in the scene somewhere (possibly here, possibly at the beginning, possibly both):
 - A map of some kind
 - Weird, biological disks that are part of the moon but are having a reaction to the Sorrow's presence.
 - A dead construct whose gauntleted hand might still perform some useful defensive function.
 - A hallway to run down.

The illustration for this can carry some of the weight as well.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Sorrow's voice slithers down the hall. "*Age grants neither divinity nor wisdom, little human. Your few years skittering across the face of life have taught you nothing but fear for your end.*"

An explosion rattles the walls, and the Specter's voice moans with terror. "That was the last of the cannons," he says. "We only have wards now - nothing offensive."

The Sorrow calls out again. "*Your end comes now, mortal. Will you face it, as your castoff creations have, or will you die cowering?*"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, for goodness-" An invisible force suddenly *whisks* you into the pod against your will. The staff in your hand vibrates slightly, and you feel yourself bathed in energies. "Remain calm. This is all well within normal parameters."

The minor explosion that follows, however, surely is not. Sudden klaxons blare.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The nearby platelets vibrate furiously, and the deactivated construct's arm begins to spark and flare.

"Get out! The Sorrow is going to destroy you!"

Your nemesis manifests in the great hall. Its form is tenuous, wispy, as it congeals. It gains solidity in fits and starts. The moon's internal defenses are slowing it, but they will not be enough to keep it out. As you watch, the Sorrow shrugs itself past another line of defenses, jerking itself toward a more terrible reality.

Its focus snaps toward you. It coils and writhes, desperate to wipe you from existence.</DefaultText>
