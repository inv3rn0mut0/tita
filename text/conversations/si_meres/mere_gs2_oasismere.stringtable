      <DefaultText>The first thing you notice is the stifling heat. The dry air feels like it's sucking the life right out of you. You stand in the middle of a crowded street. An enormous blue dome towers in the distance over crowded clay-and-synthsteel buildings. The dome shimmers as the sunlight dances across its surface.

Dark men and women jostle past you in brightly colored robes, kicking up dust clouds as they go. The dust glitters gold and silver, but it's just dust and it's making you cough. A beggar sits at your feet, her robes far grungier than those of the crowd.

{SOUND: [A] Crowd walla. [B] Include beggars calling out for shins. These should be ambient and continue until otherwise stated.}
{SOUND: [A] On top of the crowd walla is a woman singing in perfect pitch - almost unnaturally perfect, like the Fifth Element Diva Song. Ambient for this node only.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The beggar is a thin, gaunt young woman, her skin reddish brown from what looks like constant sunburn, her hair bleached almost white, and her eyes green with bluish tints. The light reflects on a smooth, polished metal band around her throat. {The spoken text is said like a chant, almost sing-song}"Coin for knowledge," she chants rhythmically in a pleasing voice, rocking gently. "Coin for pity. Coin for song."​

She sees you staring. "I know you," she says, her normal voice almost as melodious as her chanting. She points at the side of your head. "I've seen that tattoo and that uniform. You're one of the lords of the Endless Battle, aren't you? A castoff? What business could *you* have with the Oasis?"

      <DefaultText>Your accoutrements jog your memories. His name is Hreese Fulc, an officer of the First's Militia. A patch was torn from his uniform, suggesting he is actually a *former* officer. He was exiled for refusing to murder innocent castoffs at Paj's orders - it was cruel and not the kind of thing he wanted to be remembered for. He was shocked that Paj would even suggest it. He never did get a satisfactory answer from her as to why.

Several ornaments hang from your belt - a metal hand, an electronic eye, a dead power core. They're trophies. Hreese's specialty is battling constructs and automatons. These ornaments are a source of pride for him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A strange smile crosses her lips. "Your exile is obvious enough from your uniform - the torn patch is a dead giveaway, I'm surprised you still wear it. But what interests me more are those curios around your belt." She points at the various trophies on your belt from defeated automatons.

She beckons you closer and leans into your ear. "I have a job for someone just like you. I need your help to sneak into the Oasis."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"First time to M'ra Jolios, I see. Yes, I have to sneak in. Oh, for a handful of shins I can play tourist for a day - and believe me, I do, whenever I can. But I long - I need - to *live* there, to be part of their waters."

Her shoulders droop. "But the gibbers make it difficult. They fear what blending the cultures might do, so they place heavy restrictions on who can emigrate. They patrol the borders and monitor the air-skin bracelets sold in Jerboa. You must have connections or money for them to let you in. I have neither."</DefaultText>

She touches the metal band around her throat. "I acquired it some time ago, when I used to live in Sagus Cliffs. I can't say what compelled me to wear it, but..."

She laughs at her own foolishness. "I did. And it gave me the most beautiful singing voice and, as an odd bonus, the ability to breathe water. I began to go by the name 'Tidesinger.'"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She pats the ground next to her and waits until you're sitting down. "The tour groups are our way in. The gibber guards will let anyone past with a guide. Of course the *problem* is that the guides stick to you like..." She searches for the right metaphor, then lets a handful of sand sift through her fingers. "Well, like dust."

She raises a finger. "*Except* at the Menagerie. It's like an underwater museum, but it's so crowded that the guides simply hang out at the entrance. So we enter M'ra Jolios with a group, then slip away and hide ourselves in the Menagerie until nightfall."</DefaultText>

She smiles at your surprise. "You'd be amazed what you hear even on the streets of Jerboa. I know a thing or two, including something very interesting about your militia that's worth the risk."

      <DefaultText>You continue down the road, her pleas bouncing off your back.

Time speeds forward, in the way dreams sometimes do. Jerboa Town is the same the next day in all but shades and shadows. Rumor circulates of a thwarted theft in the Menagerie, of two prisoners - one dead, one imprisoned. But they are only rumors.

Your path takes you past Neme's street once more. She's gone. Nobody knows where she went. Hardly anyone even knows her name - no rumors circulate when a beggar disappears, after all. She may as well have never existed.</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her face lights up as bright as her song from before. "Thank you. Thank you! For a man of your skills, this will be easy, I promise. We'll enter the Oasis as tourists, then hide in the Menagerie when nobody's watching. There's an automaton that guards the Menagerie after nightfall, but I suspect you can get us past that easily."

She smiles. "You won't regret this. Get what you need. I'll meet you at the gates in an hour." Then she gets up and shuffles away.</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>Finding the gates of the Oasis is simple. All roads radiate from the dome like a hub. The air is cool and fresh near the bubble. This close, the waters appear to rise perfectly vertically. You strain your neck trying to see where they disappear.

An energy net shimmers just inside the waters, open only at a single point where several ghibra armed with barbed, glowing spears scrutinize every air-breather who tries to enter. Those with bracelets and tour guides are allowed to pass. The rest are turned away.

Neme suddenly slaps an air-skin bracelet on your wrist. You feel a slight tingle, but nothing more. She points to a group of Jerboans next to a smiling ghibra. "Ready? Let's go."

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>Stepping into the Oasis is surprising. There's no shield or force holding the waters. You walk into them like you might walk into the sea.

Once inside, the tour guide takes you all over the massive city - through the sunken market, an underwater park, the government square. Neme was right; she doesn't let you out of her sight once.

Finally you arrive at the Menagerie. It's just as crowded as Neme said it would be, filled with creatures and curios, as though it can't decide whether it's a museum or a zoo. It's almost overwhelming, and you don't know what to look at first.

"Remember," Neme says, her hand gently holding your arm, "why we are here."

{SOUND: [B] The crowd noise should still be ambient here (but without the beggars, if they were implemented). If possible, some effect should be played over it to show that it's underwater (not necessarily muffled, but some feeling that the sound is getting refracted through the water somehow).}

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>Seeing the robed tourist, you scrutinize the other tourists even more carefully, wondering if any others are observing more than just the exhibits. The robed figure appears to be the only one, but you notice something else - none of the tourists, not even the robed figure, are looking up. Even the ghibra treat the Menagerie as though it were filled with air, its occupants restrained by gravity.

Looking up yourself, you notice a shadowed crevice high above, hidden behind stone structural supports. It looks just big enough for two people to hide in, if you could get there without being noticed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Scores of tourists meander through the Menagerie's corridors. The vast majority of them are human, but there are several ghibra and other water-breathing races as well. A soft current seems to carry them from one exhibit to the next - you can feel the pull of the current yourself, though it's trivial to resist it.

One tourist hovers to one side, dressed in colorful robes and seemingly more interested in the tourists themselves. His gaze moves back and forth across the crowds, but never on any of the exhibits themselves.

Of course he's simply doing what you are, but what is *his* reason for observing?</DefaultText>

He seems intent, though you can't quite discern about what. When you gain his attention, it feels almost as if he is mentally cataloging the details of your appearance.​

He thins his lips. "This one *must* observe, yet the window of opportunity is closing." He shuts his eyes, creating new wrinkles on his face.

He opens them suddenly, looking directly at you. "You seek to hide yourselves until nightfall. This one seeks the same. This one knows of a way we can hide together with little risk.

This one's advice is to run, but not until you have hindered its ability to follow. You have the skills. If you do this, you will succeed."

He lifts his head again. "The code of the order prevents this one from helping with the second part of your task. However, this one can help with the first part."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The plaque calls them lorubs. They are nearly twice as long as a man is tall, with two front flippers and a narrow, tooth-filled mouth. They hum an odd, dissonant tune to each other as they swim by. Neme seems entranced by it.

There must be some invisible field between you and them, because they stay back from the onlookers. There is a pocket of air about two meters above your head. A few tourists floating there are tossing in treats they have purchased, which the lorubs snap up greedily.

Their habitat resembles rocky shoals, with several holes and hollows for the lorubs to hide in.

      <DefaultText>The air pocket over the lorub's cell stretches across the extent of the Menagerie, all the way to the back. You and Neme swim to a far corner where there are no tourists or lorubs. Then, when nobody's looking, you slip over the invisible field and into their cell.

The lorubs' reaction is immediate. Several of them swim toward you, teeth bared. Immediately, Neme begins to hum their strange song. They swim closer to investigate, brush you with their flippers, then swim away.

Sticking to the shadows, you swim deep within a hollow rock and wait. An hour or two later, you notice Iarmid is there with you, though you didn't see him arrive.

The latch turns, and you shove it open. You and Neme slip into the surprisingly warm air of the cell and close the hatch behind you.

      <DefaultText>The Menagerie is much larger than it looked from the entrance. There are smaller curios and cells located everywhere, including all the way at the back. There's even a cell that the plaque says was once used as a prison for air-breathers who broke M'ra Jolios's most sacred laws.

The cell is filled with air. It is empty and dark. It would make the perfect place to hide if you could gain access. There is a hatch that leads into it, tucked away in a dark back hallway. But the hatch is made of thick, heavy synthsteel. You'd have to break the latch to get in.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You point out the crevice to Neme, and she nods, understanding your intent. "Wait here," she says.

She swims away to a back corridor. You can no longer see her, but in a few moments a slow melody of seraphic tones floats through the water back to you. The tourists' ears perk up, and soon all of them are either looking for the sound or have swum off after it. Immediately, you shove off the floor and tuck yourself away in the crevice.

Neme finishes her song and thanks her onlookers. She wanders the Menagerie for another two or three hours before she finds an opportunity to swim up unnoticed herself.

      <DefaultText>These creatures are kept in a cell of air. The ground is black like obsidian, with glowing red nodules here and there. The air in their cell shimmers like a summer day, though you can feel no warmth from where you are.

A plaque says these creatures are commonly called fire wights or flame souls, though they are made of neither fire nor spirit. The Aeon Priests call them nakals. The creatures feed on water and the life force of living creatures, says the plaque. In their natural habitat, they can control and shape magma into impossible architectures. They see temperatures, not light, and so the tourists are nearly invisible to them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is an amulet made of several concentric circles. A thick cord is attached to the outer circle, although it does not appear to pass through the other rings. The circles are just hovering in the center of each other.

A plaque on the pedestal says it is called the Talisman of Scorgil. Myth says it belonged to the legendary Baji, believed a prophet of Ny'kul by the ghibra and a deity by some Jerboans. Its true origins are unknown, but it has belonged to the Giash - the ruling council of the Oasis - for several centuries.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Although you have never learned how to take down an automaton, you find this body knows easily what to do. You get closer to the demon, feinting an attack to its head. When it blocks this critical spot, you bring your blade back against its side, slicing through critical wires and actuators.

The demon makes a guttural noise - possibly a curse. Its body jerks and shivers against its will. It's not dead, but it will have trouble retaliating now.

Even you could only survive a short while longer.

Neme is dead, and you are very close to joining her.

You try to change direction, but you are too weak. As the blade slices through your skull, you realize the demon intended for you to dodge its first blast.

The Menagerie goes black, the pain extending far too long. Finally a new pain joins it - a wrenching in your gut that pulls you back into your own body.

You make your own way down to the surface. As you do, you notice two shadowy figures flying through the water above you. The moon's reflection shines on them for a brief moment, and you catch a glimpse of two castoff tattoos and an artificial eye - Mazzof? The figures disappear into the Menagerie.

      <DefaultText>He shuts his eyes in deep thought, then says, "Her name is Maralel, the one who is thought to be both first and passed. Neither are true. She has faked her own death in order to hide from your sire. Even the Changing God does not realize she is alive, and she intends to keep it that way until it is too late."

He opens his eyes again. "We regret that her current location is unknown to us. It is our hope that the information provided is sufficient. This one can also aid you with your current task."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Iarmid raises an eyebrow. "A clever question. We are permitted to relay some of the information, for this purpose alone. However we must request that you not *act* on this knowledge."

His gaze slides off of you, over your shoulder. "Two of your kin intend to steal the Talisman of Scorgil. It is unknown whether they will succeed or what will become of them. In either case, we believe this event will lead only to tragedy, which is why this Duskwatcher is here to witness. The nature of that tragedy, and its effects on the future, are important to have on record."

He looks to you again. "We regret we cannot relate more. This one can, however, aid with your current task."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at you with a sudden warmth in his eyes. "I cannot predict whether this night will succeed - that depends on the choices *you* make - but yes, if Neme survives this night, then it is very likely she will find a home here. Her plan is a wise one, and the ghibra are unlikely to care."

The intensity returns to his face. "To aid in that success, this one has information on your current task."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He points his chin at the tank of dangerous-looking creatures. "The lorub's cell is large, with several places for all of us to hide until nightfall. Unfortunately, the lorubs themselves would destroy any air-breather foolish enough to step into their habitat."

He nods at Neme. "You have a gift, however. Your numenera enables you to match any pitch and timbre. Listen to the lorubs. You will find that emulating their song is enough for them to leave you alone. If you hide in there, this one will see and find a way to join you."

He brings his hand up to his face, making a strange gesture with his fingers. "This one is grateful for any assistance you choose to provide."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You aim the lance at its head and fire. The beam strikes a glancing blow across the side of the thing's face, doing damage, but not blinding it.

It turns back and shows an inhuman grin. "I was *made* for this, perfectly designed to kill you. There is no chance you will survive."

      <DefaultText>You swim closer, slicing at vital components on the demon's side. Just as you think you've done it, one of its bladed arms deflects your blow. It is damaged, but not disabled.

"I served the Tabaht in their golden age. I hunted down races that your people don't even remember. Did you think I could be taken down so easily by *you*?"

      <DefaultText>You see the demon around the corner, a construct bristling with spikes and blades. You, Neme, and Iarmid are too many to hide, and it sees you immediately. Before you can react, it fires a blast of energy that causes the water surrounding you to burn like fire.

When your vision returns, Iarmid is gone. Neme is still next to you, breathing heavily within her air-skin bracelet. It doesn't look like she could take another hit like that. Even you could only survive a short while longer.

You have a beam lance bracer on your forearm, but you suddenly wonder if that will be enough.

      <DefaultText>"But what blessing is without its curse?" She looks wistfully in the direction of the blue dome. "Mine is an overwhelming urge to immerse myself in water. I *need* it. I *ache* for it." She squeezes her fists until her knuckles become white.

She lets go and sighs. "I came here hoping to move into the Oasis, but their immigration laws are quite strict. I sing for money here in Jerboa, spending a day in M'ra Jolios whenever I have enough scraped together, but it's not enough. I need *more*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"However," she leans in eagerly, "if you can avoid their patrols and breathe without a bracelet - as I can - then it *is* possible.

      <DefaultText>A shadow crosses her face. "This is the tricky part. The Menagerie is guarded by a demon - an automaton from a prior world."

She playfully flicks a construct's eye hanging from your jacket. "But I suspect you know a thing or two about dealing with *those*, don't you? With your skills, we should be able to sneak past it no problem."</DefaultText>

You are a discarded shell of the one who calls himself the Changing God. You are known through your brand. She is known through her habits. It is the same."

He shuts his eyes for a moment as if deep in thought. When he opens them again, he says, "Yes, we can also guess at your purpose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The field that separates the lorubs from the tourists must not extend to the air pocket above, because the tourists are reaching right through to toss in their treats. It would be a simple thing to jump in when nobody's looking, but of course then the lorubs would likely tear you to shreds.

      <DefaultText>Then it's just a matter of waiting for nightfall. Hours pass. Tourists and tour guides leave one by one. The guides don't seem to keep track of who they brought, acting only as chaperones for tourists who wish to return. The remainder are accompanied out at sunset.

The Menagerie is dark and empty. Sunlight that had been filtering in from translucent rocks in the ceiling is now gone. Only a few fish and rocks still light the gloom.

You emerge from your hiding place, moving as quietly as possible. But as soon as you reach the main corridor, a metallic voice carries from the direction of the front entrance. "Did you think I would not see? Would not know? You will die here tonight."
