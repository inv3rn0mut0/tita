      <DefaultText>You look down at yourself. You are a woman, kitted out with sturdy armor, a staff with blades at both ends, and a geometric tracery of filaments all over your body that you somehow know allows you to "fall" up, which is handy for spelunking and scavenging. 

Besides the bearded nano, whose name you remember is Ushrov, the others around you are Marit, your jack marksman, Iom, a self-aware construct, and Arxalin, a varjellen glaive whose reptilian features always seem to be smiling, even now, when he's on the floor, clutching his guts, with black fluids leaking from his nose and mouth. 

"I'm not asking to go back," Arxalin hisses. "Just let me close my eyes and rest a minute." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"W-what is it?" asks Marit. 

It takes a moment for Iom to answer. He seems preoccupied. "Some kind of universal energy emitter. I can feel its power, but perhaps some of the energy it emits is deadly to organics."

"The real question," says Ushrov. "Is who planted it on him. Didn't he say he threw it away?"

Everybody looks at everybody else, but then Marit sobs. "It was me! I picked it up when he dropped it and it recharged all my cyphers in a blip. Big money back home for a thing like that, but it made me queasy to touch it, so I slipped it into Arx's pack. I didn't think it was going to kill him!"

As she bursts into tears, you hear the same noise you heard earlier, only closer. The rest hear it too.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a long trek, you reach the place where you entered the tube, a span called the Forever Bridge that stretches across the voil to where the caravan master waits for your return.

Except for Iom, you're all in bad shape. Marit is hacking her lungs up, and you and Ushrov are starting to sniffle - and to make matters worse, the Forever Bridge is toying with you. Every time you start across it, you find yourself walking back toward the cave. You can't reach the other side. 

Finally, after a third attempt, Marit collapses, barely consious, and Ushrov turns on Iom. "The Embrace is still killing us. You have to get rid of it."

Iom shakes his head. "I won't. I have a right to life."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ushrov roars and Marit stares, uncomprehending, as you drift though the gash in the side of the tunnel and rise toward the top of the canyon. 

"What are you doing!" shouts Ushrov up at you. "This doesn't fix anything!"

As you reach the top of the Voil it begins to fade to gold mist below you, and you are wrenched back to your own body, Ushrov's last words ringing in your ears.

"A lot of folk are going to die because of this, you coward!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Marit wails and reaches after you as you and Ushrov drift though the gash in the side of the tunnel and rise toward the top of the canyon. 

"I'm grateful for the rescue," says Ushrov, scowling. "But what exactly did that accomplish? Iom will climb out of there in a heartbeat, and then what happens to Stirthal, or wherever he ends up? He's a walking plague."

      <DefaultText>Iom remains still for so long you think he might be broken. Finally he steps to the gash in the side of the tunnel and hurls the Embrace out into the Voil. 

Then he turns to you. "Forgive me, Vic. In my fear, I forgot why being alive is important. I am ready to help you save our friends."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A nano with a heavy beard shouts at you as your other companions stare. "Come on, Vicarian! We can't afford to be nice. If we go back empty-handed our investors will kill us!"

You're in a tube-like cave, several stories high and many kilometers long, that looks like it was chewed from solid rock by a colossal worm. Around you, a hollow square of rust-red columns rises to the ceiling, and you can see further ruins east and west. To your right, a long gash in the north wall of the tube opens to daylight and a vast canyon, as if the titan worm rubbed through the canyon wall in passing. 

Faint memories tell you the tube-cave is a numenera motherlode - and your party is the first one in. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you say it, a faint shifting echoes down the tunnel from the west, as if something was moving in the distance. The party looks toward the sound. Arxalin swallows. "If it's all the same to you," he says. "I'd rather not sit here alone."

"I will carry you, if you like," says Iom. "You will not slow me down."

The varjellen grimaces with embarrassment, then shrugs. "Fine. Just call me dead weight."

As you start forward, Marit sniffs and wipes her nose on her sleeve. 

"Can't you be quiet?" Ushrov snarls. "We don't know what's out there!"

"Sorry," she mumbles. "Arxalin being sick is giving me sympathy sniffles."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looking out through the ragged gash, you see the canyon dropping straight down below you, so deep the afternoon sun doesn't reach the bottom, and so wide you can barely see the other side through the haze. This, you know, is the Voil Chasm, a great gash in the Malevich wilds that sane travelers tend to avoid. 

Pulling your head back in and looking up and down the long cave, you see that it rises slightly to the east, where you entered it. It descends to the west, where you have yet to explore.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vargellan moans. "I don't know. Could have been that thing I found back in the forge room. Shiny bit of flex, but when I touched it, it made me queasy, so I tossed it aside. Maybe one touch was enough. Now I've got a fever like a furnace, and I feel like I could drink the Sadara River dry."

"I don't want to hold us up, though. I know there's a lot riding on this venture. Just give me a minute to nap and let the quell root to kick in and I'll be ready to go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The burly nano blinks at you. "You're asking me? You're the one that got the consortium to put up five thousand shins for this expedition - you and your construct friend. If we come back after one day on-site with nothing but a handful of cyphers to show for it, they're going to have our heads. They'll at least want their investment back, and we haven't got it!"

"Maybe you and Iom will be all right, with your vagabond ways, but I've got a wife and kids. I can't just walk away from Stirthal like some people."

He looks down at Arxalin, then away. "I feel bad about it. I really do, but going back isn't an option. He's going to have to wait until we've stripped this place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She coughs, then looks out at you from under her hood. One of her eyes is white with a red dot in the center - a targeting implant. "I know we'll catch flak from the consortium if we go back with nothing, but poor Arxalin is going to die if we don't get out of here and we might be next. What if whatever he's got is catching? I say we get him back home, get ourselves checked, then come back."

Ushrov laughs at her. "Go home and come back? Fool, almost all our costs in this expedition are in transport. That caravan master who's waiting for us at the bridge charges by the kilometer! We'd have to raise our capital all over again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>To the casual eye, from a distance, Iom might pass for human, but his skin and features are too perfect, and his movements too smooth. You have also seen him lift ten times his weight.  He answers you without gesturing or blinking. "I suggest it will not matter if we leave or stay. Glaive Arxalin will die before he receives medical attention in either case. His illness is too far advanced."

His circuits tick for a moment, then he continues. "You have worked hard to make this expedition happen since I brought you that old journal. Is it really your wish to turn back now, Vic? You said this would all go toward your triumphant return to Sagus Cliffs, remember?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A while later, as you enter a ring of fallen tents among ancient pylons, Iom stops and lowers Arxalin to the ground. "The glaive is dead," he says. "His heart just stopped."

You and the others look at Arxalin. He is covered in a black slime that leaks from cracks in his reptilian skin. Marit chokes and covers her mouth. "That's not what I've got, is it? Humans and varjellens don't get sick from the same things, right?"

"I am not sure it is a disease at all," says Iom, searching Arxalin's things. "Too quick. I--"

He pauses, then tugs a rolled up piece of silver flex from Arxalin's pack. It is covered with tiny metal studs. "If something killed him, it was likely this."

      <DefaultText>You wait for something to come out of the dark, but nothing appears. Then, beside you, Arxalin wakes, choking and clawing at his throat, before he falls back, dead.

You call back Marit and Ushrov and they join you and Iom by Arxalin. He is covered in a black slime that leaks from cracks in his reptilian skin. Marit chokes. "That's not what I've got, is it? Humans and varjellens don't get sick from the same things, right?"

She coughs and sniffs, then wipes her eyes and continues. "I hid it because I was pretty sure it was the thing Iom had been talking about, and... well, I knew, if he took it, the rest of us wouldn't get any shins for it, so I thought I'd sell it myself, but now I'm..."

      <DefaultText>You push further west and come to a rubble strewn area full of well preserved transport constructs, half-buried in the drit, that look like they might yield valuable parts. Before you can begin opening them up, however, you hear the same shifting sound you all heard earlier, only much closer now. The ground begins to tremble. 

"Everyone back up!" you cry. "Ready your weapons!"

The others have no time to obey. The ground in front of you suddenly erupts from below, and a large, worm-like horror bursts forth, flailing multiple arms and tentacles at all of you. At the same time, all around it, bits of rubble float up and fling themselves at you.

Before you can reply, you hear the same shifting sound you all heard earlier, only closer now, and approaching rapidly. The ground begins to tremble. 

"Incoming!" you cry. "Ready your weapons!"

You and Ushrov grab her and drag her, but as you pass the square of rust red columns, you realize the thing isn't following anymore. 

"We can stop now," says Iom. "It will not follow unless we steal what it is guarding."

"What is it guarding?" asks Ushrov. "Something valuable?"

"Who can say what an Erynth Grath considers valuable?" says Iom. "It could be anything. It could be nothing."

Then, in the middle of the night, you wake to find yourself shivering and wheezing. Black snot is streaming from your nose, and when you spit, that's black too. Ushrov is trembling beside you. He's in the same straits. 

"Nano spirits preserve us," he moans. "We've got it too."

He turns to Marit and shakes her, but she doesn't wake. She's long dead. Ushrov sits up and looks around. "Iom! Iom, you bastard! Where are you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ushrov grumbles under his breath, but sits down with the rest of as the suffering glaive closes his eyes. A moment later, a faint shifting echoes down the tunnel from the west, as if something was moving in the distance. The party looks toward the sound. Even Arxalin wakes.

"Creature or claim jumper?" he asks. 

Marit and Ushrov excahnge looks, then start west, angling for vantage points. 

"Can't you be quiet?" Ushrov snarls as Marit sniffs and wipes her nose on her sleeve.

"Sorry," she mumbles. "Arxalin being sick is giving me sympathy sniffles."

      <DefaultText>As you say it, a faint shifting echoes down the tunnel from the west, as if something was moving in the distance. The party looks toward the sound. Arxalin swallows. "Monsters," he says. "Fantastic. And I'm going to be the straggler."

"I will carry you, if you like," says Iom. "You will not slow me down."

The varjellen grimaces with embarrassment, then shrugs. "Fine. Just call me dead weight."

As you start forward, Marit sniffs and wipes her nose on her sleeve. 

"Can't you be quiet?" Ushrov snarls.  "We don't know what's out there!"

"Sorry," she mumbles. "Arxalin being sick is giving me sympathy sniffles."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A while later, as you enter a ravine full of shattered synthsteel pods, Iom stops and lowers Arxalin to the ground. "The glaive is dead," he says. "His heart just stopped."

All of you look at Arxalin. He is covered in a black slime that  leaks from cracks in his reptilian skin. Marit chokes and covers her mouth. "That's not what I've got, is it? Humans and varjellens don't get sick from the same things, right?"

"I am not sure it is a disease at all," says Iom, searching Arxalin's things. "Too quick. I--"

He pauses, then tugs a rolled up piece of silver flex from Arxalin's pack. It is covered with tiny metal studs. "If something killed him, it was likely this."

"Why me?" asks Marit, staring back at the tunnel. "I'm not going to make it. And you left Ushrov alive with that..."

He reacts as you hoped, throwing both masonry chunks at you and allowing Marit and Ushrov to catch him in a cross fire. Unfortunately, you aren't quite quick enough to dodge both misslies, and the second explodes your ribcage and crushes your heart. 

The cave and the Voil fade to gold mist around you as Ushrov's blasts fry Iom's circuits and Marit's beamer burns a hole through his synthsteel head. As you die, you are wrenched back to your own body, the cheers of the others ringing in your ears. </DefaultText>

As Iom twitches and tries to pick up another stone, you rush in and chop his head from his torso. It blinks up at you, the lights in its eyes dying, as the cave and the Voil fade to gold mist around you. As you are wrenched back to your own body, Iom's last words ring in your ears.

Except for Iom, you're all in bad shape. Marit is hacking her lungs up, and you and Ushrov are starting to sniffle - and to make matters worse, the Forever Bridge is toying with you. Every time you start across it, you find yourself walking back toward the cave. You can't reach the other side. 

Finally, after a third attempt, Marit collapses, barely consious, and Ushrov turns on Iom. "You've still got the Embrace, don't you, you bastard? You're killing us all!"

"I hid it because... well, you know I'm kind of desperate for shins right now, and it'll take forever when we get back for Ushrov to sell off our haul and pay back the investors.

You give him the nod and watch as he tucks the Embrace under Arxalin's belt, then lifts him and carries him to the gash in the side of the tunnel. He leans out into the evening air and lowers his arms, then lets the varjellen go and bows his head respectfully.

Finally, after a third attempt, Marit collapses, barely consious, and Ushrov turns on Iom. "You've still got the Embrace, don't you, you bastard? You're killing us all!"

      <DefaultText>You turn with the rest and run up the tunnel. The horror scrabbles after you, and nearly catches Marit, who is wheezing and weak.

You and Ushrov grab her and drag her, but as you pass the square of rust red columns, you realize the thing isn't following anymore. 

"We can stop now," says Iom. "It will not follow unless we steal what it is guarding."

"What is it guarding?" asks Ushrov. "Something valuable?"

"Who can say what an Erynth Grath considers valuable?" says Iom. "It could be anything. It could be nothing."

Ushrov turns to you, eyes bright. "You heard him, Vic. Let's go back and see what it's got."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You return to the place where the Erynth Grask attacked you, and once again it rises from the ground and attacks with claw and tentacle and telekinesis. 

Marit and Ushrov fire their beamers and esoteries at the beast as you and Iom rush it, but it is twisty and quick and darts past you to clutch at Ushrov with one of its tentacles, which causes him to twitch and dance, while telekinetically hurling rocks at the rest of you. One of them pastes Marit in the face, and she goes down, reeling, unable to defend herself against the others that are arcing her way. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You face Marit, who huddles, coughing and sniffing, before you. "Aren't I already being punished?" She asks. "I've got what Arx had, and it's a death sentence."

Before you can reply, you hear the same shifting sound you all heard earlier, only closer now, and approaching rapidly. The ground begins to tremble. 

"Incoming!" you cry. "Ready your weapons!"  

The others have no time to obey. The ground off to one side suddenly erupts, and a large, worm-like horror bursts forth, flailing multiple arms and tentacles at all of you. At the same time, all around it, bits of rubble float up and fling themselves at you.

      <DefaultText>The construct nods. "Very well, Vic. I'll just dispose of Arxalin first."

You give him the nod and watch as he lifts the glaive and carries him to the gash in the side of the tunnel. He leans out into the evening air and lowers his arms, then lets the varjellen go and bows his head respectfully.

"Vic, I decided to help you in your scavenging all those years ago because I hoped, if we searched enough ruins, that I would find a power source compatable with my construction. We never have, and I feared that I was a one-off, and that, when my battery finally ran down, I would die, never to be recharged. This artifact, however, powers everything. I can feel it restoring me even now. With it, I might live forever. Without it, I am mortal."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A thick-bearded nano shouts at you while others stare on. "Come on, Vicarian! We can't afford to be nice. If we go back empty-handed the Harrows is gone!"

You find yourself in a tube-like cave, several stories high and many kilometers long. It looks like it was chewed from the solid rock by some colossal worm. A hollow square of rust-red columns rises to the ceiling around you. Further ruins lie both east and west. To one side, a long gash in the north wall of the tube opens to daylight and a vast canyon. 

Faint memories tell you the tube-cave is a numenera motherlode - and your party is here to grab as much as they can get.

      <DefaultText>The body you wear belongs to a woman, kitted out with sturdy armor, a bladed staff, and a geometric tracery of filaments all over your body that you somehow know gives you the uncanny ability to control your local gravity.

You know, too, the names of those beside you. The bearded nano is Ushrov. The others are Marit, a young markswoman; Iom, a self-aware construct; and Arxalin, a varjellen glaive whose reptilian features always seem to be smiling - even now, when he's on the floor, clutching his guts, with black fluids leaking from his nose and mouth. 

"I'm not asking to go back," Arxalin hisses. "Just let me close my eyes and rest a minute."</DefaultText>

This, you know, is the Voil Chasm, a great gash in the Malevich wilds that sane travelers tend to avoid. 

Pulling your head back in and looking up and down the long cave, you see that it rises slightly to the east, where you entered it. It descends to the west, where you have yet to explore.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The varjellen moans. "I don't know. Could have been that thing Ushrov and I found back in the forge room. Shiny bit of flex that lit up half my equipment. But when I touched it, it made me queasy, so I got rid of it. Maybe one touch was enough. Now I've got a fever like a furnace, and I feel like I could drink the Sadara River dry."

      <DefaultText>The burly nano glares at you. "This is what we get for hiring a mercenary. The neighborhood scrounged together the last shins it had for this expedition because you promised we'd bring back enough quality artifacts to purchase the land under the Harrows for ourselves and stop Duke Rask from turning it into a granary. If we go back after one day on-site with only a handful of cyphers to show for it, four thousand people are going to be turned out of their homes. We are their last chance, Vicarian. Don't pretend you don't know it."

He looks down at Arxalin, then away. "I feel bad about Arx, I really do, but going back isn't an option. He'll have to wait until we've stripped this place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She coughs, then looks out from under her hood. One eye is white with a red dot - a targeting implant, the other eye is blue - exactly like Bairn's, your dead husband. 

It all comes back. Marit is Bairn's daughter, who ran to the streets when you moved in, and who you've been trying to tame since he died. A month ago you finally convinced her that joining your salvage company was a safer life than cutting purses. She's still as skittish as a rubar.

"I know we're letting down a lot of people if we go back with nothing," she says. "But the varjellen is gonna die if we don't get him help, and we might be next. What if he's contagious? Let's get him home, get checked, then come back."</DefaultText>

That caravan master who's waiting up at the bridge charges by the kilometer! We'd have to raise the money all over again, and the people of Harrows don't have it! You and your mother have already taken all they had!"

"And what happens if we don't come back at all?" asks Marit. "There's nothing you can do to stop Rask if you're dead, is there?"

You have also seen him lift ten times his weight.  He answers you without gesturing or blinking. "I suggest it will not matter if we leave or stay. Glaive Arxalin will die before he receives medical attention in either case. His illness is too far advanced."

His circuits tick for a moment, then he continues. "I will of course do as you wish, Vic, but do you really want to turn back now? You said your share of this venture would finally allow you to return to Sagus Cliffs, remember?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you say it, a faint shifting echoes down the tunnel from the west, as if something was moving in the distance. The party looks toward the sound. Arxalin swallows. "If it's all the same to you," he says. "I'd rather not sit here alone."

"I will carry you, if you like," says Iom. "You will not slow me down."

The varjellen grimaces with embarrassment, then shrugs. "Fine. Just call me dead weight."

As you start forward, Marit sniffs and wipes her nose on her sleeve. 

"Can't you be quiet?" Ushrov snarls. "We don't know what's out there!"

      <DefaultText>A while later, as you enter a ravine full of shattered synthsteel pods, Iom stops and lowers Arxalin to the ground. "The glaive is dead," he says. "His heart has stopped."

All of you look at Arxalin. He is covered in a black slime that  leaks from cracks in his reptilian skin. Marit chokes and covers her mouth. "That's not what I've got, is it? Humans and varjellens don't get sick from the same things, right?"

"I am not sure it is a disease at all," says Iom, searching Arxalin's things. "Too quick. I-"

He pauses, then tugs a rolled up piece of silver flex from Arxalin's pack. It is covered with tiny metal studs. "If something killed him, it was likely this."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Iom looks at the flex. He doesn't seem to be able to tear his eyes from it. "Vic, I've helped you in your scavenging for all these years because I hoped, if we searched enough ruins, I'd find a power source compatible with my construction. We never have, and I've come to believe that I was a one-off, and that, when my batteries finally ran down, I would die, never to be recharged. This artifact, however, powers everything. I can feel it restoring me even now. With it, I might live forever. Without it, I am mortal."</DefaultText>

You watch as he tucks the Embrace under Arxalin's belt, then carries him to the gash in the side of the tunnel. He leans out into the evening air and lowers his arms, then lets the varjellen go and bows his head respectfully. 

You and the others follow his lead, observing a moment of silence, then Iom pulls his torso back through the gash and turns to you.

Before you can shout an order, the ground in front of you suddenly erupts from below, and a large, worm-like horror bursts forth, flailing multiple arms and tentacles at all of you. All around it, bits of rubble float up and fling themselves at you.

"An Erynth Grask," states Iom.

One of them pastes Marit in the face, and she goes down, reeling, unable to defend herself against the others that are arcing her way. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You face Marit, who huddles, coughing and sniffing, before you. "Aren't I already being punished?" She asks. "I've got what Arx had, and it's a death sentence."

Before you can reply, you hear the same shifting sound you all heard earlier, only closer now, and approaching rapidly. The ground begins to tremble. 

"Incoming!" you cry. "Ready your weapons!"  

The others have no time to obey. The ground off to one side suddenly erupts, and a large, worm-like horror bursts forth, flailing multiple arms and tentacles at all of you. At the same time, all around it, bits of rubble float up and fling themselves at you.

      <DefaultText>"We risk four lives if we stay," growls Ushrov. "And four thousand if we go." Still he follows as you head toward the exit. Then a faint shifting echoes from the west end of the tunnel, far in the distance. Arxalin swallows. "Monsters," he says. "Fantastic. And I'm going to be the straggler."

"I will carry you, if you like," says Iom. "You will not slow me down."

The varjellen grimaces with embarrassment, then shrugs. "Fine. Just call me dead weight."

As you continue on, Marit sniffs and wipes her nose on her sleeve. 

"Can't you be quiet?" Ushrov snarls.  "We don't want it following us, whatever it is!"

      <DefaultText>A while later, as you enter a cluster of ancient pylons you previously searched, Iom stops and lowers Arxalin to the ground. "The glaive is dead," he says. "His heart has stopped."

You and the others look at Arxalin. He is covered in a black slime that leaks from cracks in his reptilian skin. Marit chokes and covers her mouth. "That's not what I've got, is it? Humans and varjellens don't get sick from the same things, right?"

"I am not sure it is a disease at all," says Iom, searching Arxalin's things. "Too quick. I-"

He pauses, then tugs a rolled up piece of silver flex from Arxalin's pack. It is covered with tiny metal studs. "If something killed him, it was likely this."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ushrov grumbles under his breath, but sits down with the rest of as the suffering glaive closes his eyes. A moment later, a faint shifting echoes down the tunnel from the west, as if something was moving in the distance. The party looks toward the sound. Even Arxalin wakes. "Creature or claim jumper?" he asks. 

Marit and Ushrov exchange looks, then start west, angling for vantage points. Marit sniffs and wipes her nose on her sleeve.

"Wonderful," growls Ushrov. "We've been sabotaged by your step-daughter. You promised me the little brat was over her thieving ways. Now she's gotten one of us killed!"

      <DefaultText>The cave and the Voil fade to gold mist around you  as you, Marit, and Ushrov turn and start deeper into the cave once again. The last thing you hear as you are wrenched back to your own body is Ushrov's voice. 

"I misjudged you, Vicarian. You're a woman of your word. Thank you."

"So, the only difference between us is that I steal and you murder. Good to know."

      <DefaultText>After a long trek, you reach the place where you entered the tube, a span called the Forever Bridge that stretches across the voil to where the caravan master waits for your return.

Except for Iom, you're all in bad shape. Marit is hacking her lungs up, and you and Ushrov are starting to sniffle - and to make matters worse, the Forever Bridge is toying with you. Every time you start across it, you find yourself walking back toward the cave. You can't reach the other side. 

Finally, after a third attempt, Marit collapses, barely conscious, and Ushrov turns on Iom. "You've still got the Embrace, don't you, you bastard? You're killing us all!"

Iom nods. "I have a right to life too."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looking past the corpse of the creature, you see something peeking out from under a pile of rubbish. You cross to it and pick it up. It's a flat brass disk with a winking pink light in the middle - a glue cypher. You pocket it, then turn to the others, who are recovering. 

"Please, V." Marit coughs, her face bloodied by the rocks. There's a thin film of black on her hand as she pulls it away from her mouth. "That was the last straw. This expedition's cursed. Let's get of here."

Ushrov shakes his head. "I won't go back. I made a promise. Let's just make camp and patch ourselves up, then continue on in the morning."</DefaultText>

You continue up, followed by the sounds of Marit's wailing tears and hacking coughs.

Ushrov is staring below you. "You made the right decision, I guess, but what about the Harrows? Who's going to-" A coughing fit takes him.

The Voil fades to red mist below you. The last thing you see as you are wrenched out of the Mere is Ushrov staring, wide-eyed at his hand. It's covered in a black film.
