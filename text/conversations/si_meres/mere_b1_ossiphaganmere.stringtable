      <DefaultText>You are on the spine of a great, dead monster buried in the lava. Rib-like towers jut out of the ground all around you. A transport floats next to the top of one tower.

Two landmarks are visible in the distance: massive obsidian formations and a carved mountain pass beyond a field of glowing lights.

      <DefaultText>You are in the body of Zerian Daywalker, a jack who can speak with the dead. Indeed, now that you remember that, you can *feel* the dead all around you. You can hear them. It takes little effort to *know* the stories of those who died here. You may even be able to imbue some of your life force into their corpses.

Zerian is wearing a black, form-fitting suit that keeps off the worst of the heat. He carries a whip and various necromantic ornaments.

Zerian was on a task for someone called the Chimaera. He was sent here to find some kind of sphere.

Zerian is wearing a black, form-fitting suit that keeps off the worst of the heat. He carries a whip and various ornaments that remind you of the dead.

Seeing the ornaments, you realize they're not just decorative. You can *feel* the dead around you, as well as the stories of those who died here. Zerian must have had some strange connection beyond the world of the living. Perhaps that has something to do with why he was sent on this mission.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are in a place called the fields of Ossiphagan, and many have lived and died here, though it seems a terrible place to live.

Scavengers from Sagus Cliffs have been through here in recent centuries, seeking treasures of the past. Before that, it was mutants fleeing revolution after bloody revolution in a place called Haref. Before that, refugees from a village called Shuenha.

Before that, the Ossiphagans themselves.

You see a glimmer of a powerful artifact. Hundreds of years ago, there was a battle here. Many died. Two people - a middle-aged woman and a teenaged girl - fought over a copper sphere at the top of the glowing bone tower.

      <DefaultText>You are at the top of the broken bone tower. Jagged bone walls act as a kind of parapet.

From here you can see the fields of Ossiphagan even better: the spine below you, the obsidian formations in one direction, and the glowing fields in front of the mountain pass in the other.

Floating just next to the tower is a hovering pod made of azure steel. A ramp leads from the parapet into the transport.

      <DefaultText>Little has happened here, but for one event that immediately becomes apparent. You see a middle-aged woman - you know her name is Ama - facing off against a young girl named Thiya. Ama is hovering in the air, like the transport does now. She holds a copper sphere that glows with a golden light.

Angry words are exchanged, and suddenly Thiya leaps off the tower and tackles Ama. The two of them soar through the air toward the obsidian formations in the distance.

      <DefaultText>You step aboard. The transport does not appear to have been made with adult humans in mind. There is only room enough for you to lay down, and even then you have to roll on your side and bend in your legs slightly. As soon as you have done so, the ramp recedes and the doorway disappears. Your stomach lurches as the transport takes to the sky.

At first you try to peer out of the tiny portholes, but all you see is pitch black - presumably the volcanoes' black clouds. Eventually, they are replaced by the black of a starry sky. You try to see the land below, but it's impossible in the cramped space.

Hours pass. Finally the transport slows. Its humming ceases, and the door reappears.

      <DefaultText>You step out of the transport, stretching painfully. You are in a strange cavern. Artifacts are strewn everywhere, in various stages of repair or experimentation. One wall is covered by a network of displays, showing people and scenes that mean nothing to you.

In the center of the room is an enormous cage made from steel tendrils that twist together at the top. The cage glows for a moment, and a figure walks out. He wears a thick cloak, but his face is most strange. It shifts and blurs, changing its features constantly. You get the impression you are seeing a person, but you can't define what that person looks like at all.

His name comes to your mind immediately: the Chimaera.

      <DefaultText>Crossing the volcanic plains, you arrive at the obsidian formations. Massive structures of cooled, shining rock leap from the ground, curling into impossible shapes. An enormous black wall rings most of the formations, rising a hundred meters out of the ground in places.

The obsidian formations are dark, quiet, and desolate. A hot wind blows from magma flows farther off, but here nothing flows and nothing lives.

In the distance, you can see the spine and bone towers, and in the other direction the plains stop at a sheer cliff face with a mountain pass carved in between.

      <DefaultText>The obsidian formations did not form naturally. Creatures made of pure light, called fire wights, formed these structures out of hot, flowing magma, then super-cooled them into the shapes they are in now.

The wights were trying to get at something, or someone. You see a pair of figures atop a small flying platform. One of them holds a copper sphere that glows with a golden light. The wights tried to trap them here with their wall, but they escaped and flew toward the mountain pass.

You can feel the gemorrn's rage like a hand pressing against your back. It presses harder, squeezing your mind. The gemorrn's howl makes the ground tremble.

Suddenly the pressure releases, and the air turns burning cold. You risk a glance behind you and realize you are in the center of the plains leading to the mountain pass, surrounded by fire wights. The gemorrn grabs wights one at a time, tearing them in two then tossing them aside. The wights rush forward together to defend themselves against the horrible beast.

In their anger, you are forgotten and ignored.

You know these creatures are called fire wights. At the moment, they seem to be ignoring you.

You can see the spot where the shield fell, and though the bodies are no longer there, you can *feel* their presence very strongly.

And there, a short distance away, you can see where one of the figures dropped what looks like a copper sphere.

      <DefaultText>The whip has no more effect than it does on the air itself. Several wights turn toward you at the sudden intrusion. The air around you ripples between hot and cold so quickly it makes you feel sick.

Three of the wights reach out to you and begin sliding closer.

      <DefaultText>As the whip passes through the wight, it grows chilly in your hand. Ice crystallizes on the far end, which falls to the ground with a thud.

Then the wights pounce on you with surprising speed. Three of their hands push *into* you, and a terrible pain stretches through your chest into your entire body. Within seconds, you are too weak to even run.

"Peace," says Ama. "Is it better? Better, yes. Better oblivion."

As you walk toward the sphere, however, their attention changes. One moves to block your way. When you try to feint around it, three more appear behind you. The closer you get to the sphere, the more of their attention you gain. No matter what you try, you can't close the distance to the sphere without several of them blocking or even surrounding you.

Strangely, when you walk away from the fields and the sphere, the wights seem to quickly lose interest in you, like they are protecting it.</DefaultText>

You command her to collect the sphere, but Ama's body only makes it a short way before the wights attack her. Their hands reach inside of her, consuming what little life force you imbued her with. As they do so, the air grows intensely cold.

The sphere is about three hundred meters away, and the wights shift  around constantly. It's going to be tricky to get close.

The Chimaera turns and slides a hand along one of the metal tendrils. Although no discernible interface appears, he presses his finger against the metal twice and the cage begins to glow.

One of his eye sockets is artificial, alternately projecting a human eye, a snake's eye, and something even more alien in the time he looks you over. He looks like a shipwreck survivor: bare-chested, ragged pants, ragged beard. If so, he's better fed than you'd expect.

"Zerian?" he says, his human eye squinting in the light. "What the hells do *you* want?" He peers forward, as though trying to see into the cavern.

      <DefaultText>When you first open your eyes, there's only a ruddy glow and frightening shapes in shadows around you. The air is hot and stifling.

As your eyes adjust, you realize you're outside, but the sky is darkened by clouds of pitch. The ruddy glow comes from lava flows as they trundle down distant mountains into the volcanic fields all around you.

Sharp towers pierce the sky, tapered like the bones of a rib cage. Indeed, they look like bones in every way, as does the ground beneath you. You appear to be standing on the spine of an enormous beast - the bottom of its jaw can be seen far in the distance, half-buried beneath a layer of cooled lava.

      <DefaultText>Most of the bone towers look identical, but one shines from the inside with an odd, blue light. The top of the glowing tower has been snapped off, and what looks like a transport hovers next to its peak. It's *your* transport. You were sent here to find something...

Twisted bridges connect the spine to the volcanic fields around you. In one direction lie enormous formations of obsidian: arches, spires, a wall. In the other direction a narrow pass is carved into the mountain face. The field leading to the canyon is illuminated by hundreds of glowing lights.

You know this body wasn't sent to find Mazzof, but Aadiriis said he'd appear. Perhaps following through events will lead to him.</DefaultText>

Suddenly you are blinded by a bright flash of light. You shield your eyes, preparing for a counterattack, but none comes. When you can see again, the Chimaera is gone.

When you look at each circle, a different image appears in your mind of a person or a place. You look at each circle again and again until a memory stirs and you know which one is Mazzof.

Pressing that circle activates the cage, and you step inside.

You command her to collect the sphere. The wights are preoccupied with the gemorrn, and so Ama's body reaches the sphere easily and returns it to you. Then the corpse collapses.
