      <DefaultText>Red. It's the color of the sky as the sun sets behind the stacked hovels. It's the color of the dust that coats the massive obelisk rising beyond the hovels, holding back the endless waters of the Oasis.

It's the color of her skin. The woman's name is Sucya. Her skin turns red when she's afraid. A mutation.

Red is the color of her blood, running from the gash in her forehead. Red is your rage as you look at the two men who tower over her, laughing raucously, taking turns to vent their spite.

You can smell it, the blood *and* their loathing. It stinks worse than Sucya's fear.

"Please!" Sucya begs you. "Please stop them! Help me!" {SOUND: Two men beating up a woman. Woman crying for help.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Human rights, mutie," one of them jeers. "There ain't enough water to go around, but this trawl spoor thinks she deserves more than the rest of us."

Sucya starts to protest that it wasn't her, but the human kicks her in the face.

"You all do it!" He spits in her face. "Don't think we ain't seen every one of you taking more than your daily cup. That should be enough for any filthy mutant, but no, now you got the Burgrave thinking about changing the damn laws!" He kicks her again to make his point.

The other one steps forward and looks down at you, blocking the sun. "I bet you deserve as much as a human too, don't ya? Think you're better than the rest of us?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With their backs turned to you, it's easy to kick one in the kidney and knock him down. The other one turns on you with a scowl, and knocks you down with his first punch.

You get up and tackle him in the gut, landing a fist against his chin to quiet him.

The other tackles you from behind, beating your kidneys. Finally, you spin around and knock him off. He lands flat on his back. You jump on top of him, pummeling him until he's cowering instead of fighting back. As he gets up, you give him one last kick in the ribs.

"Damn mutants!" one says. "You don't belong here. We'll be back with the others. *Then* we'll teach you a lesson!" They scurry away.

      <DefaultText>The humans laugh at your pathetic attempt. They turn on you, overwhelming you from both sides. You can't protect every place at once. They pound your face, your stomach, your kidneys.

You taste blood and smell your own fear. They knock you down, and all you see is the red sky behind their sneering faces.

They stop at last. One of them spits on your face. "Damn mutants," he says. "You don't belong here. We'll be back later with the others. Then we'll teach you a *real* lesson."

They strut back down the road into town.

      <DefaultText>They turn to snap something back at you, but when they see their own hate reflected back in your eyes, they hesitate.

"Forget it, Luds," says one. "They ain't worth the trouble."

As they walk past you, the one called Luds spits in your face. "Damn mutants. You don't belong here! We'll be back with the others. *Then* we'll teach you a lesson."

      <DefaultText>They turn to snap something back at you, but when they see their own hate reflected back in your eyes - and the eyes of dozens of mutants surrounding them - they hesitate.

"Forget it, Luds," says one. "They ain't worth the trouble."

As they walk past you, the one called Luds looks like he's about to spit, then thinks better of it. From a safe distance, he says, "Damn mutants. You don't belong here! We'll be back with the others. *Then* we'll teach you a lesson."

      <DefaultText>They hit Sucya one more time, then stop, breathing heavy. One of them mutters something to the other and they both back down.

The other looks up at the darkening sky. "Getting dark," he says. He turns and leers. "Grotto's a dangerous place at night. Who knows who could get hurt?"

They turn to leave. As they walk past you, one of them spits in your face. "Watch your back, mutie. Next time it won't be just two of us in broad daylight."

      <DefaultText>One of the men grabs the wrist of the other just as he's about to hit Sucya again. "Bastard's right, Luds. We could get in trouble for this."

Breathing heavy, Luds backs down. He looks up at the darkening sky. "Right now we could, maybe." He turns and leers at you. "But the Grotto's a dangerous place. Who knows who could get hurt at night?"

They turn to leave. As they walk past you, Luds spits in your face. "Watch your back, mutie. Next time it won't be just two of us in broad daylight."

      <DefaultText>After they leave, a chiurgeon runs forward to attend Sucya's wounds. A small boy covered in blood blisters comes out from his hiding place to watch. An enormous mutant with an elongated neck towers over both of them.

A woman with blue skin runs out from her house. "Ashe!" she shouts at the boy. "You get home this instant."

The boy tears himself away from Sucya and the chiurgeon. Suddenly, he stops and looks up to you. "They said they were coming back? What are we gonna do?"

His mother Lali puts a hand on the boy's shoulder and also looks to you. "What *are* we going to do?"

You feel the heat of several dozen eyes asking the same thing, looking to you for guidance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stand back and watch while the two of them beat Sucya bloody. Her skin fades from red to yellow to purple - but the purple isn't a part of her mutation. She no longer smells of fear. She smells of death.

After a long time, the two men spit on her and then leave. They leer at the other mutants on their way out, daring them to do something, but none do.

One of them puts a hand on your shoulder. "We'll be back, mutie. Gotta keep cleaning up till all the filth is gone, yeah?"

He shoves you out of the way, and then they're gone.

      <DefaultText>"We should fight!" The boy Ashe grins with sharp, yellow teeth. "There are lots of us. We can take them!"

"Hush, child." His mother taps him lightly on the back of his head. A blood blister pops, covering her hand with a sticky, smelly goo. "Damn. Anyway, don't listen to him. We're not fighters, you know that."

The woman Lali looks over to where the chiurgeon is ministering to Sucya. "You shouldn't ask me what I think. I think we should just keep our heads down, but that won't stop this, will it? I wonder if anything can."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>All three of Misha's hands are busy, fussing over Sucya with several different pastes, injectors, and spray canisters.

"Can't take much more of this," she mutters. "I mean all of us. Seems like someone comes in here causing trouble every week now. As if life in the Morphling Grotto weren't hard enough."

She slams three cyphers down at once and glowers at you. "What we *should* do is talk to the Burgrave. He might actually be able to do something."

She returns to Sucya with a groan. "Not that he would. Not that any of us could even get to him without trouble. But it might be the only chance we have."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This mutant stands two meters tall *without* his long neck. His hands look strong enough to rip bricks in half. It's a wonder he didn't do anything to help Sucya, when he clearly could have.

His voice, when it comes, is strange and sonorous, emerging from the multiple holes pierced through his neck. "Zel will not feast until blood has come to reign," he says, and you realize he's talking about himself, not that he makes any sense.

He looks directly at you. "Zel desires blood to reign."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zel's long neck undulates. "Blood," he intones. The muscles on his enormous frame ripple with barely contained rage. "It is the way."

The others look at each other uneasily. Sucya grimaces but nods. "He's right. They've given us no choice."

Misha, the chiurgeon, produces a number of implements that would serve as weapons. Blushing, Lali teaches the others a few things her husband had taught her before he died. Ashe spends the night running around slashing imaginary bad guys.

By the third chorus, the entire Grotto is singing with fists raised. Others begin painting, fantastic murals that glow and seem to come to life in the dim light.

Misha pulls instruments from her chiurgeon's bag. "These might serve as weapons," she says, "though I hate to see their use so perverted."

Even Lali demonstrates a few fighting moves her husband had taught her before he died, and Ashe spends the night running around slashing imaginary bad guys.

The aria builds to a crescendo of joy, until even young Ashe is dancing around the Grotto, singing at the top of his lungs. The light in his eyes is contagious. His mother laughs, and soon the entire Grotto is laughing or smiling with a joy they have no reason to feel... and every reason to need.

      <DefaultText>You follow the path the thugs took to leave the Grotto. It leads you away from the towering obelisk down a winding road shadowed by tall sandstone buildings on either side.

The closer you get to the main town, the more humans there are. Every one of them stares at you. Some turn away quickly, feigning nonchalance. Others curl their lips in disgust. A few tell you to go back where you came from - the waste, preferably. One warns you you'll die out here, but the way he says it seems like he hopes he's the one who kills you.

In the town square, you are shoved and jostled on all sides. What few kind faces there are steer clear of you entirely.

Finally, you reach the Burgrave's tower. {SOUND: Busy city street. Ideally the occasional jeer from the crowd.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There are very few people on the streets outside the Grotto at this time of night. Suddenly a few figures emerge from the shadows. Two of them are the humans from before. "Well, now," one says, leering, "what are you doing out?"

      <DefaultText>You pretend to attack them, then juke the other way and run past. You tear down the alley, their footsteps in hot pursuit.

Misha sees you first. She shouts to the others, and they prepare for a fight. She gives you a makeshift club, and you turn to face your adversaries.

But this is worse than before. It's not just the two thugs beating up Sucya, but an entire *gang* of humans, come to take their anger out on the mutants of the Grotto once and for all.

The fighting begins faster than you expect. The air is filled with shouts of rage and pain. With a tremendous *whack*, you knock down the man in front of you, but looking around you see everyone is in danger.

In reply, one of the thugs knocks her down - the crack is audible all around the Grotto. She falls, and the others falter. As the humans bear down on them, they look to you for guidance.

The pain is in your ribs, your side, your neck. "Good" was the wrong word, but it is endurable. After a time, it feels like the pain is happening to someone else.

Quicker than you expected, it's over. You feel saliva on your cheek, and then open your eyes. The thugs are walking away, almost disgusted at themselves. Almost.

"Hey." It's Ashe, his hand on your shoulder. Ugly bruises color his skin, but he's alive. "You were right," he says. "We *are* stronger."

Soon the entire Grotto is singing of the women who endured the loss of her family - even from their doors and windows. They sing for each other. They even sing for the thugs.

And quicker than you expected, it's over. You feel saliva on your cheek, and then the thugs are walking away, disgusted. Will they return? They might, but when they do, the mutants of the Grotto will be strong enough to face them.

Misha snaps. She grabs the arm of the thug above her and punches him in the crotch. The others cheer, and before you can stop them, the Grotto is no longer enduring, but fighting back. Their emotions have given them courage, but not of the quiet kind.

Soon the air is filled with shouts of rage and pain. You don't remember picking up a board, but with a tremendous *whack*, you knock down one of the thugs with it.

Looking around, though, you see everyone is in danger.

He looks like he can take care of himself, until the humans coordinate their attacks and overwhelm him. Four men jump on him at once, pinning him down, while a fifth runs forward with a razor-sharp verred.

You get to Zel just in time, cracking the man with the verred across the jaw. He doesn't get up. You knock down two more before they realize what happened and turn on you, but by then Zel is able to grab them and smash their heads together like eggs.

He stands to his full height and grabs your forearm. "Blood," he intones. "You consume one. Zel consumes another."

Then he leaps back into the fray.

Something slams into your back then. Before you can turn to face your attacker, another blow smashes your head into the dirt. Life seeps from your skull. Some distance away, you see Zel lying dead on the ground as well, dozens torn apart beside him.

The world fades to blackness. You hear the fighting spread - a full riot. All of Jerboa has joined one side or the other.

"You should never have gone," says Misha. "Maybe then, Zel might have lived."

      <DefaultText>It's no use. The Grotto is overrun. Panicked mutants bolt in every direction, unable to find an escape. They trip over each other, knocking each other down in their terror.

You only manage a few steps before something slams into your back. Before you can tell whether it was a human or a fellow mutant who struck you, another blow smashes your head into the dirt.

You feel the life seeping from your skull. Other mutants cower on the ground as humans beat them senseless. The ground has become red with their blood, and one or two lie on the ground like you, their dead eyes staring into yours forever.

But the Grotto is in terror. Panicked mutants bolt in every direction, unable to find an escape. They trip over each other, knocking each other down in their terror.

You face a new attacker when something slams into your back. Before you can tell whether it was a human or a fellow mutant who struck you, another blow smashes your head into the dirt.

The chiurgeon injects something into her neck. Finally, her eyes flutter open and find you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tower marks the center of the town square. It is clearly not of the Ninth World. It is made of some older material, tipping so much it's a wonder it hasn't collapsed yet.

The Burgrave is easy to find. He stands in front of the tower, a stout man in a colorful robe - more colorful than most Jerboan citizens. His robe is adorned with various pearlescent beads and discs that mark his station.

He 's speaking with a richly dressed man and woman. The Burgrave does not seem to have noticed you, but the couple he is speaking to are clearly disgusted by your arrival.

      <DefaultText>The Burgrave gives you his sudden attention. "Oh!" he says. "I was so engrossed in what I was doing..." He looks you up and down, though not in the disgusted way his fellows do. "What brings a mutant out here?"

You state your case, telling him of the attack on Sucya and all that came after, including their warning that they would return. The couple leaves, but he listens, waiting patiently for you to finish the whole tale.

"It must be of great importance to you," he says, "for you to come here and even interrupt three of Jerboa's most important officials. Very well, I will have it investigated. After all, the Grotto is part of the city, too."

You thank him and return home.</DefaultText>

Finally they leave. The Burgrave turns to you, apparently surprised to find you standing there. "What brings a mutant out here?"
