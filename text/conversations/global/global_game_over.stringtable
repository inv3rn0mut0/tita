She largely avoided the mistakes of the Changing God, and she honored the sacrifices of her siblings by mending the damage they had done... and helping, whenever possible, the ones they had left behind. 

But the First was no perfect being, no goddess, and she made mistakes of her own. Mistakes that rippled out into the world, causing new havoc, new heartache - and much of it, her own. But that is another story.</DefaultText>

Meanwhile, the castoffs - mortal, yet still very long-lived - carried on as they always had, bickering, fighting, and hiding, in a vast and ever-growing shadow. As the decades passed, they felt the Tides stir and strengthen. They turned their attentions from each other and guarded their lives like precious treasure, walling themselves off from the world, increasingly terrified that their hunter might someday return...</DefaultText>

He found it at last, and his colleague told him the truth - the tattoos that Aligern had regarded as a curse were the transformed villagers of Ormen, their data carried in biological light and transplanted into his skin.

Aligern discovered how he might free his family and friends from the cursed tattoos. Some of the villagers suffered permanent damage, and Aligern devoted his remaining days to caring for those he had harmed. He refused to deal with the numenera again.

He was buried in Ormen. They scratched his name on the wall of the Valley of Dead Heroes.</DefaultText>

Ten years passed. The Bloom turned against her, as it had against all the previous rulers. She decided to run. She almost made it to M'ra Jolios when an enormous Maw swallowed both her and the sands around her.

Upon taking the role of the Memovira, she declared a new era in the Bloom. Ever the cynic, she trusted no one. She kept her lieutenants focused on each other, and she encouraged their rivalries.

Ten years passed. The Bloom turned against her, as it had against all the previous rulers. She decided to run and almost made it to M'ra Jolios.

Almost.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina claimed the Bloom, but only long enough to restore control. She remembered its appetite, and she wanted to make a new start, to cast aside the mantle of the White Death. 

She journeyed to Kholn Village. Some castoffs followed her in time, though none congregated for long - the threat of the Sorrow was too great. Ordinary humans came too, and Matkina discovered she had lost her taste for solitude. She welcomed their company. 

She helped them build, resolved their disputes with confidence and care. She became a leader, without a single drop of blood spilled.

Ten years passed. One morning, Matkina did not emerge from her home. Inside, a new Maw stretched wide.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matkina claimed the Bloom, but only long enough to restore control. She wanted to shed the mantle of the White Death. She went to the Cult of the Changing God to talk about the histories of her siblings. She remained with them for a year, telling them what she knew of the fate of her sire. Some of the cult quit in rage and grief. Others followed her back to Kholn Village.

They built a monument to her fallen creator, and a small community accreted around her. To her surprise, she found she was a natural leader, and the town of Kholn Village began to grow. Castoffs came and went. For a time, she knew peace. 

When the Sorrow came for her decades later, she greeted it as a friend.  </DefaultText>

Together, she and the other castoffs built a monument to their fallen creator. They tried to create a new community, none harder than Matkina, who had discovered a talent for leadership.

But castoffs are fractious and quarrelsome. After a century of leadership, one of her foes planted a singularity detonation in her bed, obliterating her.

To commemorate her efforts, the castoffs carved a remembrance in the stone walls of the village.

That was eventually destroyed too.</DefaultText>

She consolidated power quickly, ruthlessly, ensuring that anyone who challenged her died horrifically.
 
She declared a new era in the Bloom. Ever the cynic, she trusted no one. Castoff siblings sought her favor, to use the trade routes she controlled... and she repaid them by feeding them to the Bloom. At last they left her alone.

      <DefaultText>Seeking a way to atone for his part in the death of Auvigne, Tybir left Sagus and the Bloom in the company of a band of mercenaries with a noble reputation. Well, nobler than most. 

Eventually, he saved enough to fund a mercenary band of his own. Comprised of idealists, selfless lunatics, poets, prostitutes, and wealthy runaways, Tybir and his tribe of Penniless Sellswords roved about the land for many, many years, protecting the innocent by picking suicidal fights with tyrants and bandits alike, all in the name of protecting the innocent.

To his surprise, he found that the villagers were still there - the noble that had tried to drive them away had been killed by a large, masked man many years ago. 

To his credit, Tybir did not lie to them. He told them who he was, and what he had done. And he swore to protect them until the end of his days. 

He did, and the villagers forgave him in time. Later, they respected him. And when he died in his sleep decades later, they mourned him as one of their own.</DefaultText>

One day, he simply disappeared. No one cared enough about him to wonder whether the Bloom had claimed him or one of his former enemies. No one loved him enough to go looking for him. 

Naturally, he was never seen again.</DefaultText>

But they no longer did. Desperate to forget his failures, he buried himself in pleasure and took dangerous - and despicable - jobs to support his extravagant lifestyle. 

Near the end, he had no less than five contracts on his head - but the levies found him first. Guilty of crimes that would have once made him shudder, Tybir at last found himself before a jeering crowd and the executioner he had once feared: Death-of-Tybir.</DefaultText>

A week later, a traveler found an unremarkable, straw-haired stranger lying dead in the road. He did not have a single wound. A single golden fleck marked the corner of his mouth. 

Light-footed bootprints - the corpse's feet were clean and bare, the traveler noticed - wound away down the road. In the direction of the sunrise. </DefaultText>

But what mattered was that he tried. That in some rare cases, he found someone who *actually* needed help, and saved them as a hero does: just in time. 

Eventually, his exertions took their toll. He fell ill on the road, then collapsed. Erritis died miles from anywhere, alone, but with a satisfied smile on his face.

But in a nameless field not far from the Valley of Dead Heroes, an aging herdsman drove his newly-bought yol towards a run-down hut. Humming to himself, he rebuilt the hut stone by stone. That night, he slept better than he had in years. 

He lived out his many years as a stranger to everyone who saw him in the tiny town where he bought his supplies. And one day, a shopkeeper realized he hadn't seen the herdsman in months.

Collapsed. Months and months of unending adventure had taken their toll on the Hero. Erritis died in a nameless field not far from where he had begun his mad and frantic quest. And the voices within him went dormant. Quiet.

Rhin spent the night with the other refugees outside the Memovira's fortress and returned the next day. She returned every day. She sought out people the Maw might feed on. She even considered asking for a slave once, but she couldn't make herself do it.

One day, Aen-tozon... disappeared. Some said he was swallowed by the Bloom. Others said he had swallowed himself somehow. Most agreed he had met a bad end, as most do in the Bloom.

She took care of herself on the streets. It wasn't until her mid-twenties that she became a toymaker - one who brought joy to the young hearts of Sagus Cliffs, and young hearts to the old.

The Fifth Eye faced a menace of its own, however. An Adversary - that ancient foe of the psychic veterans - had hidden itself there, watching and waiting. When it was strong enough, it emerged, suddenly and without warning.

The Adversary devoured the minds of those in the Fifth Eye, then it rampaged across the Sagus Protectorate, unchallenged and free.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Poor Tarnish spent the next several decades trying to regenerate the crippled foreman, after it gave its life for its children. Seeing Tarnish's love for the construct, the other two foremen grew more sympathetic and tried to help. But even they could not restore the construct's life - the life it had given to its children.

Tarnish passed away an old man, and the project - the empty construct - was left abandoned.</DefaultText>

Finally, the master foreman called for his workers to bring the small constructs in to him. He was surprised at how much they had grown. Apparently, they had been building themselves as well as random pieces of the city.

He now instructs them, treating them as he does his human workers - although it is clear he favors them more. What's unclear is how well they will continue to follow his instructions.</DefaultText>

Soon after his ninety-first birthday, they were successful....</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the sticha's eggs safely in the care of the city, the quakes beneath Sagus Cliffs ceased for many years. Indeed, it had been so long that Peliai often considered selling the rest of the eggs for herself.

One night, the inhabitants of Government Square were woken by a thunderous crash that shook even the strongest buildings. Bleary-eyed, they came out of their homes to see what had happened.

Peliai's home was gone, and Peliai with it. In its place was an enormous sinkhole that seemed to stretch down beneath the level of the ocean itself.

      <DefaultText>The Bloom was relatively quiet for days after the Sorrow's attack on the Memovira's Fortress. Nearly all of the Memovira's soldiers had fled, and the rest of the Bloom's denizens waited quietly, wondering what would happen.

When the Memovira did not return, and nobody rose up to take her place... that's when the fighting began. It started with the mutants of Little Nihliesh, but soon every faction was involved. The Bloom became a deadly battleground - one the Bloom itself seemed to encourage, engorging itself on the lust of its denizens.

Brusca harbored a small contingent of civilians inside the fortress, hoping that the violence would die down.
