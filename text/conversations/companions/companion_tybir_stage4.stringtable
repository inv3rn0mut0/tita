He coughs. "Well, those are the stories I tell to people I'm planning to trick, and... No, let's call them what they really are, shall we? Those are the *lies* I tell to people I'm planning to trick, and believe me, I've been planning to trick you from the beginning. But... well, somewhere along the way, I changed my mind, and now... Now I don't know what to say."

      <DefaultText>He gets a far away look in his eye. "Well now, many masters, over the years. My first commission was with the cattle men of the Plowshares. Trying to keep the Slave Families of the Sagus Protectorate from getting their multitudinous fingers on the Bherd folks' grazing land."

He shrugs. "But I've humped my pack all over the map, and off the edges too. Even fought in the Endless Battle for a while, until I figured out that the cause I thought I was fighting for was a lie. Walked away from a hefty purse on that one, I'll tell you. But it was the right thing to do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm sure I'll bore you to tears, but if you insist." He strokes his mustashes, thinking back. "We were holed up in a little herd town at the far eastern end of the Plowshares. There'd been a battle in the grazing just north of it, and the Protectorate had handed us our collective posteriors."

"Well, the herdfolk there, they were doing all they could for us - feeding us, binding our wounds - because, well, we'd been defending their town, hadn't we? Trying to, at any rate. But what they didn't know was that the Protectorate had also stolen all their aneen for provisions - the whole herd - and was headed south with 'em." He sighs. "Come winter, those folk were going to starve to death."</DefaultText>

He clears his throat. "Right, then. Here's a bit of comedy for you. I was hired as a bodyguard by a woman who claimed she was Navarene nobility, visiting Sagus Cliffs on some sort of trade mission. Wanted me to escort her to a ball and make sure she got back to her inn after. Easy job. Done the same sort of thing a hundred times. And I thought there might be some *undercover* work afterwards, if you mark me, for she was a beauty, and kept squeezing my arm."</DefaultText>

He frowns. "It was more like a dream than a war. Or rather a nightmare. We would march out in the morning, with our captain saying we had to take such and such a hill, and we'd take it, and then a ripple of time would cross the battle field and we'd be back in the same morning, heading for the same hill, only this time we wouldn't take it, until the next time wave crossed our path, and we'd won it again.

      <DefaultText>He shifts, uncomfortable. "My commander wasn't going to tell 'em. We'd lost all our supplies, and needed every bit of forage the town could give us. I couldn't stand it. We were meant to be the saving of these people, and here we were robbing them just as surely as the Protectorate had."

"So that night, me and two of my mates "borrowed" three Rasters and a sonic punch from the fly boys and flew south until we found the Saggies and the stolen aneen. We scream-dived the herd until they bolted, then chased 'em all the way back north." He shakes his head. "Fools we were. Nearly got knocked out of the sky a dozen times by the Saggies' shakers, but we were sure that, once we got the aneen away, they wouldn't dare turn back for them. They knew we were being reinforced the next morning, you see."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then, halfway through the party, she excuses herself for a few moments, and when she comes back she's changed her clothes!" 

He chuckles, though there's no humor in it. "So, she puts her lips to my ear and whispers, "We must go, and if you value your life and my honor, you will say to anyone who asks that you are my husband, Baron Ghyusk, of Navarene." And she adds that I will be *richly* rewarded, all the while pressing herself against me like a Nibovian Wife."

And right on cue, they ask me who I am, and I am such a terrible liar that it comes out, "I am Baron Nykusk of Gavralene and this is my knife."

He shakes his head. "Thirty days in the blocks as an accessory. Turns out she'd pinched a fortune in living gems. Just a common thief. Though a mighty handsome one, I must say."</DefaultText>

Beautiful boys, delectable girls, so I signed up on the spot."

He spits on the ground, disgusted. "Nothing to do with Walskar. Nowhere near the place. Left as soon as I could, though it took traveling through a few realities to do it."</DefaultText>

"Well, the herdfolk there, they were doing all they could for us - feeding us, binding our wounds - because, well, we'd been defending their town, hadn't we? Trying to, at any rate.

      <DefaultText>"So I waited until he was away on a supply run, and turned our mercenaries on the village Auvvie had sworn to protect." He chuckles through his tears. "That did it. One look at the soldiers shoving children into the street, and Auvvie bashed me in the jaw and said we were done."

      <DefaultText>"I loved him," he says, gripping his head with bloodless fingers. "More than I loved myself, and I'd felt him die dozens of times in the Endless Battle. I wanted him out of my head, understand? I wanted him gone, so that when death took him for the last time, I wouldn't feel it." His sigh is a soft, ragged thing.

      <DefaultText>"No," Tybir says bitterly. "He should have killed me. If he had, he might still be alive." His sigh is a soft, ragged thing.

      <DefaultText>He straightens, adjusting his clothing, and gives you a weary smile. "Sometimes, you feel like a day should end when you've borne too much. But it doesn't, and you have to keep going, don't you?"

Tybir takes a deep breath. "Give me some time to myself, will you? I've had enough of talk for now, being honest." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tears streak down his cheeks, unheeded. "Here's the truth about what separated us - I was afraid to lose him, so I broke his heart. Cheated on him, and used my ring to make sure he knew. And it didn't work. He still loved me, and he didn't understand why I was pushing him away."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He paces over a small patch of ground as though caged. "I knew he was here, and that he was looking for me. I should have..."

He trails off, and pulls the ring Dracogen gave him from his pocket. He cradles it in his palm, and meets your eyes. 

"Heartbeat," he says. "They work by skin contact, see. I'd know if he was..." He bites his lip, and closes his fingers over the ring.  </DefaultText>
