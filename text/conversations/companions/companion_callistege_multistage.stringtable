      <DefaultText>"Why, here." She holds out her hands and completes a graceful turn. "The walls of Sagus were my cage until, like a bird, I took flight. Figuratively, you understand. I speak of knowledge, not mere physical movement. I grew beyond the grand library in short order and was soon writing texts for it myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They are me! We are a part of each other, sisters across infinite realities. We share our experiences... and power. What's that old saying? That experience brings wisdom? I must be the wisest person in Sagus Cliffs... the wisest across countless worlds!" Her laughter peals out.</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>The look in her eyes sharpens, hardens. "That is not a tale worth telling. Or not here, at any rate. The man has friends in this city yet, and we both have our reasons for wanting to conceal the past. I advise you to let it rest." You catch a flash of green from beneath her eyelashes as she lowers her head demurely. "For now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, everything." She seems surprised by your question. "Everything I could get my hands on. The skies, the earth, the water, the secrets of life itself." She smiles fondly at a memory she chooses not to share. "Then one day I came across a theory of alternate worlds. Not merely those that came before, but those that exist now, and which continue to exist. I rather think your sire may have had something to do with it. Needless to say, it became my main point of study."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Everything. But I was drawn to the idea of alternate worlds more than any other - informed in particular by the works of your sire - and it made me the person I am today."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, you know. This and that. Lady raised in high society becomes renowned intellectual, goes on to  humiliate her peers, et cetera." She glances at you, as if gauging your interest. "Of course, I am exceptional, but my story is less so. It would bore you to tears, no doubt."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You have your charms, and they're a fair few more than most.  I suppose I could say I enjoy your company, but we're beyond such trivial panderings, of course."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>

"Aligern and I met when he came to the Order of Truth, seeking help. Naturally, I was intrigued by his predicament. More so than the man." She smiles, but absently.

She rolls her eyes, arm thrown dramatically across her forehead. "This pitiful, childlike snuffling when he thought I was asleep." She shakes her head in disbelief.

"His family was gone. There was no more he could tell me, and I had learned nothing worth telling him. You saw the end. I've moved on."</DefaultText>

"Does one ever 'deserve' violence? Or kindness? One can merit it, perhaps, or court it, to be sure, but there is no question of deserving. Even my test subjects knew that. The vagaries of the universe are rarely so personal as certain people would like to believe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs. "Dear child, what problems couldn't be solved by gaining the knowledge of a thousand worlds? Why, I can think of none!" There is a brittle edge to her laughter, a little too loud, a little too obvious. The people around her pay no notice while, she, it seems, pays much attention to them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs.

"When I was younger... *much* younger, if you can believe such a time existed, I spent my days hunting down dangerous numenera that no one else would touch. Devices that could obliterate rock and flesh alike, swarms of stronglass insects that would inject an explosive poison into all who came near, mysteries of that nature. Naturally, it attracted a certain type of person." A smile quirks her mouth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"At that moment, other echoes of myself had accomplished the same thing. The quantum differences in our lives shivered and magnified. We became aware of each other. Some of us... some of across the spectrum were driven mad. Others took their own lives. *I* remained strong. These sisters you see around me did as well."

She pauses. "The flood of information can be quite overwhelming. Thus it is that I seek a way to manage these inputs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She smiles gently. "Such curiosity! Very well. Let me indulge you." She clears her throat. "Some prior world or worlds seeded the atmosphere and near-space with a vast network of computational and informational devices. I believe the ancients used this network to communicate with each other at great distances, and perhaps across space and through dimensions. It is this latter application that especially interests me... as you might imagine."</DefaultText>

She smiles thinly. "You see? Even in my thoughts we are not alone. We seek - let us call it closure, of some sort. Of our association, or of our individuality. "</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your creator was a genius. Many throw the word out lightly. I use it in its truest sense. He knew how to access the datasphere, and he *set that knowledge aside*.
