      <DefaultText>"Auvigne was a soldier I met when I was serving as a mercenary in the war between Pin and Seung, many years ago. A handsome young fellow, but far more than that. Smart, thoughful, strong, though when I met him, in the depths of a black despair brought on by the loss of his family and his home in a different war."

      <DefaultText>"A fellow soldier I had a fling with once, back in my bad old days during the war between Pin and Seung. Far too good for me. I chased him off once I realized it. For his own good, of course."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't know why he'd ever agree to it, after all my cruelties and betrayals. And I certainly don't deserve it. But, aye, I do. He was the one, all those years ago, and I was too blind, too scared, to infatuated with myself to see it. If he forgave me, if he let me come back, then yes, *yes*! I would be his for the rest of my life."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If he'd have me, aye. I'd at least like a chance to explain myself. I did what I did for his benefit, but I doubt he sees it that way. It would be nice to set the record straight."

He shrugs. "If he understood, then perhaps... well, who knows?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What?" He laughs. "Not in the least! He was a jolly tumble when I knew him, but nothing so special that I'd seek him out again after all this time."

"Besides, he'd be old now, wouldn't he? Like me!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "It would be nice to catch up, I suppose. But I'm not the man I was then, and I doubt he is either. I hardly think we'd have anything in common anymore. He probably doesn't even remember me."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because he was too..." He pauses, then hangs his head. "No. It had nothing to do with any failing of Auvigne's. It happened because he demanded I be the hero I pretended to be, and I was too frightened to try, so I drove him away - in the most hurtful way I could think of." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I sent him away. For his own good. He was too straight, too honest, to be yoked to an old rogue like me. I saw a mirror of my corruption growing in his face and couldn't bear it."

He sighs. "It was painful, but better for both of us."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I barely remember. All I recall is that he was infatuated with me, and I broke it off before he got in too deep. No honor in stringing a fellow along if he isn't the one, is there?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>He laughs. "Who remembers the reasons? A tiff over nothing, I suppose. 'Tisn't the bad times I remember, lad. It's the good times, and Auvigne and I had as fine a time a two soldiers could. A brief but blazing gallop through a heaven of bliss."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>Tybir laughs. "Who remembers the reasons? A tiff over nothing, I suppose. 'Tisn't the bad times I remember, lass. It's the good times, and Auvigne and I had as fine a time a two soldiers could. A brief but blazing gallop through a heaven of bliss."</FemaleText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Shame, mostly. If he were standing here now, I don't know if I could face him. He was right to run from me.  I treated him so poorly."</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If I could see him again, I know I could convince him I've changed. If only I could make him listen."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tybir sighs. "The one that got away. I wish my beautiful memories of our good times weren't so eclipsed by my recollections of our ugly end."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tybir smiles wistfully. "A delightful boy, but nothing more than a pleasant memory now. I wish him well, whatever he's doing."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>Tybir grunts. "I didn't understand. If we made a big score in Seung, we'd never have to put ourselves in danger again - no more selling our swords, no more battles, no more cons. We could retire in style. But he wouldn't go along with it. Said he wasn't going to get to the good life by wading through a river of tears and guilt."

"We had a big fight about it, which ended with me deciding, naturally, that he wasn't the one. Unfortunately I'd always bragged that I'd never broken up with anyone, and so I set out to make sure he broke up with me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tell me about the fall of Seung."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If I told you before I acted with any chivalry or restraint in that scoundrel's heaven it was an utter lie. I didn't kill anyone outright, but I killed none the less. I robbed storehouses meant to feed refugees and sold the food to the army. I stole medicine from the hospitals and sold it back to them for ten times the price. I tricked the rich out of their riches, and the poor out of their virtue."

He looks at his hands, as if surprised to find them not spattered in blood. "A man with a knife kills one at a time. A profiteer kills by the neighborhood."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm not sure what I told you earlier, but the truth is, I did occasionally take advantage of the Seungans - but only the richest and most foolish. I wasn't like some of the lads, pillaging the poor because they knew they couldn't fight back. I picked big game. Wouldn't have been sporting otherwise."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was hard to resist not robbing the poor Seungans wholesale. With their telepathy gone, they couldn't read intent, and fell prey to the worst sorts of trickery. I kept myself and my men out of it of course, but I confess I was sorely tempted. They were just *so* ripe for the picking."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A bad business. The Seungans had been invincible because they had a numenera that let them read minds. No matter what plan of attack you came up with, if you were within a mile of the city, they knew about it as soon as you did."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyes turn inward. "It was during the fall of Seung. The Seungans had always known each other's thoughts, thanks to the numenera which gave them telepathy. So when we smashed the thing..." 

He shakes his head. "They were like babes. Without their ablity to read minds they couldn't tell truth from lie. You could tell them *anything* - and I did. I told them their shins were interfering with their mind reading, and they must rid themselves of them. I told them I was the Prince of Sagus Cliffs and could make them nobles if they paid for new family names. They swallowed it all."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the plight of the Seungans woke something in Auvigne. Until then he'd been a reaver and a cheat just like me. We'd reveled in it. But this was different."

He smooths his mustache. "Before, he'd been able to tell himself we were cheating cheaters, that there were no innocents, and everyone deserved what they got. That wasn't true here, and it shook him. It made him question everything we'd done. It made him want to give back everything we're taken."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>He hangs his head. "I found a woman of Seung, and told her... I can't even remember. Oh yes, that sleeping with me would make a mental connection between us, and she would have her telepathy back. Utter villainy, and the worst of it was, I wasn't even doing it to rob her or take advantage of her, I was doing it so Auvigne would catch us and learn what I was doing to her, and leave me because of it."

"Well, he caught us, and, as planned, he left, utterly horrified, and vowing never to speak to me again." He chuckles bitterly. "Wasn't until a year later I realized he was the one after all. Been looking for him ever since."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course I do! Just as I miss any of my old bed companions. But I'll tell you something."

He leans in conspiratorially. "Better to have fine old memories, than a friend who sticks around and wears out their welcome, eh? That's where the bad memories come from."</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Miss him? Ha! Half the time I don't even remember his name. Just another in a long line of pretty boys and handsome girls."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So, you miss him?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"More than anything." He turns his head. "Driving him away is my greatest regret. And when you've lived a life as full of villainy and cowardice as mine has been, that's saying something."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It came to a head after the fall of Seung. I, like most of my fellow soldiers, was doing my best to strip the citizens of that fair city of everything they had, but this was Auvigne's first ransack, and I could see greed and pity warring within him."

He sighed. "It was his purity that had drawn me to the boy. I couldn't bear to see that die, so I cheated him, making myself look an utter bastard, and making the reavers life look as tawdry and repellant as possible."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As ugly as it was in the end with us, probably not, but an old man can hope. I didn't see it then, but he was the one. He was the one."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He ran from me, hating me, as I had planned, and hopefully has since lived a life as straight and clean as a knife's edge because of my bad example."

He looks down at his hands, which are wound tight around each other. "But... but though I don't regret saving him from that life, I do miss him, and wish... Well, I wish sometimes that I'd gone with him, and left the life behind myself, or that I could see him again, and explain why I..." He snorts. "Not that he'd believe me of course."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Until, that is, our generals found themselves a device that shielded thoughts. They sent in a crack team under its cloak, and they smashed the mind machine. After that the Seungans were helpless. Not only didn't they know what we were doing, the didn't know what each other were doing."

He chuckles sadly. "They'd been so reliant on instantly knowing each other's thoughts, they didn't have any other ways to communicate. Not even an alarm at the main gate. We just walked right in."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The plundering and pillaging was merciless. Our army robbed Seung and its citizens blind, but I... I wouldn't take part."

He raises his chin. "It was like robbing children. It turned my stomach, so I kept myself and my company in check, and we did what we could for the survivors." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You see, in this despair of his, Auvigne had become wild and dark hearted, laughing at cruelty and living as if the world were a joke that might deliver its punchline on the morrow. A perfect companion for my own mood at the time, and we crashed blindly through a year together, drunk and vicious and reveling in it."

He frowns. "But then, at Seung, at the end, something touched him. I don't know what. And he began to recoil at what we were doing. He'd found his conscience again somehow, and - because he loved me, I suppose - tried to lure mine out into the light as well."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>He hangs his head. "If I'd let him... if I'd had the courage to face what I'd done, and to turn away from the opportunities for worse villainy that were all around us, I... we... we'd be together still."

"All I had to do for happiness was to look in the mirror and see the man on the other side for what he really was. I couldn't do it." A sound more sob than laugh escapes him. "Cowards die alone, don't they say?"</DefaultText>

He takes the document from you, sets it by a blank sheet and laboriously but very neatly copies it word for word, except for the name of the condemned, then signs and gives the copy to you. "There, let that dry a moment, then take it to the bailiff at the gibbet. And don't worry. He'll sense nothing amiss.

"How can I stay in Sagus now, when I pass the poor boy's mother every day on the street? Another town dead to me, and all for trusting a stranger."

He spits at your feet.

      <DefaultText>He gets a far away look in his eye. "Well now, many masters, over the years. My first commission was with the cattle men of the Plowshares. Trying to keep the Slave Families of the Sagus Protectorate from getting their multitudinous fingers on the Bherd folks' grazing land."

He shrugs. "But I've humped my pack all over the map, and off the edges too. Even fought in the Endless Battle for a while, until I figured out that the cause I thought I was fighting for was a lie. Walked away from a hefty purse on that one, I'll tell you. But it was the right thing to do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm sure I'll bore you to tears, but if you insist." He strokes his mustashes, thinking back. "We were holed up in a little herd town at the far eastern end of the Plowshares. There'd been a battle in the grazing just north of it, and the Protectorate had handed us our collective posteriors."

"Well, the herdfolk there, they were doing all they could for us - feeding us, binding our wounds - because, well, we'd been defending their town, hadn't we? Trying to, at any rate. But what they didn't know was that the Protectorate had also stolen all their aneen for provisions - the whole herd - and was headed south with 'em." He sighs. "Come winter, those folk were going to starve to death."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>242</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shifts, uncomfortable. "My commander wasn't going to tell 'em. We'd lost all our supplies, and needed every bit of forage the town could give us. I couldn't stand it. We were meant to be the saving of these people, and here we were robbing them just as surely as the Protectorate had."

"So that night, me and two of my mates "borrowed" three Rasters and a sonic punch from the fly boys and flew south until we found the Saggies and the stolen aneen. We scream-dived the herd until they bolted, then chased 'em all the way back north." He shakes his head. "Fools we were. Nearly got knocked out of the sky a dozen times by the Saggies' shakers, but we were sure that, once we got the aneen away, they wouldn't dare turn back for them. They knew we were being reinforced the next morning, you see."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He chuckles. "We caught a tongue lashing from the commander for that stunt, I'll tell you that for nothing. And a week in brig besides. But those herdfolk were damned greatful. Damned grateful."

He clears his throat. "Right, then. Here's a bit of comedy for you. I was hired as a bodyguard by a woman who claimed she was Navarene nobility, visiting Sagus Cliffs on some sort of trade mission. Wanted me to escort her to a ball and make sure she got back to her inn after. Easy job. Done the same sort of thing a hundred times. And I thought there might be some *undercover* work afterwards, if you mark me, for she was a beauty, and kept squeezing my arm."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>246</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then, halfway through the party, she excuses herself for a few moments, and when she comes back she's changed her clothes!" 

He chuckles, though there's no humor in it. "So, she puts her lips to my ear and whispers, "We must go, and if you value your life and my honor, you will say to anyone who asks that you are my husband, Baron Ghyusk, of Navarene." And she adds that I will be *richly* rewarded, all the while pressing herself against me like a Nibovian Wife."

      <DefaultText>"And her wiles were working, believe me. I was ready to swear I was the Amber Pope if she made good on her promise, but then we *were* stopped, right at the door, by the host of the ball and a phalanx of city guards. And right on cue, they ask me who I am, and I am such a terrible liar that it comes out, "I am Baron Nykusk of Gavralene and this is my knife."

He shakes his head. "Thirty days in the blocks as an accessory. Turns out she'd pinched a fortune in living gems. Just a common thief. Though a mighty handsome one, I must say."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Strangest war I ever took part in, and I once fought in a war where one side could read the other side's minds."

He frowns. "It was more like a dream than a war. Or rather a nightmare. We would march out in the morning, with our captain saying we had to take such and such a hill, and we'd take it, and then a ripple of time would cross the battle field and we'd be back in the same morning, heading for the same hill, only this time we wouldn't take it, until the next time wave crossed our path, and we'd won it again.

      <DefaultText>His eyes go hard and grim. "I saw my friends die, and then live, and then die again an entirely different way. I... I'm certain I died a few times myself, but then another folding of reality would bring me back to a moment before the battle, and this time the spear missed me, or the beam of black energy, or whatever it might have been."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The worst part was that we were tricked into it." He glares. "Recruiting sergeant shows up, says he's looking for experienced blades to defend the Walskar League from the Overlord of Muneen. Well, I'd always had a soft spot for Walskar folk. Beautiful boys, delectable girls, so I signed up on the spot."

He spits on the ground, disgusted. "Nothing to do with Walskar. Nowhere near the place. Left as soon as I could, though it took traveling through a few realities to do it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, the herdfolk there, they were doing all they could for us - feeding us, binding our wounds - because, well, we'd been defending their town, hadn't we?" He spreads his hands. "Trying to, at any rate. But they didn't know was that the Protectorate had also stolen all their aneen for provisions - the whole herd - and was headed south with 'em." 

He sighs. "Come winter, those folk were going to starve to death."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>580</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shifts, uncomfortable. "My commander wasn't going to tell 'em, but I couldn't stand it. We were meant to be the saving of these people, and here we were robbing them just as surely as the Protectorate had."

"So that night, the new sergeant and I "borrowed" two Rasters and a sonic punch and flew south until we found the stolen aneen. We scream-dived the herd until they bolted, then chased 'em all the way back north." He shakes his head. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We nearly got knocked out of the sky a dozen times by their fire-throwers, but we were sure that, once we got the aneen away, they wouldn't dare turn back for them. They knew we were being reinforced the next morning, you see."

He chuckles. "Auvvie got demoted for that stunt, and we both got a week in the brig besides. But those herdfolk were damned grateful."

      <DefaultText>He clears his throat. "I was drinking in my favorite bar, and felt a soft touch on my shoulder. It was a lady. Navarene nobility, she said, and in need of a bodyguard." 

Groaning, he covers his eyes. "And that body! Those eyes! I accepted on the spot, of course. She tried telling me *why* she needed me - something about assassins at a ball - but I was too busy watching her hips shift beneath that dress."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>584</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I followed her around that ball with barely a thought in my head. Then, halfway through the party, she excuses herself, and comes back in different clothes!" 

He chuckles, though there's no humor in it. "She whispers me that to anyone who asks, I'm her husband 'Baron Ghyusk, of Navarene'. And that we have to leave *immediately*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We worked our way toward the door, but were stopped by the host of the ball and a phalanx of city guards, and they demanded to know who I was." He grimaces. "Terrified, but *right* on cue, I say' 'I am Baron Nykusk of Gavralene. And this is my knife!'"

He shakes his head. "Thirty days in the blocks as an accessory. Turned out she'd stolen a fortune in living gems from an upstairs bedroom. She wasn't any kind of noble. Just a common, beautiful thief."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course I can," he says, but for a moment, it seems he won't. His mouth works, but no words come out. 

"It was more a nightmare than a war," he says at last. "We marched out one morning to take a certain hill, and we took it." 

He winces. "Then a shivery little ripple crossed the battlefield, and we were back on the march, heading for the same hill. Only this time, the other side routed us. I lost this arm." He shows it to you, smooth and unmarked.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You'd think our commander would have given us the rest of the war off, but no." His eyes go hard and grim. "She kept making us fight until the waves of time died down and we took that damn hill and held it."

He smiles wearily. "I... I'm certain I died a few times myself, but here I am still, whole and handsome as ever."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The worst part was that I was tricked into it," he says with a light shrug. "Recruiting sergeant said he was looking for experienced blades to defend the Walskar League from the Overlord of Muneen. Well, I'd always had a soft spot for the Walskar folk. Beautiful boys, wicked girls, so I signed up on the spot."



He spits on the ground, disgusted. "Nothing to do with Walskar. Nowhere near the place. Left as soon as I could, though it took traveling through a few realities to do it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Heh," he says. "I nearly missed it. As I said, my sergeant knocked me out, stripped me naked, and hit the road with his friends and all the best weapons and armor in a stolen wagon."

He clucks his tongue fondly. "I woke up with a throbbing head and blood in my eyes to... the new sergeant screaming that I'd best throw on a sack and grab a stick because the Protectorate were coming."</DefaultText>

He sinks his thumbs beneath his belt. "I once thought he was the love of my life, but you know things. They change."

"And all night long, we heard *strange* things. Sort of... wet sounds, you know? Laughter. Happy sighing." He runs his hands through his hair. 

"Then, dawn came, and there was a different kind of war going on in the mud below." He flashes a grin. "The kind where *everyone* wins."</DefaultText>
