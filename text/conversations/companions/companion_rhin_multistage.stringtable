    <Entry>
      <ID>138</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "No. I'm talking to Ahl. He isn't a stone. He's a god. He lives inside the stone."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>140</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks offended, then seems to think better of it. "A little bit," she admits. "But Ahl isn't imaginary. And he's not a stone. He's a god. He lives *inside* the stone."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>141</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm not talking to someone who isn't there." She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the stone. "He's right *here.* And he's not a stone. He's a god. He lives *inside* the stone."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>146</ID>
      <DefaultText>She takes a deep breath, looking thoughtful. "Stones are typically smoother. And wiser. And lazier. And more vain." 

She looks distracted for a moment, then says. "I'm sorry but it's true. Rocks are brash. And they're more jaggedy. They tend to be smaller, too.... Yes I know it's a stereotype. You're being rude. Stop interrupting." 

She looks up at you. "I'm sorry. He's sensitive about it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>147</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Anyway, the stone isn't Ahl. Ahl's a god. He lives *inside* the stone."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>148</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So the stone is like his body? Or is it like his house?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>149</ID>
      <DefaultText>She smiles. "It's a little like both. It's easier for him to leave than a body. But harder to leave than a house. But either way, the stone isn't really him. It's a little like a cup, too."

Rhin looks up at you hopefully. "Does that make sense?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>157</ID>
      <DefaultText>She makes a wavering gesture with one hand. "That's pretty close. It's tricky stuff, and I'm not that great at explaining it."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>158</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her face lights up in excitement. "That's it exactly! The water might even taste a little like the cup, if the cup is made of tin. Or it might even taste a little like whatever was in the cup before. But you can pour it somewhere else and it's still the same water."

She hesitates, then adds, "*Almost* the same water. Mostly the same."</DefaultText>

      <ID>162</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks down at the stone in her hand, speaking softly. "But here there are no gods. It's like finding a place where people don't know what meat is. Or... air. How do you explain something like that?"

"And I haven't seen a single god except for Ahl himself. And he is mine. He simply is. He is my friend..."

Rhin trails off, looking down at the stone in her hand.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>183</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods, and without noticing she lifts up the hand with the stone in it so that she's holding it close to her heart. "Some gods can help you with more than words. Ahl knows everything of hiding. Of being small and silent. He helps me hide. He makes it so no one can find me. He keeps me safe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her laugh has no humor in it. "Of course I'm all right. Why wouldn't I be all right? I'm far from home. I have stitches where hair should be.

      <DefaultText>A horrified expression races across Rhin's face. "Is that what they do here? Is that why you people don't have any proper gods? Did they lock up all the people who talked to them?"

      <DefaultText>Rhin brings her hands to her mouth slowly, her eyes terrified and oddly flat, almost glazed. She turns away from you, speaking to something in her hands, her voice too soft for you to hear.

She continues like that for a long time, worried and muttering. You realize she has forgotten you are even there.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She yanks Ahl from her pocket and holds him in front of her face. "Ahl, did... do you know about this?"

She cocks her head the way she does when she listens to him. A worried expression blooms on her face. Suddenly she gasps. A tear drips from the corner of one eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes," she says. Then to the stone: "Why? Why did you do this?"

She listens more. You hear something, like a bird rustling in its egg, but you can't tell if it's from the stone or something else.

Her head still cocked, Rhin speaks to you, her voice strangely flat. "He's been hiding parts of my memory from the beginning. He wanted me to blend in, to avoid undue attention. And he was... *worried*. He thought if I knew the truth, I would have given up a long time ago. From the beginning."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tell me then!" she says to the stone. Her face reddens, angrier than you've ever seen her. "What have you been keeping from me?"

She listens for what seems a long time, her expression increasingly frightened as she does. Finally, she lets her hands fall and she tells you.

"I ran away. I was angry at them, my parents. Something stupid, something we'd fought over a hundred times. But this time I left. I packed my things, took my coat, and when the moon was high I... just walked out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I thought I was prepared. Thought I was safe. But they attacked me. Amar... No, I shouldn't say their name. Soldiers. It doesn't matter."

Her knuckles whiten around the stone. "I ran. They ran faster. I made a god somehow, a god of going forth. I must have cut a way into this world and fallen through it. I guess it saved my life, but then... the slavers, my head, Ahl..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, I'm not. It was *Ahl*, the whole time." She clutches the stone. "Why?"

She listens more. You hear something, like a bird rustling in its egg, but you can't tell if it's from the stone or not.

Her head still cocked, Rhin speaks to you, her voice flat. "He's been hiding parts of my memory from the beginning. He wanted me to blend in, to avoid undue attention. And he was... *worried*. He thought if I knew the truth, I would have given up a long time ago. From the beginning."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She stays there on her knees for a long time, sobbing, then sniffling. Finally, she wipes her face on her sleeve.

She stands up and walks over to where she threw Ahl. She stares at the rock for a while, then bends down and puts it in her pocket. "I need him," she says to no one in particular.

She straightens, her face a mask. "Are we going or what?"</DefaultText>

She stands and walks over to the stone. She stares at it for a while then says, "I can't forgive you, Ahl. Not yet... but you *are* my friend." She bends down and picks him up, then places him gently into her pocket.

"We should go," she says without looking at you. "We need to go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scowls and shouts at the stone. "You *kept* it from me. You walked into my mind and *stole* from me! I can *never* forgive you. Never!"

She pulls back and throws the stone as far away as she can manage. Then she collapses to her knees, her shoulders shuddering with each sob.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A flash of panic crosses her face. "What? No one," she says, too quickly.

Then she sighs and pulls something from her pocket. It's a small, dark stone with a hole in it. She's outside your arm's reach, but she still holds it close to her chest, protectively.</DefaultText>
