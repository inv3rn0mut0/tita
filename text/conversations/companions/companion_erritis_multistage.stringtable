      <DefaultText>"From the storms of the south. At first, I think I was only an outline in the clouds of dust, but then..." Erritis leans forward, palms spread, eyes wide, "I emerged. Swords in every hand! Cape swirling. You should have been there!"  </DefaultText>

      <ID>135</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's a strange question," he says, his glow dimming. "Babies aren't interesting."

Then he brightens. Literally, of course. "You're asking when I realized I was a hero!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>136</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I." He frowns, cocking his head. "I don't remember. Maybe I'm supposed to tell you I've always been one."

He looks up, nodding. "I've always been a hero."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"Who knows," he says, waving a careless hand. "Who cares. Heroes come from villages, so that's probably where I'm from. A village."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The glow abruptly fades from Erritis. He looks older. Plainer. Exhausted beyond endurance.

"W-what?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>146</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You never asked me about voices in my head," Erritis says, rolling his eyes. "I would have remembered a *crazy* question like that."</DefaultText>

      <ID>147</ID>
      <DefaultText>Then, the golden light returns, a savage explosion of radiance and heat, driving you back a step. 

Erritis regards you calmly from within the pulsing nova. He is so beautiful that it's hard to look at him.

"I have no idea what you're talking about."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>148</ID>
      <DefaultText>Then, the golden light returns, a savage explosion of radiance and heat, driving you back a step. Even half-blinded, you see that the glow is coming from within him - springing from his pores like tiny stars. 

Erritis regards you calmly from within the pulsing nova. He is almost unbearably handsome.  

"I have no idea what you're talking about."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>149</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Let's talk about something else now. You aren't interested in this." His voice is dull and dreamy, and his eyes wander about your face without seeing you. 

Then, the glow recedes like a retreating wave, and Erritis blinks. He sees that you're looking his way, then looks behind him to see what you're staring at.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I close my eyes sometimes," he says, blinking. He gasps, and points at the offending lids urgently. "Did you see that? I did it again! That *does* it."

      <ID>174</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's working," Erritis gasps, tears streaming from his eyes. "I'd congratulate myself, but it's probably better if you do it. No one likes to hear a handsome man giving himself compliments."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Erritis blinks at you. Several times.

"That is the strangest question I've been asked by someone else in the last two minutes."

He stares at the air. "No. I think I'd remember being in your head. It seems like you'd have a nice one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How can you say that?" he says, hurt. "I'm on a quest to find quests! I thought you knew that!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>196</ID>
      <DefaultText>He scowls, and waggles a finger in your face. 

"I like a joke as much as anyone, but you should never, *ever*, fiddle with a man's quest."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>198</ID>
      <DefaultText>He bites his lip furiously. "I'm still *looking* for the right quest, but I'll know it when I see it! It's the one that will lead me to the destiny that I think I'd see in my dreams if I ever manage to sleep again."

Rubbing his eyes with his hands, he says. "It's just so... so exhausting. I want the treasure and the glory and the... the heroic stuff, but when I have it? It's never enough. I'm always looking for the next quest."

He cradles his head. "It's just never enough."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>200</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't really remember it," Erritis says, chewing his lip. "But in the moment before she touched my hand and everything went white and screamy, she seemed nice. You should probably follow her advice."</DefaultText>

      <ID>204</ID>
      <DefaultText>Erritis gives your question somber thought. The effect is somewhat ruined by the fact that several of his long golden hairs are standing entirely on end. 

"Not at all," he concludes at last. "I feel completely normal." A spark leaps from his head and *pops* in the air. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>205</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>213</ID>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>215</ID>
      <DefaultText>He clutches at your shoulders, peering around you, and spots Matkina for what is apparently the first time. His jaw drops.

"Uh."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>218</ID>
      <DefaultText>She stares at him, unblinking, and turns to you. "Why is he looking at me like that?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>220</ID>
      <DefaultText>She glares at you, trying to decipher your devilish clue. Understanding dawns along with a slow, creeping horror. 

"Don't," she says to Erritis, "Really, don't. Insomuch as I *have* a type, you aren't it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>221</ID>
      <DefaultText>Erritis takes a shuddering gasp, blinks with what appears to be every muscle in his body, and rips his gaze from Matkina. 

"What... what were we talking about? Oh. The others. Who do you want my opinion on?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>223</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her eyes go wide in horror. Then, she glares at Erritis.

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>224</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You can probably guess," Erritis says. His tone is soft, and more serious than you've ever heard it. "I have feelings for her. Many feelings. I've lost count of all of them, to be honest."

He stares past you. "I'm a hero, if I haven't told you that already. The greatest hero. Impossible things don't worry me. I do them all the time."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>226</ID>
      <DefaultText>Lifting his gaze to the air, he continues. "But I think some things are more impossible than impossible. And making her fall in love with me might be one of those things."</DefaultText>

      <ID>230</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Poetry," he says, ticking his fingers. "Hiding mysterious boxes of sweets in her bags. Singing to her when she's sleeping. Showing her how fast I can run. Telling her romantic stories." He hesitates. "She *really* doesn't seem to like those."</DefaultText>
