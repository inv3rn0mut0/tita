      <DefaultText>"But you could know, if you would only take a taste of her." She sees the look on your face and relents.

"I had only hoped to discover the conviction that spurred her to such lengths. It seems to me to take a great amount of determination to choose to end your own life. When considered from certain angles it is, after all, the only truth we really have about ourselves."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a waste." She speaks without hesitation. "Knowledge lost, for no gain. In this case, at least, her death served a purpose, but beyond her guilt we know nothing else of her life. What other mysteries might she have solved if she remained alive? It is that which upsets me, dear, and no mere loss of life."</DefaultText>

      <ID>84</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her face softens for a moment, then she gives you a wan smile.

    <Entry>
      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I never suggested that it was, dear." She pats you magnanimously on the arm, as though soothing an overwrought child.

"There, now, we shall discuss it no further."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>90</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No? So you would doom us all to unnecessary theatrics instead?" She pats you magnanimously on the arm, as though soothing an overwrought child.

    <Entry>
      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And if they make decisions that harm themselves? If you care for them, what then?" She presses a finger to her lips, bu removes it again, agitated.

"You and I - we are both caught in situations beyond our control. You, your deaths, and me, my... my weakness." She subconsciously touches the Attractor as she speaks.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>92</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A valid point, dear. We are only ever the products of our choices." She nods at you. "You of yours, and me of mine. It's some small comfort, if you can let it be."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps self-determination is the true burden," she says, almost to herself. "Our one inescapable freedom also creates the chains with which we bind ourselves to consequence." She looks to you, her expression hunted.

"Perhaps this is what Herja knew. Would that I could unthink it myself."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I knew that if it ever came after me, if I so much as crossed its path again, it would undo me, for now and for all time, simply by virtue of knowing *you*!"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I knew that it would stop at nothing to see you dead." She takes a step back. "And that I would be next if I were to stand in its way."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>96</ID>
      <DefaultText>She quietens, and stares at you with a mixture of disgust, despair, and admiration.

"How can I stay with you?" she asks, taking a step back. "How can you ask this of me?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>105</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Dear heart..." She takes another step back, then stops.

"I can refuse you nothing," she says, shakily. "You know this. You know it." She stares at you, her expression haunted, then slowly  moves back to stand by your side.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>106</ID>
      <DefaultText>With one more step, she turns and flees into the bowels of the Bloom.

    <Entry>
      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>She looks at you, taking in your words with barely more than a flicker of acknowledgement. Then she moves slowly toward you, until you stand face to face.

"Do not let it devour me," she says, searching your eyes. "That is all I ask."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <ID>111</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What you say is true," she concedes. She takes a half step back, then stops.

"Do not let it devour me." The plea in her words is nowhere in her expression as she comes back to stand by your side.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>112</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You dare?" Her eyes flash fire, and for once her echoes mirror her movements exactly. "You put *my* life and the lives of everyone at risk and you have the gall to suggest it is none of my concern?" She spits at your feet.

"That for you and your great castofflegacy!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>113</ID>
      <DefaultText>With one last withering glare, she turns and runs away from you, into the bowels of the Bloom.
