      <DefaultText>"That's a fair conclusion," he says, chewing his lip. "I don't like thinking about him, if I'm being honest." He looks down, visibly marshalling his words. 

"Always had an opinion about my... livelihood, did Auvvie," he says at last. "I felt like I was disappointing him with every breath I took. He turned all of my victories sour with his little sighs. So I broke it off as clean as I could and wished him well."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, I wasn't the best or the worst," he says with a shrug. "But I started at the bottom, fell out the side, and ended up a gallowglass on my own."

He sighs. "It's not an easy life, being a mercenary. But you try to fight for causes you believe in, and avoid striking blows that aren't deserved. And you try not to fail at both while the realities of life batter you into new shapes. Change you."</DefaultText>

"My father raised me to be honest. Well, honesty works on a farm. Animals don't lie to you much, as a rule. But as a soldier..."

He squints. "Put it like this. First night in the camp, I was mugged by my sergeant and left for dead. All because I thought an honest face meant an honest heart."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But I've been all over the map, and off the edges too, having good times and bad. Went with the Ailu Rebels, the White Company... even fought in the Endless Battle for a while, until I figured out my commander was lying to me. Walked away from a hefty purse on that one, I'll tell you. But it was the right thing to do."

      <DefaultText>"Whew," he says, with a misty look at the air. "I've fought for a number of causes over the years. My first fight was alongside the rugged cattle men of the Plowshares. Trying to keep the Slave Families of the Sagus Protectorate from getting their hands on the Bherd folks' grazing land."

      <DefaultText>"Of course I can," he says, but for a moment, it seems he won't. His mouth works, but no words come out. 

"It was more a nightmare than a war," he says at last. "We marched out one morning to take a certain hill, and we took it." 

He winces. "Then a shivery little ripple crossed the battlefield, and we were back on the march, heading for the same hill. Only this time, the other side routed us. I lost this arm." He shows it to you, smooth and unmarked.  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You'd think our commander would have given us the rest of the war off, but no." His eyes go hard and grim. "She kept making us fight until the waves of time died down and we took that damn hill and held it."

He smiles wearily. "I... I'm certain I died a few times myself, but here I am still, whole and handsome as ever."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The worst part was that I was tricked into it," he says with a light shrug. "Recruiting sergeant said he was looking for experienced blades to defend the Walskar League from the Overlord of Muneen. Well, I'd always had a soft spot for the Walskar folk. Beautiful boys, wicked girls, so I signed up on the spot."



He spits on the ground, disgusted. "Nothing to do with Walskar. Nowhere near the place. Left as soon as I could, though it took traveling through a few realities to do it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can't recall much about the battle itself. Lots of screaming, and most of it mine. I remember hitting a number of heads with that stick, and I lost the sack at some point. No one seemed prepared to comment, what with all the dying."

He sighs. "At any rate. The Protectorate kicked our teeth in and drove us back to a little herd town at the far eastern end of the Plowshares." He winces at the memory. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, the herdfolk there, they were doing all they could for us - feeding us, binding our wounds - because, well, we'd been defending their town, hadn't we?" He spreads his hands. "Trying to, at any rate. But they didn't know that the Protectorate had also stolen all their aneen for provisions - the whole herd - and was headed south with 'em." 

He sighs. "Come winter, those folk were going to starve to death."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shifts, uncomfortable. "My commander wasn't going to tell 'em, but I couldn't stand it. We were meant to be the saving of these people, and here we were robbing them just as surely as the Protectorate had."

"So that night, the new sergeant and I 'borrowed' two Rasters and a sonic punch and flew south until we found the stolen aneen. We scream-dived the herd until they bolted, then chased 'em all the way back north." He shakes his head. </DefaultText>

He chuckles. "Auvvie got demoted for that stunt, and we both got a week in the brig besides. But those herdfolk were damned grateful."

He winks. "Some of them several times."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He clears his throat. "I was drinking in my favorite bar, and felt a soft touch on my shoulder. It was a lady. Navarene nobility, she said, and in need of a bodyguard." 

Groaning, he covers his eyes. "And that body! Those eyes! I accepted on the spot, of course. She tried telling me *why* she needed me - something about assassins at a ball - but I was too busy watching her hips shift beneath that dress."</DefaultText>

He shakes his head. "Thirty days in the blocks as an accessory. Turned out she'd stolen a fortune in living gems from an upstairs bedroom. She wasn't any kind of noble. Just a common, beautiful thief."</DefaultText>

"And all night long, we heard *strange* things. Sort of... wet sounds, you know? Laughter. Happy sighing." He runs his hands through his hair.

He rubs an eye with the heel of his hand. "The two of us had a fine time, while it lasted. And the more I pick and pluck through these memories, the more I'm thinking it would be nice to see him again, even if he's scowling."

He covers his eyes with his calloused hands. "But no. Auvvie - Auvigne - wanted to run things. To choose the fights he thought were worth fighting. And he wanted to drag me along with him." Groaning, he lets his hands fall.

"Have mercy, hey?" he says. "Telling all of this hasn't been easy, and I know I had a part in... what went wrong between us."

      <DefaultText>"Gave it away," Tybir says quickly. "I could still feel him through it, of course. Still touch his mind at will, and feel the hurt in him."

      <DefaultText>"Oh, no. Our commander separated us after we got out of the brig," Tybir chuckles. "He didn't want us planning more herd heists. I didn't see Auvvie for a handful of years after that, when we both landed in the only mercenary company that'd have us."

He scratches his cheek. "You see, even mercenaries have rules. Don't sell the company's weapons on the side, for one." He raises a guilty hand. "And don't break your captain's jaw, even if you're Auvvie and think he's a rock-humping sadist."    </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, they made us closer," he says wearily. "And at first, there was no downside. We were new lovers with a mental link - I don't think I need to draw you a picture."

He massages his knuckles. "We were tough fighters on our own. With our thoughts linked, well, we were unstoppable. And fools enough to think that the good times would last."

      <DefaultText>"So we ended up in the Broken Riverbed Company. Thieves, murderers, and drunks with nowhere else to go, but the commander had a good heart. Took the contracts he believed in. Believed in redemption."

Tybir shakes his head ruefully. "Well, he signed us up to guard a village trapped between two enemy fronts. Half of us bolted when they saw the armies coming, and the rest when the bombardment started. I saw a big man pinned beneath some rubble and nearly left him *anyway* before I saw his face."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Back in the early days, the mind-sharing powers of those rings were... well, they were stronger. And even though we were far from the, ha, fighting, we felt the effects. We stood there, watching the magic unfold below, and gradually felt each other's thoughts creeping into our heads."

Tybir closes his eyes. "Finally, he turns to me and says, 'You should have said something sooner.' And he puts his hand in mine."</DefaultText>

"The first time, Auvvie and I fought our way to the top before something *snapped* in our gut, and we were back at the bottom, two hours back. We charged up again... and this time, one of those fireballs landed right on us."

Tybir studies his bicep. "My arm burst apart like rotten fruit, and Auvvie died on the spot. I felt his mind wink out inside me, like someone had crushed him in their fist."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The captain helped me pull Auvvie out just before a slug took the top of his head off. That smile never left his face." Tybir sighs. "I like to think he died thinking he'd turned one life around before the end."

Tybir spits. "I was even faster in those days, and Auvvie was freakish strong. We fought our way off the battlefield, trench by trench, and kept running after that."

Tybir lets his hand fall. "Then he gave me one of them. Said he'd be able to keep track of me if we got separated in a scrap, and find me if I was in trouble."

He swallows. "We fought for that damned hill for what felt like lifetimes, dying and dying. Eventually, one of our victories stuck, and Auvvie and I got the hell out there." 

After a moment of silence, he says, "Auvvie took that whole mess as a sign that it was time to create our own company. But I was still mourning for him."</DefaultText>
