      <DefaultText>"First, let me get this out of the way, since Aadiriis told you to ask me - the Endless Battle used to mean something. It used to be people with principles. But they lost sight of their true goals. It became a self-perpetuating war machine. I don't think the First could stop it now even if she were alive. Our sire shows no inclination to, either. It's worthless and stupid."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So. Aligern's monument. Tell me... do you think anyone will mourn our deaths? All around us... ordinary humans commemorating their dead, marking down the legacy of the fallen, expressions of love and respect. But who will do that for us?"

      <DefaultText>"I came back here after the First died. Since I couldn't kill her myself, I looked for something else to do with my life. Everyone here told me, 'accrue power', like I knew how to do that. Melmoth... he told me he'd show me. He'd help me build an enterprise if I'd help him with some troubles. I agreed."

She swallows. "He taught me how to kill people. He helped me become the White Death. He made me famous... and then he turned the levies on me."</DefaultText>
