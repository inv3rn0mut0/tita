      <DefaultText>"And then when Paj was gone and I'd calmed down, one of the others asked me what the problem was. He said the villagers would all have been dead in a few decades anyway. I vowed I'd never think like that... but here I am, a couple centuries later, and people seem to die too fast and too young, and I can't let myself care." She scuffs the dirt.

      <DefaultText>"After that, I traveled the world. I went back to Kholn to remind myself what humanity does to the strange and different. I realized I had no purpose. I went to Miel Avest to see what our brethren were doing. They hadn't changed at all. They told me to gather power."

She barks a laugh. "Our creator made us many things, but most of all he made us mad for strength in all its forms. I scorned their advice, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized the truth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So I came to Sagus Cliffs. I started working. One of our brothers hired me... and then he betrayed me. I'd thought he'd help me, but just like Paj, just like the First, just like Tash, he turned on me. That's when I learned that I can't trust anyone."</DefaultText>

She taps her forehead with the heel of her palm, as if to drive the memory home. "Yes. That's it. Gods. You rode him, and you killed him." 

Her eyes are wide. "Such power. You can change the world."

She shakes herself to cut off that train of thought.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't know when you left. Tash wiped my memories, and... wait. No. Tash fled. He deserted the First's Militia and went into hiding. He knew he could never return after such a high-profile disaster. That's right?"

"Yes. He was living in a cave in the wastes. He blamed me for his situation. Said I'd made him act a way he never would have on his own. Then he tried to attack me."

Her knife dances through her fingers again. "So I killed him. For good."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So I came to Sagus Cliffs. I started working. I sought out Melmoth for his aid, and he helped me. Then his man Yollen betrayed me, turned us against each other. I thought Melmoth had orchestrated it. I mean, I had the examples of Paj, Tash, and the First. I thought another castoff would betray me as easily as breathing. It was a mistake in judgment, I admit, but I didn't know any better."</DefaultText>

She crosses her arms. "You want to know why I was hiding before you found me? It's because I learned that I'm best on my own. If you don't have people, you can't be betrayed. There. You've got your story. Let's not talk about that anymore."</DefaultText>

The endless politics inside the group, the recriminations, fighting against other gangs, the inevitable betrayals. Ugh. I gave up on that and went solo. Eventually I went back to the Bloom and worked for the Memovira. The old one, I mean."</DefaultText>
