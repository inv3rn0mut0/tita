      <DefaultText>Her lips pucker like she's tasting something foul. "He's useful," she finally says. "At least he was, once. If that pompous laak-nibber - forgive my language, dear - finds *one* more fault with me, I expect my sisters will murder him in several realities."

She cocks her head to the side. "Hm. There goes one now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She laughs. "Now is not the time, dear, nor is the Reef a safe place for lengthy disquisition. Rest assured, when we reach the cliffs there will be plenty of time to swap tales."</DefaultText>

      <ID>221</ID>
      <DefaultText>"An astute question, my dear! The most likely answer is that your sire discovered something he could repurpose for his own designs. If you can seal a dome as well as he did, the Reef is as good a place as any for experimentation."</DefaultText>

      <ID>227</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The numenera are wondrous and deadly in equal measure. Although," her laugh chimes in the air, "Aligern will doubtless tell you *I* am the most deadly of all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They are me! We are a part of each other, sisters across infinite realities. We share our experiences... and power. What's that old saying? That experience brings wisdom? I must be the wisest person in Sagus Cliffs... the wisest across countless worlds!" Her laughter peals out.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>241</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The dome had been sealed for years. Aligern and I happened to be nearby, hunting for a way in, when you fell and opened it so neatly for us. I would call it a lucky coincidence, but perhaps this is merely the world in which that is true. In some other reality, you fell elsewhere.... or did not fall at all." She smiles. "The truth is fungible."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs, the sound echoing like the hissing of a balloon. "He was not always so sour. He was a man of science, an Aeon Priest who reveled in knowledge. But his pain has infected him, and he sees the world through that cast. It would be tragic, but..." Her echoes all seem as exasperated as she, and she continues. "But he is the same in every existence in which I know him. It has become incredibly tiresome."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>255</ID>
      <DefaultText>"About sorrow or *the* Sorrow, dear?" She emits a small chuckle. "Never mind. I know little of either."</DefaultText>

      <ID>256</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is that so? I admit I'm intrigued. Very likely you were hallucinating, of course, but what a *fascinating* vision!"</DefaultText>
