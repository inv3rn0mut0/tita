      <DefaultText>He takes another breath. It's shaky. "My real crime, the one I have trouble facing straight on, was my cowardice. I was no bloody-handed monster, not like some of the others. No butcher. But I was a monster nonetheless - a monster of craven fear, who would leave *anyone* behind to save his own life. Comrades, my own troops, refugees I was sworn to protect - I abandoned them all to their deaths so I could walk out whole. If... if you could see the train of ghosts I have walking behind me, pointing their damned fingers at me - "

He breaks off in a sob and turns away from you. "A monster. A monster!"</DefaultText>

There'd been a battle in the grazing just north of it, and the Protectorate had handed us our collective posteriors."

"Well, the herdfolk there, they were doing all they could for us - feeding us, binding our wounds - because, well, we'd been defending their town, hadn't we? Ha! Some of us had.

"Well, the herdfolk there, they were doing all they could for us - feeding us, binding our wounds - because, well, we'd been defending their town, hadn't we? Trying to, at any rate.

"I'm afraid I've been a bit more of a rogue than I've let on. So let's start over from scratch, shall we? What would you like to know? Where I'm from? What I've done with my life? Why I'm following you when I could be ruling a small kingdom in the Beyond?"
