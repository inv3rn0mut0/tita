      <DefaultText>She gets an anxious look, glancing behind her as though she heard someone call. "Sorry, I can't. I *do* understand if you don't need me, or if you need to make room for someone else. I mean, *my* life went on without you - I assumed the same was true of yours. But...

      <DefaultText>The woman strides toward you, all confidence and grace. She has none of the fear and awkwardness you remember.

And yet the eyes are still Rhin's. The fear is gone, but the bright spark of innocence and joy is still there. Brighter, even. She squeezes your shoulder with a firm hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She cocks her head in the unique way Rhin used to, looking at your pack. "You're still carrying Tehria, aren't you?" 

Your expression seems to amuse her. She laughs and says, "That god of finding I gave you, remember? Gods about, I can't believe he was strong enough. I was just a kid when I made him, and it doesn't look like you've aged much at all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods with pride. "He's a more powerful god than either of us knew. I can't take credit, though. I hardly knew what I was doing." She smiles. "I just knew I wanted to see you again. Tehria is what came of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When she laughs, it's like a song, like the sun bursting out from behind the clouds. "I should hope so! It's been, what, ten years? More?" She shakes her head. "I can't even remember."

Her face softens and she squeezes your arm. "But I'm still me. I grew up, but I'm still that little girl you rescued all those years ago."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I came because Tehria called me back. He's under the impression that you need my help." She looks around at the twisting expanse of the Labyrinth. "I'd say he might be right. Where *are* we, anyway?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods. "Tehria did what he thought was right, but it's your trouble and your call."

She looks back quickly, as though someone had called out. "Though if you don't need me, I hope you understand that I can't stay here waiting. I need to go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How have I been?" She laughs. "How do you summarize a decade of life?"

She runs a hand through her hair. You note a pale line where her scar used to be. "Life has been good, friend. I fight now, as you can see - a protector. Not for any love of the work, I grant you, but for love, absolutely."</DefaultText>

      <ID>79</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Heh, well I wasn't just sitting around waiting to save the day, you know. I was actually in the middle of something."

She adjusts her pack and glances over her shoulder again. "Anyway, this is your world, not mine. You know that. But if you need me, I'm here for you."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Now?" She shakes her head. "Sorry, friend. I crossed worlds for you. You're stuck with me to the end."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>82</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's my pleasure, old friend." She shifts her weight, her mouth half-open as if she wants to say something else but isn't sure what.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>84</ID>
      <DefaultText>She bites her lip. "I hope so. Keep Tehria on you. Maybe if you need me... Well, he called me once, didn't he?"

She glances behind her again. "Even if he doesn't, you will always be with me. I wouldn't be who I am without you."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>Suddenly she lunges forward and throws her arms around you. It's amazing how tall she is - taller than you, even. She kisses you on the cheek. When she pulls back and smiles, her tears are barely noticeable.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Farewell, my friend. My home and hearth and bread are forever yours."

A portal opens suddenly. The bright light and trees you remember from before spill out of it. She waves one last time and turns to step through it.
