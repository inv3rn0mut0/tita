      <DefaultText>Ribbons of dull bronze spiral through Erritis's golden aura.

"Maybe you didn't know this, but she didn't want to go," he adds, plucking at his doublet. "I don't think it was right of you to make her go. People should be free to run and explore and see things." His lip quivers. "They shouldn't be slaves."

He lifts his eyes to yours. "I need you to tell me why you did this."</DefaultText>
