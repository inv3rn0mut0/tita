      <DefaultText>Aligern chuckles. "I know more than you'll want to hear. But, put simply, the Tides are the currents of urge and emotion that flow through humanity's collective psyche. Usually, they are as fundamental and inviolate as the air we breathe."

He scowls. "But the Changing God found a way to violate them, to tune the tides in his body to the frequency of another so he could slip from one to the next without the discord between the tunings shaking the second body apart. And he wasn't the first."</DefaultText>
