      <DefaultText>"And even if the Maws start to close and you lose your grip on the empire, you've still got all those weapons, all that numenera, all that *possibility* from each of the worlds the Bloom touches. Rule right and you could be unstoppable."

She considers. "But you're right. If we survive this, it's a skist trade. Fine. You've convinced me with your fancy sarcasm. Let's make sure we stop the Sorrow then, yeah?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She didn't count on *you*, I'm sure of it. You're unraveling that skein of lies." She grabs your shirt and pulls you close. "She is the creator of our problems. She sent us to the Bloom's heart to be rid of us, because she knew that we'd either find Mazzof or die, and either way, she comes out ahead. So now we need to change those plans."

She releases you, steps back, and brushes the wrinkles out. "I have faith in you, kid. You and me. We're going to stop that bitch."</DefaultText>

She sighs. "But we need not argue with each other right now. Just know that I want the chance to put at least one knife in her."</DefaultText>

What if you opened another eye, and then another, and then another? What would you see then?" She laughs delightedly. "I see *possibilities*. I see *realities*. And I feel the Bloom's hunger. Now."
