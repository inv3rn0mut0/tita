      <DefaultText>This is a smooth synth basin, shaped to match the contours of a human head. Lights pulse along the inside surface accompanied by an energetic hum.

      <DefaultText>The moment the helmet touches your head, your vision tunnels and blurs. An instant later, you regain your sight in a dark, domed room. A frozen image of the beast in the nearest tank appears in the center of the chamber with the word "Nevajin" under it. 

It is a humanoid with a skull-like head attached to a bulky body by fibrous tendrils. According to these records, the head is a different being than the body.</DefaultText>

After a pause, the voice adds, "Mass-melody synchronization is necessary to make contact with the nevajin's joint minds."</DefaultText>
