      <DefaultText>The creature within this tank shudders, and bubbles obscuring its glowing eyes. Thin, flickering fibers emerge from the tank, but dissolve before they can make contact with your temples. One of the beasts has infected the nearby machine and is preventing you from making contact with the creature's mind. </DefaultText>

The sour dread in your gut recognizes them for what they are - hands of the being that hunted you while you regained your memories. Fragments of the Sorrow. 

Four of them lunge into the machines connected to the remaining tanks, wreaking chaos on their delicate innards. The fifth fragment focuses its eyeless gaze on you and your ally. </DefaultText>

Sadness billows through the creature's mind as it stares at the jagged corpse, mourning the loss of the fascinating and dangerous ancient knowledge, and wondering what drove it to such uncharacteristically rash behavior.
