      <DefaultText>At first, this tank appears to contain a dense, jumbled mass of sharp-edged onyx. It is only when a cluster of eyes flickers beneath a slick membrane that you realize you are looking upon the oily carapace of a huge insect - a nchalsik, your memory whispers - compressed into a tiny space.

      <DefaultText>The tank creaks on its bolted foundations as the monstrous black creature within spins and claws at the glass in an unconscious frenzy. It is a thrashing blur behind the white-tinged froth, and you can no more make contact with its mind than you can make out a single detail about it. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hunter's outrage melts into a calm serenity that fills her language ducts and billows from her pheromonal slits. 

She rises from her servile crouch, speaking with a mixture of scents and claw gestures. The elder's pride falters, and he focuses on the pack. He sees the unhealed rifts in their graying carapaces, their chipped claws. Tangible clouds of shame radiate from his powerful frame as he leans down to return his hunters' kills. 

You feel the Tides embrace and flow through you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Back in the strange laboratory, five hulking, smoky creatures bound onto the platform, sucking at the air with crackling snarls. The sour dread in your gut recognizes them for what they are: hands of the being that hunted you while you regained your memories. Fragments of the Sorrow. 

Four of them lunge into the machines connected to the remaining tanks, wreaking chaos on their delicate innards. The fifth fragment focuses its eyeless gaze on you and your ally. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After returning to your own body, a dull heat settles in your gut, and an oily haze crowds your vision. You sense... no, you *know* that the Sorrow has focused its dire attention directly on you. 

The remainder of the Sorrow fragments spill from the devices they were infesting, and join the hunt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your will focuses her outrage into a needlepoint of fury, and she lunges at the elder, tail uncoiling with a rattling whipcrack. 

Barbed tails carve whistling paths in the air. Claws flash and ichor sprays, turning dirt to mud. You sense sorrow rising from the pack. They will survive - they always do - but soon, an elder or a hunter will be dead. There will be no victory here. 

You feel the Tides embrace and flow through you just as the dying elder tears out your host's throat.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>The hunter pours her outrage into her language ducts, and she rises, wearing her scent like a cloak, her pheromones singing of injustice. Of starvation. Of the disastrous pride of the elder, and the slow death of the pack. 

They breathe her arguments in, *absorbing* them, and flinch, as if waking from a nightmare. Then, as one, the pack streams at the elder, and tears him to shrieking pieces. 

You feel the Tides embrace and flow through you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>The impulse to stand against the elder dies a reluctant death in the nchalsik's chest. He is the strongest warrior she has ever known, and he protects the pack from the predators at the edges of their territory. Even if one, two, or twenty nchalsik die from starvation, the pack will survive. It always has. 

Bending low, your host offers her kill to the elder with shaking claws. You feel the Tides embrace and flow through you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stoke the outrage of the hunter into a roaring bonfire of confidence, and she knows she must confront the elder herself. She's the only one who can. 

She rises, baring claws still wet with her prey's blood. Pheromones boil off her as she meets the elder's eyes. After a long moment, the elder hisses his respect. She - and the others - can keep their prey this time.
