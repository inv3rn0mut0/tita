      <DefaultText> As you step back from the pedestal, you feel new life and new breath fill your lungs - different life, different breath, more powerful.

You have saved the wisdom of the chalice.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The orb's light becomes denser, stronger, and as you hold it near the book, its beams reify, taking the shape of some of the missing pieces.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You recall that memories are like wind, like tears in the rain, and with this as your guide, you set about restoring the chalice with your breath and with your sweat. What takes shape under your hands is not perfect, but it has reversed some of the worst damage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A delicate glass chalice, clearly designed for no human hand, sits atop this pedestal. Carved of blue-green glass, with swirled protrusions at the side that you assume must be handles, though you hesitate to lift it for fear of breaking it. it has a narrow mouth like a tubular flower - you'd need a proboscis to drink from this without spilling on yourself if you left it on the pedestal.

The Sorrow's flames have not reached the chalice yet, and it has not yet begun to burn.</DefaultText>

The Sorrow's flames have reached the base of the pdestal, and you can see that the delicate glasswork is beginning to show signs of stress in this intense heat.</DefaultText>

The Sorrow's flames have begun to lick at the chalice itself, and some of its delicate glasswork has begun to bubble and run. You will have to work quickly to save it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly you realize that the fragments of the four items in the room can be cobbled together to create a single item. You can imagine the orb, book, coral, and chalice together... perhaps you can craft something from them.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>You know that you can't recreate the chalice exactly as it was, and instead you resolve to create something that can serve in the place of the chalice. When you have finished, it is not the elegant vessel you saw earlier... but the cup that you have fashioned in its place serves as well. You have saved the Chalice of Wisdom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A piece of glass slices your finger as you scoop them together, and the spilled blood dissolves the remaining pieces into a silvery mist that you inadvertently inhale. The pain of the cut resolves you to be more careful, and you realize that this is the beginning of wisdom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Leaning forward, you look carefully at this delicate glass structure. Its glass is thin and almost completely translucent. You have the strangest feeling that you need to drink from it, but it is empty, you have no liquid, and you are concerned that if you lifted it from the pedestal you would crush it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Try to understand the mindset that created the chalice. Perhaps this will help provide an answer.</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>You lean into the chalice and speak loudly and clearly. Something in your voice - or perhaps your breath alone - settles into the heart of the chalice, and you see it condensing into liquid. 

But the chalice is too delicate to pick up. How will you drink this?</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>You raise your voice, you thunder at the chalice, you issue stentorian proclamations... all to no avail. Your boastful mien does not intimidate the chalice.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is child's play to ruin this work of art. A single sweep of your hand reduces it to slivers that glitter on the pedestal, where they begin to smoke and char.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You don't know why you didn't think of this before. If you are in your own mind, then clearly you must have a glimmer of the answer. This is a metaphor, you reason, and the chalice is associated with the spirit. What is spirit but breath? You lean forward and breathe across the top of the chalice and watch as your breath condenses into a liquid.

      <DefaultText>You breathe and breathe, but you can't help but feel that you're wasting your time. Why would you have the answer? After a moment or two you give up.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first you consider what sort of race of humanoid insects would create such a thing, and for what purpose, when suddenly it comes to you: it was your own imagination. And with that, you realize that you want to fill the chalice with your own breath. You breathe across the lip, and then watch your breath condense into liquid inside the cup.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>Wrack your mind as you might, you can come up with no better answer than that the creator was insane or some sort of humanoid insect. It's very frustrating.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As your fingers close on the delicate glass, you can feel it beginning to give way under your fingers. It might not be wise to continue.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The glass shatters in your hand and reduces the chalice to slivers that glitter on the pedestal, where they begin to smoke and char. The liquid within reverts to the breath that formed it in the first place.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>The answer is simplicity itself: If the liquid was formed by breath, then you must be able to breathe it. You inhale above the lip of the chalice, and the liquid rises into your mouth.</DefaultText>
