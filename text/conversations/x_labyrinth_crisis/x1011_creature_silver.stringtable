      <DefaultText>Tiny currents coil over the hulking creature in this tank, stirring the brown and silver fur on its muscular forelimbs.

Your host and the other leader growl and snarl at each other. The only thing between them and the kilometer of open air below is a thin sheet of ice. The first grorthas to flee for safety will lose the duel, and their pack. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In defiance of his own instincts, your host springs for the cliff as the ledge crumbles, baffled shame expanding through his chest like a scalding weight.

The ledge falls away, but a second later, his rival appears beside him in a flash, grunting in satisfaction. The rival leaves, and both packs follow him over a distant hill. Tusked grorthas will not follow a leader that flees from duels, no matter the reason.

      <DefaultText>Back in the strange laboratory, five hulking, smoky creatures bound onto the platform, sucking at the air with crackling snarls. The sour dread in your gut recognizes them for what they are: hands of the being that hunted you while you regained your memories. Fragments of the Sorrow. 

Four of them lunge into the machines connected to the remaining tanks, wreaking chaos on their delicate innards. The fifth fragment focuses its eyeless gaze on you and your ally. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tusked grorthas bounds at his rival, his blood singing with the strength of your command, and impales his rival with his tusks and tosses the body over the edge.

Your host chortles to himself when suddenly the ledge snaps. He falls into the abyss after his rival, teleporting himself to the top of the cliff at the last second, both packs cheering his victory.

      <DefaultText>Unwelcome doubt stirs in your host's chest, and he grunts reluctantly at his rival, jerking his head at the watching tribes. Who will rule them if they both fall to their deaths? Surprise surfaces on the rival's face. Then, he snorts his agreement.

As the ledge crumbles, the mortal enemies teleport simultaneously to the top of the cliff. The packs are surprised but hopeful as the fight continues on solid ground.

      <DefaultText>With fluid speed, your host slams into his rival and teleports the rival to the top of the cliff against his will.

There is a sharp crack. The ledge crumbles away beneath your host's feet. As your host falls into the abyss, you sense a great confusion. It cannot figure out whether it just won the duel or lost.

      <DefaultText>The tusked grorthas bounds at his rival, howling. Their tusks lock, scraping against each other.

Suddenly, the ledge snaps, and both tusked grorthas fall into open space. Both animals huff and growl, but neither will be the one to teleport first.

At the last second, the rival's eyes open in fear and it disappears. Your host slams into the ground, too late to teleport itself. As it lies dying, you feel its immense satisfaction.
