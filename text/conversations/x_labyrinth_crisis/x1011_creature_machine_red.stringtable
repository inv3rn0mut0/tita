      <DefaultText>A hideous, fleshy *ripping* comes from behind the hatch set into the front of this machine. The sound thrums through the cables to the nearby tank where a jumble of cloudy crystal spines - the creature in the tank - claws frantically at the unyielding walls. 

Forcing the Sorrow fragment from this machine should put a stop to the incessant, nauseating clamor that's hurting the creature.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Breathing steadily, you bend each of the cables as the sickening sound streaming through them fills your veins and claws at your temples. 

Slowly, the sound grows quieterThen, at last, the noise chokes to a halt, and flows back into the machine. The frantic creature in the tank immediately melts into a calm, silvery pool of liquid. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You gather the cables into your fists and clench them shut, closing your mind to the sickening sound coming from the machine. The noise chokes to a halt, then flows back into the machine where the fragment is hiding.

      <DefaultText>You press at the edges of the dish's somewhat-malleable metal, trying to corral the crossing beams of light. Before long, the collection plate resembles a metal flower, a cage for light, in which the beams are fully trapped and focused on the dish's center.

      <DefaultText>Raking an improvisatorial eye over the crossing patterns of beams, you grip the edge of the dish, and make several minute adjustments to the somewhat-malleable metal with your thumbs. The scattered bars of light the new angles you've made, and bounce directly into the center of the dish.

      <DefaultText>After a few minutes of careful probing, you find a vibrating screw - carved to resemble a spiraling tower, complete with windows and crenellations - has come loose, and has been scraping against the surface it's supposed to be connected to. 

Holding several mechanisms in place, you tighten the screw, and - luckily - step back. A beam shoots from the *top* of the machine into the center of the tank's collection dish. The orb inside melts into a calm, silvery pool of liquid. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a small notch on one side of the hatch. It's difficult, but after much strain the hatch finally flies open, revealing an ember-veined tunnel far longer than the machine could hold. The Sorrow fragment is at the far end, taking steaming bites from the walls.

Suddenly, it *leaps*, flying up the tunnel and out with impossible speed.

The creature in the tank melts into a calm, silvery pool of liquid the moment the fragment flees. The creature should be calm enough to connect with now.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hatch trembles at the first touch, but there doesn't seem to be a way to open it. Just behind the synth panel, you hear grinding and screeching. The inky creature corrupting the machine surges out, releasing the lock. As it screams by, its wormy appendages squeeze at your nervous system.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tugging at a notch on the side of the hatch opens it immediately. Inside is a horizontal, ember-veined tunnel far longer than the machine could hold. The Sorrow fragment is at the far end, taking great, steaming bites from the walls.

Seeing the hatch open, it *leaps*, flying up the tunnel and out with impossible speed.

The creature in the tank melts into a calm, silvery pool of liquid the moment the fragment hurtles over your head. The creature should be calm enough to connect with now.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before the hatch closes, a curved metal rod resting several armlengths into the tunnel pops out onto the ground. The machine doesn't appear to need it anymore. It was some sort of data tunneler, which isn't very helpful here, but it could make for a handy single-use teleporter by crossing two exposed wires at one end.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before the hatch closes, a gleaming stronglass dome pops up from a socket just below the hinge. Grabbing it as it falls, you see brilliant energies swirl in its core. It might make a useful weapon against the Sorrow fragments.</DefaultText>
