      <DefaultText>[This machine is projecting a holographic scene on loop. Though the images mostly flash by too quickly for you to process, you observe that the final image before the loop restarts lingers just long enough to give the impression of something being considered, a moment in time being constantly re-examined.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You have been walking under the wasted sun for what feels like days - the sun does not move on the horizon, and its incessant heat has scoured the plain of life. Your water is running low, and you are seriously considering abandoning this body.

And then you see shapes shimmering on the horizon. You release an eyecatcher - it will tell you if this is a mirage or a destination.

It shoots into the sky, vanishing from sight. It returns with good news - you've discovered an oasis... of sorts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>["I am sorry, Traveller. The Guide, bringer of law and abundance, can offer you no assitance. It has imprisoned its chosen Interpreter, the only of us who can commune with its infinite wisdom, for the last two moons. I fear we have angered The Guide, that it has abandoned us, and wishes us to suffer at the cruelty of the Great Wasteland." Despite their poverty, they offer your a place to stay, and something to eat.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[As thanks for their care, you decide to solve their problem, and approach The Guide under cover of night. By dawn, you've come to understand that the numenera detained The Interpreter because he performed a mercy-killing. A woman, dying and in pain was given a heavy dose of some sleeping herb. The device, enraged at The Interpreter's violation of its laws, seems unable to exact its punishment due to a bond with its prisoner.]</DefaultText>

Overriding The Guide, allowing it to kill The Interpreter, though he harbored no ill-intent, would preserve their way of life, and you could channel the Tidal Energy into a destructive force against a Fragment. ]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You concentrate, marshalling your powers, the Tides you have been researching. You imagine them as a blade, and you hurl them against the construct's circuitry. The machine struggles, throwing up defenses against you, but it is no match for this new energy. It fizzles and dies, and you feel a wrench as time lurches back into motion.

You look at your hands. The flesh hangs loose on your suddenly-skeletal frame - a steep price to protect these villagers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You trudge onward, bitterly wishing for better boots. When at last you reach the rude collection of wattle and daub huts, primitive humans gathering around you, beseeching you in a strange tongue.

They offer you some of their precious remaining water, and you settle down to learn the basics of their language. After a day, you know enough to understand the depth of their plight: they say the Lurker in the Cave has stolen the sun's momentum. They beg for your aid.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a fitful nap, you begin the perilous climb to the cave. Inside, a long-forgotten installation houses a trapped construct. It speaks through the scree of a fallen ceiling, and it tells you that it has demanded the autochthons clear the rubble. When they refused to dig it free so that it could return to its work, it sealed the plain inside a time bubble. "They will come to reason," it concludes.

You don't have time for this. The construct's needs are paltry compared to the need for water.</DefaultText>
