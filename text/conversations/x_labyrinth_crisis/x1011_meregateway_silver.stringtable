      <DefaultText>Forged of blinding chrome, this statue depicts a monstrous woman covered in scales. Each tile of her armor flashes and gleams, forcing you to pay heed. Pinned in place by the spectacle, you see her eyeless face is screaming in triumph. In one hand, she holds a magnificent hammer high above her head. You feel overwhelmed by a desire to follow her to victory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hammer itself is nearly transparent, except for a glimmer where her hand grips the weapon. Inside the handle, a thousand - a million? - miniscule motes of light flutter, seeming to awaken at your arrival. They wait for you to lead them, to guide them. They want to admire you, cherish you, adore you, sing your story.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The motes dash momentarily away from your imperious presence before slowly, hesitantly, gliding upwards. They seem to understand that you will destroy them before you allow them to ignore you. As the twinkling sparks collect at the apex of the weapon they form into a single, solid source of light, seeming to give the hammer irresistible weight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The motes rush straight up the length of the crystal. Their movement is hungry, greedy. They believe your promises. As the twinkling sparks collect at the apex of the weapon they form into a single, solid source of light, seeming to give the hammer irresistible weight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though you cannot claim the knowledge as your own, you find the name of the depicted woman. You stand before the Great Chila the Liberator, who freed the slaves of the Bloom and led them in revolution against the cruel masters of Sagus Cliffs. Her revolt overthrew the corrupt government of that time and ushered in a new era of freedom.

      <DefaultText>The statue's arm swings down. The hammer smashes into the ground with a resounding ring and a blinding flash. As your eyes refocus, you see that the statue has been replaced by a round silver gateway. In its mirrored plating, you see the etched image of the woman. She stands atop a hill, shouting to a crowd of cowering figures.</DefaultText>
