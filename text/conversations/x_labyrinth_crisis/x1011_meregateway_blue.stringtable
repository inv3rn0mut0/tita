      <DefaultText>Before you stands a statue of a man in a long coat. You feel a prickle on your skin as the deep-set eyes seem to penetrate straight through you, sizing you up with knowing detachment. The man's left hand writes in the air, glowing letters floating in his wake. In his right hand, he holds a sapphire orb. It is perfectly smooth and polished to a mirror-like sheen. Strangely, your own form is vague and indistinct in the reflection.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The longer you look into the orb, the more saturated the hue becomes. After just a few seconds, the blue is so deep it appears more like an absence than an object; an abyss. Peering into the depths, you begin to hear chanting. The timbre and pitch of the droning tells you about the universe. The voices know all there is to know and understand all there is to understand - if only you'll listen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a brief moment, you feel you know the history of every man and woman in the Ninth World and all prior worlds. As the knowledge drains away, the statue's crystalline structure illuminates and begins to compress. The sculpture stretches and flattens, forming a round gateway. Etched in the surface is an image of the statue. Long lines of runes float near the writing hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A sliver of light gleams out of the dark depths of the orb lending you a momentary glimpse at the underpinnings of the universe, the forces that bind everything together. Your embrace with eternity is fleeting as the light disperses through the statue's crystalline structure. The sculpture stretches and flattens, forming a round gateway. Etched in the surface is an image of the statue. Rays of light beam from the orb to the man's ears and eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You deconstruct the crystalline assemblage and see its constituent parts. As you calculate how to reassemble it, the statue's unique quanta flicker with light, illuminating the molecules of its being and begins to compress. The sculpture stretches and flattens, forming a round gateway. Etched in the surface is an image of the statue. Tallies and diagrams float near the writing hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a few moments of study, you recongize the repetitions and variations in the chanting. You know what comes next and begin to vocalize along with the orb. In rhythm with your hymn, light illuminates the perfectly regular lines within the sculpture. It stretches and flattens, forming a round gateway. Etched in the surface is an image of the statue. The writing hand points into the distance and the eyes stare at a far-off point.</DefaultText>
