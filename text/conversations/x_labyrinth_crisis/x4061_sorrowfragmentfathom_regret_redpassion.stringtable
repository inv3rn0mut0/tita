      <DefaultText>[This machine is projecting a holographic scene on loop.

      <DefaultText>You're lost in the scent of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feel of her skin. You stumble against the door and fumble with the lock, unwilling to break contact with this remarkable, beautiful, wonderful woman. Even before you manage to wrestle the door open, you're already shrugging out of your clothes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once inside, the rest of your clothes disappear as if by magic. The city outside is noisy, but you can't hear the din of the market as you focus on her breath, her eyes, her body, and the day vanishes like your clothes. Eventually, hours later, night falls, and the two of you collapse onto the ruined bed.

She drifts off to sleep, whispering in your ear of what you could accomplish together.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As her contented breathing warms your chest, you reflect. You never expected Salimeri to be like this when you sought her out. You intended only to take advantage of her position and her expertise, but... she has become so much more in such a short time. She... she makes you reconsider everything you've been striving toward for all these years.

Gods, you don't remember feeling love like this for anyone since... no. No. Another memory swells, and it reminds you of your goal.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Focusing on the narrator's desire to abandon   his plans in order to stay with his lover would disassociate you from this plane, making you harder to be struck.
You could draw upon the Tidal potential contained within his potential to recommit to his work and leave his distracting partner ir order to empower your attacks.
He considers using the Tides to bend her to his will, ensuring she'll aid him above all others; you could use the potential to similarly sap the will of the fragments, weakenign their abiltiy to harm you.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>What you want in this moment can't distract you from the centuries you have spent building this life. You stroke Salimeri's hair, and the Tides trickle from you into her dreams.

You break her love for you, turning it back to the work you discussed. You refocus her mind and rebuild her affection. You don't want to lose this, but... you can't cast off your ambition. You lie in bed, waiting for her to wake, for the work to start again.

A single tear wells in your eye. You dash it away.</DefaultText>
