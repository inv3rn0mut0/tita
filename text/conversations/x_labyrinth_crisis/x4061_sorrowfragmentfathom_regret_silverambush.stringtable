      <DefaultText>[This machine is projecting a holographic scene on loop. Though the images mostly flash by too quickly for you to process, you observe that the final image before the loop restarts lingers just long enough to give the impression of something being considered, a moment in time being constantly re-examined.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you inspect this device, you feel it rifling through your mind, bringing up a blur of unbidden images. One of them in particular demands your attention, tugging insistently at a buried memory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You enter the tavern and every face turns to you. The warm susurrus of conversation trails off. They know you, and they know what you've come here for. The aldeia of Thaul supports the nearby clave, and the locals keep a chary eye on the Aeon Priests. They know the dangers of the numenera the scientists unearth, and - given their proximity to the Endless Battle - they know what your tattoo means.

You hear the sharp whisper: "Castoff scum!"

You don't give them the satisfaction of looking.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But you can feel the tension in the room as you make your way up to the bar. The tavernkeeper won't meet your eye. You know what comes next. You sigh, and turn to face the room.

A large, burly woman stands in front of you. "You're not welcome here, castoff. Your damn war is a bane. We'll have no castoffs here, not anymore. Get out, or by the gods we'll make you wish you had."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel energies building and swirling within you. Your smile is savage as you weave a net of the Tides.

"You have no idea who you're talking to. I am no castoff. I am their creator. I am the author of the Endless Battle. I am the Changing God, and you *will* revere me."

You hold your hands wide, and the Tides spill from you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Half the villagers fall to their knees, weeping as your will twists their hatred into adoration. The burly woman yanks a knife from her belt. "You'll not take my mind, monster!"

Her neighbors fall on her before she can take another step, knives flashing. Her life spills across the floor, around your feet. You step through it, trailing bloody footprints to the door, and you're not sure if the disgust you feel is for the dead woman or for yourself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[As the narrator considers Surging to slay his ambushers in one swoop, you realize you could funnel the potential energy  into a destructive wave at a Sorrow Fragment.
He alternatively considers using a Surge to loosen the drit in the area, slowing his attackers in a quagmire, until he coudl make a leisurely escape; you could harness this energy to slow your attackers..]</DefaultText>
