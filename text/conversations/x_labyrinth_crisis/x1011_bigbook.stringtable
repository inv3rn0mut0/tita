      <DefaultText>An enormous, dusty book sits atop this marble lectern. Its cover is of some strange steel, and animated scenes dance deep within its patina. A massive, carefully wrought chain holds it to the lectern... and incidentally holds the cover closed with an intricate lock.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Sorrow's strange flames have reached the marble lectern! You can see the pages of this massive, metal book beginning to singe, and a small voice in you cries out at the loss of knowledge implicit in every scorch mark, no matter how tiny. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You arrange the pieces of the four Blue objects on the table, and after a moment's careful deliberation, you use the pieecs of the other objects to sketch your impressions of the book... and as you do so, the book rebuilds itself under your fingertips. Though enormous gaps remain, you have managed to restore a a good portion of its knowledge. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Working from memories you summoned from an unused part of your mind, you somehow smooth the coral fragments into pieces of paper that creep into the book's binding. Writing rises from the surface of the pages like water welling from an underground spring. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lock is of a living metal, its configuration slithering about so that no single keyhole is ever evident in it. It looks like a serpent with no head and no tail, knotted endlessly around itself. You won't be able to pick this lock.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>Now that the lock has opened, you see the chain has detached from the base of the lectern as well. Picking it up to investigate further, the chain coils from your fingers to the top of the lectern, and something about its appearance nags at you. The outer edges of the chain resemble a serpent's scales, as if they interlock and overlap.</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>You open the cover, but the script is in a language you don't understand. Just looking at it gives you a headache. You'll need some sort of translation device. But what can you use?</DefaultText>

      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>You consider the chain briefly, and it seems an easy enough solution. You simply take the spool of chain, like so, and then wind it together like this, and the pieces interlock into place... except that when you try, the chain collapses into a tangled heap.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though the chain looks incredibly durable, you manage to scatter its pieces. Even as you destroy the chain, you notice the book crumbling, and you're too late to stop its utter destruction. All that remains are fragments.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>You scrape the glassy goo into the bowl, and it adheres to the sides, forming a perfect lens at the bottom of the chain pile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The words flow into your mind faster than you can imagine. What you read is incredible. The knowledge contained within is stunning. You read of alternate worlds, of stepping through to places where time runs differently and marvelous machines are at your command. You read legends of heroes and villains, and you come to the slow realization that these lives were not yours... but you have a memory of them nonetheless. Your mind burns as information pours into it.</DefaultText>

      <ID>84</ID>
      <DefaultText>You block out the external distractions, the pain building in your skull, and the knowledge comes to you in a dizzying burst, a gush of concentrated information. You know now why you can speak, think, and reason, though you are only a few days old: because of the patterns created in this body before you wore it. You suspect that you can call on unseen reserves of mental strength later. You have saved the Great Book of Knowledge. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You have found a way to unchain this living lock. It still squirms on the table, and it appears to be melting into some sort of thick, translucent, glassine *goop*.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>It is almost perfectly translucent, with no sign of the metal it once was. However, the material of the lectern underneath it seems to change its appearance, its small imperfections seeming almost like a script. The viscous gel slides out of your fingers frictionlessly. You can push it around, but after a while, you realize you'll need an actual container to hold the stuff. </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>128</ID>
      <DefaultText>You calm your mind, and watch the coiling lock dispassionately, After a moment, you can see that there is a small notch on an inner loop that matches with a small notch on an outer loop. When the notches near each other again, you touch the lock on those notches, and the lock falls from the book, remaining on the lectern. The chain coils off to the floor.</DefaultText>

      <ID>131</ID>
      <DefaultText>Surprisingly, though the lock is not a living creature, it responds to your touch. It gently parts, unknotting itself, and removes itself from the hasp of the book. It lies on the lectern as the chain uncoils into a spool on the ground. You step back to assess the situation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Through careful folding and manipulation, you are able to coil the scaled chain into a realistic-looking viper. When you step back from it, it comes to life and hisses angrily at you. A massive lump forms in its throat and an egg emerges from its mouth. Then it collapses back into its original form.

      <DefaultText>Through sheer effort and strength, you manage to create a long, thin tube from this scaled chain. It feels as if you may have bent some links... but you hear a strange popping, and one of the links falls off. The rest of the chain shakes itself back into a disorganized coiled pile.
