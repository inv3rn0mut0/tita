      <DefaultText>You see two pieces of coral, dredged up from the depths of the sea and placed on this plinth. Vibrant colors play across them, and a subdued flickering lights their depths. The two pieces are obviously of a single whole, though they have been split apart, and they seep a viscous fluid. The intricate whorls and organic patterns remind you of nothing so much as a brain - a brain that is cut into two pieces, that is. Perhaps if it were whole it might jog your memory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you do, you feel bursts of lightning in your mind: forgotten pathways align, shadowy memories begin to resolve and cohere. The vague, querulous sense of oblivion begins to fade, and you are certain that memories you thought lost are now accessible... if you can just find the key. You have saved the Memory Coral.</DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>You reach out to pick up the coral, but it appears to be stuck to the plinth. Your touch causes the coral to contract momentarily, a strange ink arising from its surface. The ink seems acid, and it burns your fingers lightly... but after a moment, it begins to harden into a hard glaze.</DefaultText>

      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>At your insistent touch, a wash of varicolored ink spills from the coral's pieces, and you hear an acid hiss as the ink hits the base of the coral. You pick up the coral, and as you do, its pieces knit together - its solvent also appears to be its adhesive! However, the coral is still inert - you need to find a way to activate it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It does not respond to your touch, but it does excrete a larger amount of that varicolored ink. You can hear the ink hiss as it touches the plinth. You may have loosened it, but you'll have to wait a moment before it releases its grip entirely.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You work your fingers under the base of the coral and *heave*. With a terrible ripping noise, you manage to peel the coral pieces from their display. Most of them, anyway... the bottom has torn, leaving a sizable chunk still attached to the plinth. Liquid drips from the severed pieces, and it hisses as it strikes the plinth. You see a film underneath dissolving.</DefaultText>

The two pieces are obviously of a single whole, though they have been split apart, and they seep a viscous fluid. The intricate whorls and organic patterns remind you of nothing so much as a brain - a brain that is cut into two pieces, that is. Perhaps if it were whole it might jog your memory.</DefaultText>
