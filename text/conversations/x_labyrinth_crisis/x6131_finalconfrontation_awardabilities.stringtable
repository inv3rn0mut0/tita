      <DefaultText>As you come to, you realize that was more than a memory. The ghostly woman's voice echoes the words of the vision in your mind: "See things the way you want them to be."

This fathom does not belong to the Specter alone. You rebuilt these floors once.

You can do it again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your impact with the ground sends the room spinning. A bright light scalds your eyes... sunshine? It's a vision. A small child kneels at your feet, in tears before the ruined remains of a sandcastle.

"What happened, Miika?" The words from your mouth are soft and kind.

The girl points at a boy several paces away with his back to you. You now notice the footprints - too large to be Miika's - where castle walls once stood.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a gentle finger, you wipe a tear from your daughter's cheek. "That is the nature of things. Nothing lasts forever. But we can always rebuild." Taking her hands in yours, you pile new sand where the old used to be. "Close your eyes. See things the way you want them to be, and soon they will be."

Her chest shudders with her sobs, but the corners of her lips turn up slightly as you rebuild the walls together.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[You hear bells, distantly, from the tower back in the clave. Turned towards it, you do not notice the swell rush up to you, and though the cool water feels nice rushing over you as you recline, you panic momentarily when you turn back and see the abject horror in your daughter's eyes.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[She breaks into a heavy sob, pointing at the ruined castle and makeshift banner snatched away by the receeding wave. You stifle a chuckle, and dig your fingers into the sand. "Don't cry, darling. We can rebuild it. Things change!" you tell her, as your reach your fingers into the sand, to start shaping a new wall, "It is the nature of the world. We'll make something even better together."]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>["Buh-buh-but I loved that wuh-wuh-one and now it guh-guh-gone forEVER!" You smile at your child, pulling her into a comforting embrace. "It is still with you, whenever you want it, in your mind. Close your eyes, and think about it, and it will be there." You wipe a tear from your daughter's face, her eyelids squeezed tightly shut, and you notice the edges of her mouth turn upwards ever-so-slightly.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you struggle to wake, an echo of Callistege's swims in your vision. "We will aid you as well." Her voice sounds as if it's coming from a great distance. "We are diverting a portion of our power into your mind. The glimmer won't last long, but it should be useful."

You think you hear a smile in her voice. "I told you this was the right decision."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you struggle to wake, a reflection of Callistege's face appears, trickling through the latent datasphere link. It seems almost like a recording, a playback of her existence - not her personality, but her *powers*, restored through some artifact of the interface between your mind and hers.</DefaultText>
