      <DefaultText>[This machine is projecting a holographic scene on loop. Though the images mostly flash by too quickly for you to process, you observe that the final image before the loop restarts lingers just long enough to give the impression of something being considered, a moment in time being constantly re-examined.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are watching a display cast through crystal prisms. The images and the colors are a jagged rainbow, just as they have been in every previous iteration of this machine, when they should be a single glowing picture - at least, if this device is to function as intended. You hiss through your teeth in frustration. How many years must you waste in trying to align these energies? Is this effort fruitless?

"Turn it off," you snarl. Your apprentice pays you no heed.

      <DefaultText>"A moment longer," he murmurs. "Just a moment." He is kneeling before the control panel, and he reaches in to make a slight adjustment. 

Above him, the images and the colors align. He sits back on his haunches, an enormous grin wreathing his face. "I knew it," he laughs. "I could hear it *whispering* to me. It's like... like it *wants* to be done. This is my masterpiece. Now what's the next step?" You're not sure if your castoff prodigy is talking to you or the machine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stare at the back of his head. He's undeniably gifted. In certain aspects, you have to admit, he even surpasses you. This is, after all, part of why you constructed his body the way you did. But now that he's achieved this... do you dare to let him return to the world? He knows your deepest secret now, and holds your future in his hands.

... but you feel a certain affection for him. To kill him would be poor thanks indeed. Instead, you speak.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[As the narrator considers wiping any trace of the work from his Apprentice's mind,  you realize you could use the potential energy to extinguish the fires the Fragments have spread around the area.
You believe you could also modify the flames so they would also hurt the Fragments by channeling the energy surrounding the narrator's thought that he could replace The Apparentice's dangerous knowledge with something less ruinous to his schemes.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mazzof," you whisper. He turns around, and the instant he makes eye contact the full force of your psychic power crashes through his meager defenses. You insinuate yourself into his memories and erase the details of this last year of work. It's a crude tool, a bludgeon, but you tell yourself that it's kinder than destroying him.

You almost believe it.</DefaultText>
