      <DefaultText>On closer examination, you can definitively say that this orb, sitting directly on a pedestal of bluish-white marble, is made completely of coherent light of many colors, that its shell is self-contained, and that nothing holds it together but its own internal strictures.

It looks exceedingly delicate. Even the slightest touch might break it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though singed, this orb of coherent light appears to be largely undamaged.
It looks exceedingly delicate. Even the slightest touch might break it. You think you can save most of its information, if you move carefully and quickly. The orb sits on a pedestal carved of bluish-white marble.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The strange flames of the Sorrow's anger grasp and tear at this orb made of pure light. The thread of the blue light is dying fast - you may be able to save some information, but you are not sure that you can recover it all. It looks exceedingly delicate. Even the slightest touch might break it. You think you can save most of its information, if you move carefully and quickly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you seek understanding by focusing on it more closely, the blue hue of the orb becomes more prominent. It lifts slightly from the pedestal, as if it were reacting to a subconsious desire to pick it up.

Within the orb, you can see flickering images, moving too fast to register coherently, but you can feel them settling into your memory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A strange-but-familiar sensation pervades your mind: the images do not slow, but your perception of them does. They appear to tell a story.. but a story of what, you cannot tell. The orb projects an image of you picking it up.</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>Though the orb beckons you, you resist the temptation to pick it up immediately and examine the pedestal. It's a good thing you did, too: a thin, dancing beam of lightning tethers the orb to the pedestal. A small, nearly invisible depression, about the size of your thumb, mars the otherwise perfect cylinder on which the orb rests.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>You reach to grasp the orb, and as your hand nears its surface, its lights blaze angrily and deliver a numbing shock up your arm. You stagger momentarily and the orb returns to is previous position. Now you see that there is a slim tether of pure lightning holding it to the pedestal.</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>You focus your anger on the orb, and with a carefully placed strike of your hand, succeed in dashing it into fragments. A sound like thousands of tiny voices filters up into the air, visions and disonnected thoughts momentarily filling your imagination, before they are stilled forever. Pieces of light begin to fade on the pedesal, like shattered glass fading to dream.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>You concentrate your rage and force your will into your hands, and you strike again. This time the pedestal wobbles, and the blue light of the orb briefly flickers and fades. Without the blue light to anchor the other colors, the orb falls into tiny shards, and the sense that something beautiful has vanished from the world swirls in your mind and is gone.</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>A tension that you had not even been aware of eases in your mind; the connection between the orb and the pedestal breaks and it slides smoothly through the air toward you.

The lightning band remains, twitching like a worm, and it forms itself into a ring.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Instinctively you strike the orb, and a piece of the blue light adheres to your hands. Without the blue light holding the rest of the orb together, it fragments, its pieces floating back to land on the pedestal. The orb does not reform.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>You put your hand out too quickly, and the orb does not slow. It crashes into your hand, and... it shatters. Some of the fragments sink into your hands, though they cause no pain. Your mind is filled with visions, frustratingly incomplete, yet you *know* that they are still a part of you. Perhaps you can use these incomplete visions with some other object in this room..</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Amazingly, it seems to respond to your thoughts. It pauses its forward motion, hovering in the air and bobbing erratically. Now the orb begins to deliver a series of images into your mind, but they are quick and stuttering, and you have difficulty making sense of them.

You feel the orb bucking at the edges of your control.</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>You snatch the ring of lightning, and to your surprise, you feel only a light tingle, and the ring slides smoothly over your finger. The orb ceases its forward motion, and it hovers in front of your hands. 

It flares momentarily, and a vision enters your head. It's almost... inquisitive? The string of images that follows flickers by too quickly to understand.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>You are not fast enough to reach the lightning, and as your hand slaps down on the ring, the orb crashes into you. A piece of the blue light adheres to your shoulder. Without the blue light holding the rest of the orb together, it fragments, its pieces floating back to land on the pedestal. The orb does not reform.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The images tell a story, disjointed though it may be. First is a sea of blackness, and then a single pinpoint of light flares against the blackness. Then another, and another, until the blackness has vanished in a bright sea. 

The next image is of a strange ship that crosses that sea, and on it stands a person whose face blazes with a light that outshines everything else.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>Now you see, in rapid succession, a flower unfolding, a massive and ongoing fiery explosion in a black void, and a mandala that twists back along its own lines in a multidimensional unfolding and refolding. The image withdraws, and all of this is superimposed under a great eye.

      <DefaultText>You study the orb's movements and the images it casts into your mind, and you realize that its subtle movements and its images are both synchronized. Your eyes follow the orb as your mind follows the images, you discern the pattern, and then you insert your mind into it. It's almost unconscious, what you do, but you tell yourself that this is your mind and the pattern becomes apparent.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your control fais, and the orb lurches toward you. You are unable to stop it from crashing into your cheek. With a horrendous clamor, the visions blur together in your mind...  You can remember some of them, but you have a moment of regret that you didn't wear the ring.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Now you see glyphs and runes. They hover, a strange, unintelligible alphabet. They swirl together, creating a vortex, and then coalesce into a single metal ball. The ball floats through a vast, dark hall past great machines, and each of those machines spits something into the ball, a rapid-fire communication. The metal ball expands, but at the same time, paradoxically, does not grow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The final image appears: the metal ball, wound through with creative explosions, stellar eyes, dimensional mandalas, and gifts from machines, turns into a single ball of coherent light. much like the one that you see before you now. It shows you wearing a ring of lightning and then settling into your open mouth.

      <DefaultText>The final image appears: the metal ball, wound through with creative explosions, stellar eyes, dimensional mandalas, and gifts from machines, turns into a single ball of coherent light. much like the one that you see before you now. It shows you wearing a ring of lightning... 

And then the series smudges away, leaving you with the taste of ashes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Now you see, in rapid succession, a flower unfolding, a massive and ongoing fiery explosion in a black void, and a mandala that twists back along its own lines in a multidimensional unfolding and refolding. The rest of the image is lost in flames.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Now you see glyphs and runes. They hover, a strange, unintelligible alphabet. They swirl together, creating a vortex, and then coalesce into a single metal ball. The ball floats through a vast, dark hall past great machines, and each of those machines spits something into the ball, a rapid-fire communication. The metal ball expands, but at the same time, paradoxically, does not grow.</DefaultText>
