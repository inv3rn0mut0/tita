      <DefaultText>Faint uniform stripes of amethyst and lavender run up and down the hewn form of a lithe man. The crest of his head is hairless and comes to a point in a vague suggestion of a fin. A high-colllared jacket wraps his torso and he holds his hands clasped at his waist.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A medallion of concentric circles sits on his breastbone. The rings alternate between dark violet and a dim lavender, the contrast much starker than the statue's striation. The molecules at the borders of each layer push and pull on each other and where one hue seems to overtake the other you notice small fractures form. When the other side pushes back in, the cracks heal.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your open palm slides through the stone and it gives way with a gelatinous squish. You leave a gap between light and dark with no sign that either can cross the divide. Without contact there will be no conflict.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you swirl your hand through the stone, it mixes with a viscous fluidity. After a few moments, the once distinct shades are an indistinguishable emulsion. No boundaries remain to push against. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With wrenching force, you break fragments of the medallion free. As each bit flies away, the push and pull along the borders slow, eventually stopping. Neither side has enough energy to continue the battle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You rip away several rings of one hue. As less and less remains, the other seems to grow in energy, battering at the barriers harder, more ferociously, until it finishes the job for you and completely assimilates the other.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With no small effort, you know the name of the man, grasping it from a memory that does not belong to you. Before you is Baji the Just. Long ago, he released a flood, turning verdant lands into wastes. Though he killed many, he saved more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Each ring of color begins to glow with equal intensity and the rings begin to expand. They grow large enough to cover the entire statue then stabilize into a solid round gateway. Carved into the purple stone, you see an image of the thin man pushing against a curved glass wall.</DefaultText>
