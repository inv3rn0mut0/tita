      <DefaultText>This orb sits directly on a pedestal of bluish-white marble and seems to be made completely of coherent light of many colors. Its shell appears to be self-contained, and nothing holds it together but its own internal strictures. It quakes on its pedestal, like a dog at a leash.

It looks exceedingly delicate. Even the slightest touch might break it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach to grasp the orb, and as your hand nears its surface, its lights blaze angrily and deliver a numbing shock up your arm.

      <DefaultText>You concentrate your rage and force your will into your hands, and you strike again. The pedestal wobbles, and the blue light of the orb briefly flickers and fades.

      <DefaultText>You focus your anger on the orb, and with a carefully placed strike of your hand, succeed in dashing it into fragments. A sound like thousands of tiny voices filters up into the air, visions and disonnected thoughts momentarily filling your imagination, before they are stilled forever.

      <DefaultText>As you seek understanding by focusing on it more closely, the blue hue of the orb becomes more prominent. It lifts slightly from the pedestal, as if it were reacting to a subconsious desire to pick it up.

Within the orb, you can see flickering images, moving too fast to register coherently, but you can feel them settling into your memory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A strange-but-familiar sensation pervades your mind: the images do not slow, but your perception of them does. They appear to tell a story... but a story of what, you cannot tell.

      <DefaultText>Though the orb beckons you, you resist the temptation to pick it up immediately and instead examine the pedestal. It's a good thing you did, too: a thin, dancing beam of lightning tethers the orb to the pedestal, and you're certain it would deliver a nasty shock. A small, nearly invisible depression about 2 centimeters long and wide mars the otherwise perfect cylinder on which the orb rests.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You slide your thumb into it, and a tension that you had not even been aware of eases in your mind.

      <DefaultText>You study the orb's movements and the images it casts into your mind, and you realize that its subtle movements and its images are both synchronized. Your eyes follow the orb as your mind follows the images, you discern the pattern, and then you insert your mind into it.

First is a sea of blackness, and then a single pinpoint of light flares against the blackness. Then another, and another, until the blackness has vanished in a bright sea.

      <DefaultText>Now you see glyphs and runes. They hover, a strange, unintelligible alphabet. They swirl together, creating a vortex, and then coalesce into a single metal ball. The ball floats through a vast, dark hall past great machines, and each of those machines spits something into the ball, a rapid-fire communication. The metal ball expands, but at the same time, paradoxically, does not grow.</DefaultText>

It shows you wearing a ring of lightning and then the orb settling into your open mouth.

And then the series starts again.
