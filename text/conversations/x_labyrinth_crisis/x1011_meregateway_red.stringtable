      <DefaultText>As you approach, this statue of a young man seems to leap out at you. His eyes sparkle and his mouth is open in a shout of joy. Holding an artist's palette in one hand and a thin-bladed sword in the other, every part of the man's body suggests motion. His clothes are torn and patched, an unplanned motley with pieces hanging loose. Paint drips off the palette, disappearing before it strikes the ground.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you inspect the palette more closely, you can see small splotches of riotously colored paints sliding and swerving around the board. They seem to dance and twirl, never forming a concrete image.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A gateway now stands where the statue once was, but it remains locked. You'll need to finish aligning the other 4 gateways before you can enter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Every bit of pent-up fury you feel spills out in waves of sound. The anger and confusion of your birth, of your impending death, flow into the statue and the dabs of color swimming on the palette begin to swirl more feverishly. They spin and inflate, blending with each other and finally consuming the statue in a spiral of crimson. They slowly settle into a round, red door. Scrawled into the surface is an image of the young man screaming wildly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A burst of creative passion seizes you as you spin and mold the paint into an expression of your most basic impulses. The paint squelches and extrudes between your fingers. Soon, the paints begin to move on their own, swirling maniacally.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You funnel every impulse in your body towards destruction, slamming your hands down on the palette until it snaps and clatters to the ground. The globs of paint refuse to fall, instead beginning to swirl and dance in midair. They spin and inflate, blending with each other and finally consuming the statue in a spiral of crimson. They slowly settle into a round, red door. Scrawled into the surface is an image of the young man tearing at his already-tattered clothing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Echoing, swelling sobs deepen into a torrent of tears. They are at once joyful and desperate, full of hope, fear, promise, and despair. As each drop falls onto the palette, the paints move to catch it, swallowing the salty water into themselves with an audible gulp. The tears give the pigments more mass and vitality.</DefaultText>

A child of the Nil caste, Sahi helped his lover Azva lead a revolution against their Sona masters in the name of revenge and injustice... and discovered the lure of power is the lure of corruption.</DefaultText>
