      <DefaultText>The cheering throng that spreads before you across Government Square has a voice like thunder, rolling and booming through the city. The people in it are victims, survivors... victors. And the last of their enemies kneels before you on the broad steps.

You hold your hands aloft for silence. The thunder subsides to a low murmur, and becomes a quiet, hungry *weight*. They want to see *vengeance*.

      <DefaultText>"Ogesti tel Kotu," you proclaim. "Orphan-maker. Hopesmasher."

The crowd seethes at his titles.

"Today is the day of your judgment," you roar. "Today is the day the Tabaht pay in full for the crimes against our citizens, against humanity everywhere. Today sees an end, at last, to the Tabaht!"

The crowd erupts in frenzied joy. You lean forward and whisper in his ears, "You have two choices - a quick death, or an immortality for which you sacrifice your ambition and your freedom."</DefaultText>

"Because one choice will end your subjugation. Here, now, cleanly. The other will give you immortality, but by imprisoning you in time. But consider... One day *I* might die. And on that day, you'll still be here. I am giving you a *gift*, if you can master it. A victory. But only if you can learn the deadly art of patience."

The Tabaht scowls, sensing some trick. You touch him with your mind to shove him over the edge of desire...</DefaultText>

You smile as you turn away, signaling for the machines that will enslave him to your will. Then you pause.

He was a notable foe... perhaps he deserved better than to be a permanent marker to your triumph. *You owed him the right to make his own choices*, you think. Then you remember the faces of the sickened and dying.
