      <DefaultText>Only the insulated boundaries of the tank is keeping this burning creature intact. It hovers, crackling, above a thin, boiling layer of water. The creature's flames suck hungrily at the rising steam, and scour the floor for more in vain.  One of its eyes flickers, and goes out. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An unfamiliar desire flickers into life in the wight's mind - curiosity. It kneels, sending flaming tendrils into the ashen soil, searching for something - anything - that will save its companion... and itself, if that's possible. 

And there, far below the surface, ancient creatures sleep. Without a thought, the fire wight takes their life, and restores itself and its companion. The two rise together, and set off across the plain. 

Heat envelops you, aligning you to the Tides.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Back in the strange laboratory, five hulking, smoky creatures bound onto the platform, sucking at the air with crackling snarls. The sour dread in your gut recognizes them for what they are: hands of the being that hunted you while you regained your memories. Fragments of the Sorrow. 

Four of them lunge into the machines connected to the remaining tanks, wreaking chaos on their delicate innards. The fifth fragment focuses its eyeless gaze on you and your ally. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before it can resist the unfamiliar, alien urge to survive at all costs, the fire wight rips the life from the fallen one, and devours it. New energy swells within its burning frame, but the fire wight grows cold nonetheless, watching in dismay as the wind claims the scattering ashes of its companion.

      <DefaultText>Sacrifice is required, the wight knows, but perhaps mutual survival is possible... at a cost. It coils it flaming tendrils around its opposing limb, and tears it free with a *crump*. With a thought, it reduces the arm to a column of swarming sparks, and channels them into the fallen body of its companion. 

After a moment, the other wight rises, and they continue their journey across the charred plain.

      <DefaultText>The wight kneels beside its companion, and you realize it is grateful - not to you, as it does not know you are in its mind, but at the chance to sacrifice itself for another of its kind. With a thought, it dissolves into a glorious cloud of blinding sparks, and flows into its companion. 

Moments later, the companion rises, radiant with life, and continues its journey to the distant river.
