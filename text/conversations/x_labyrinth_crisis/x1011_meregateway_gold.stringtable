      <DefaultText>A young woman in tattered rags is carved from golden glass. Strangely, her facial features are indistinct, plain, perhaps smudged. The burnished surface soothes your eyes as you look at it. The light reflecting off feels warm. The air around it is fertile, fresh. The sculpture's bare feet hover a few inches off the ground. In one hand, the woman bears a bowl full of grain. In the other rests an identical bowl that appears empty.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looking down into the vacant basin, you notice a small pool of pitch below the stone surface. Tendrils of black ichor dig through the stone, darting madly through the empty space between molecules. As it spasms in all directions, it leaves channels in the bowl eaten away. Its movement reminds you of poison and acid, of hate eating away the stone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sable fluid slides through the crystalline structure and into your fingers. As it stabs into your skin, you feel it cut tendon from bone, muscle from ligament. The more it hurts, the brighter the golden stone glows until its light hides the statue from view. As it clears, a large round gateway stands in its place. Delicately carved into the surface is an image of the young woman bleeding from numerous wounds, a placid smile on her face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You gently press your finger through the thinnest portion of the stone basin, leaving a small opening as you draw it back. The moment air from the outside world touches the fluid, it freezes in place then abruptly dashes toward freedom. As soon as it emerges, it evaporates with a soft hiss - almost the sound of relief. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You draw blood into your wrist with your thumb, summoning a few drops, and flick the blood into the channels. As the black bile consumes each drop, it stops moving, solidifies, and turns to brass with a crackle. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From the recesses of your mind, beneath what you know to be your own memories, you call forth the woman's name: Luthiya. A child of the Shue, she was driven to Ossiphagan by the rampaging Tabaht. Her mentor Ama bravely held back the invaders, and Luthiya repaid her kindness by feeding Ama to fire wights.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With each droplet that escapes, the brighter the golden stone glows until its light hides the statue from view. As it clears, a large round gateway stands in its place. Delicately carved into the surface is an image of the young woman throwing open a door.</DefaultText>
