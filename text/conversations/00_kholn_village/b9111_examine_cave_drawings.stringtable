      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>The map shifts and spins. The islands grow to take up the whole space, big enough that you think they might represent continents or even moons. Lush trees sprout from each one, and falls of water - or maybe roots - plunge off the sides. The glowing man looms large in the center like some kind of deity.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>The deity raises his hands. Out of each of the islands arises a number of smaller beings. The people vary in color and appearance, some with tails or extra arms and eyes. All of them turn to the deity and raise their hands to him, palms outward. You guess the gesture is a kind of worship.

The deity then ascends above the islands and disappears.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The scene shifts toward the smaller beings working on the islands. The clouded area with the giant, glowing deity fades and disappears.

Slowly, gradually, the scene darkens, the people hunch over as they work, until most of them become the wild animal you first touched. One by one, they cease working and wander off aimlessly, or else attack each other, like beasts.</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>One of the smaller beings, shaded in violet, remains unchanged, though all around her the others have become wild creatures. She bears a horn, giving the impression that she's some kind of herald.

The herald falls to her knees and pleads to the sky. Then she rises up to the clouds where the deity sits, but the deity ignores her. She pleads and begs, but the deity casts her back to the islands.</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>The glowing deity casts the herald down to the islands.

The herald takes up a twisted blade and goes to the wild creatures around her. As she touches each one, the creatures turn back into small beings like the herald herself - colored differently, or with more arms or fewer eyes, but definitely beings of the same sort.

The herald leads this host to the clouds where the deity waits.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a great battle, but the deity is too powerful. He flings them back to the islands with great sweeps of his hand. Some of those struck stand up, albeit slowly. Many more do not stand up at all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Smaller beings on the islands struggle to their feet. The herald goes to them, pointing at the clouds with her blade, apparently urging them to face the deity.

A green warrior with four-arms picks up his own blade and points it at the herald instead.</DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>The herald rises to the clouds, twisted blade in hand.

The deity in the clouds has his back to the herald, unprepared for this second attack. The herald, likewise, does not see the four-armed warrior who has followed her to the clouds with his own host.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There is a great battle in the clouds above the islands. The herald fights the deity. The four-armed warrior and his host attack the herald, and the deity faces them both.

One by one, the hosts of the herald and the warrior are sent crashing to the islands. None stand back up.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Problem Solving] There are two groups with four designs each. Touching a design in one group causes it to glow while "turning off" the other designs in that group. So two pictures are glowing at any given time.

It seems if you "turn on" the correct two designs, one from each group, it will unlock whatever this does.

But it looks as though that function needs to be activated somehow before it will work. Possibly deciphering the writing will help with that.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The writing shifts when you touch it. You can't understand most of it, but you figure out enough to touch the right characters. As you do, the other drawings glow brighter and move faster, as though you've set something in motion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The writing shifts when you touch it. They're instructions to activate the other pictures. You touch the right characters, and the other drawings immediately glow brighter and move faster, as though you've set something in motion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the scene plays, a humming grows within the wall and the various pictures move around in an agitated way. The activity dies down suddenly, though.
