      <DefaultText>"It's not here!" Matkina howls in frustration. "There's no way the First will believe the village isn't hiding it. Come on, we have to think of a way to stop her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Even as she's speaking, one of Tash's memories emerges, unbidden:

"I'm certain she will betray us," Colonel Ledak says. "She pretends not to care about anything or anyone, but her love for that village is stronger than any desire for revenge against our sire.

"The First still has faith in her, though. Gain her trust, Tash. Help her with whatever she needs, and if I'm right - if her intentions are treasonous to the First - turn her over to us as soon as you return."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I know how you feel about her," Ledak continues, "but if she's going to betray us, we must find out before the attack."

Ledak puts a hand on Tash's shoulder. "Think of your brothers, Tash. She'd slaughter them without a second thought to save her precious Kholn, and you along with them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She furrows her brow. "Yes. I mean, it's different, but... What are you getting at?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're asking if I would betray her. Let me ask you this, which of my two families is threatening to kill the other? These villagers have done nothing, yet the First would destroy them for a vendetta that has nothing to do with them. I think you *know* who I'd side with, *sir*."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her shoulders relax and she puts her weapon away, though her hand remains close to it. "I don't know why you didn't tell me before. So what do we do now?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The two rings spin eternally, powered by some unknown source. Energy flows in the center, except in one spot like a dark hole. It looks as though something belonged there but is now gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You have no idea why the energy would maintain it's shape even though the item has gone, but it has. Whatever used to be in there was shaped like a crescent or a horn.</DefaultText>

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>
You feel a slight tug from the energy in the rings, as though they shaped gravity itself. Whatever people created this were powerful indeed.</DefaultText>
