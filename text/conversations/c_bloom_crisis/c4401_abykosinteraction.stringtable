      <DefaultText>This weird, angular being looks familiar. You're fairly certain it's the same creature you released from the cyst in the Vast Interior.

It shows no interest in you. Instead, it seems to be hunting the scuttling maws... though you're not sure why.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You recognize this weird, angular being as an abykos. It's probably the same one you released from the cyst in the Vast Interior.

It seems to be hunting the scuttling maws. Based on what you've heard, abykoses eat transdimensional energy, so it's probably trying to devour the rifts inside the little maws.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the strange being collapses to the ground, the tension in the room drains away. Muscles in the walls relax, and throbbing veins deflate. 

For the moment, the Bloom has ceased to regard you as a threat.</DefaultText>
