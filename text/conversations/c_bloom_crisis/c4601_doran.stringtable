      <DefaultText>This tall, weathered man bars your path with a slight, confident smile. 

"I am Doran, castoff. Prophet of your father, the Changing God. Whatever you did in that cave has caught the Changing God's attention. He knows you're here now, and he has asked me to destroy your mind."

His smile broadens. "Do not resist."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Suddenly, his pupils slide out of view - not up, but sideways, as abruptly as if they've been slapped. 

"Yes," he says in the same, casual tone. "Of course. It won't be long now."

His pupils return - from the opposite side. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your father speaks to me," he says, pointing at a tiny device at the base of his skull - too small to have noticed before. "He has told me that he has need of your body, and I have learned over the years to trust what he says."

      <DefaultText>"It must be exhausting," he says, compassion in every line of his face. "It must be impossible, knowing that your every breath is borrowed. That your discoveries do not ultimately belong to you, and that your only marks on the world will be the ones he does not wipe away."

He clasps his hands. "Thankfully, we are here to take that burden from you. It is time to sleep, castoff. It is time to surrender."</DefaultText>

He pauses. "Unless... surrounded? Protecting... protecting orphans? Baby animals? Orphaned baby animals?"

      <DefaultText>You bow your head as instructed, but not before you see the device shoot off the back of Doran's head and soar across the space between you. A crimson, mechanical orifice - that must have been *inside* Doran's head - scissors open.

      <DefaultText>There is a high-pitched keening. Doran clutches the device at the back of his skull as though it were hurting him. He groans, swaying.

You are in a dark room. Screens hang at angles around you. On them, Doran shivers beneath a tattered blanket. The device on his skull grows hot - from the look on his face, painfully so.

      <DefaultText>He raises his eyebrows. "Now that *is* interesting business. Sadly, I cannot help you. We've seen nothing but pretty lights. To be honest, I think that's all there *is* to this place." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gives you a flat, disbelieving stare. Suddenly he bursts into laughter. "You're jesting! I see. No, friend. We have explored this entire area. *We* are the only sentients in this place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your 'crystalline friend' was right. One of us does have two 'thought patterns'. Your father speaks to me in my mind."

He turns his head slightly to the side, pointing at a tiny device at the base of his skull - too small to have noticed before. "He has told me that he has need of your body, and I have learned over the years to trust what he says."

A hint of sorrow touches his eyes. "It is time to return your father's property, castoff."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods, a fine line deepening between his eyebrows. 

"I was told to wait for one of his children, one bearing the Magmatic Annulet. At the time, you did not have it, so we let you pass. Imagine if we stopped the wrong castoff!"

He shakes his head with a rueful smile.
