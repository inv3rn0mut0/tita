      <DefaultText>[You wave your hands in front of the screen and the colorful glyphs move around in response. The screen seems to be gesture controlled - though several red, flashing phosphores warn of security countermeasures. If you could find your way past them, you might be able to overload the device and ensure The Memovira remains vulnerable.

Interestingly, a circle of red light ignores your movements and progresses in a spiral. That might be the timer.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Another set of lights catch your eye: blue lines that pulse in parallel. They occasionally wobble out of alignment. Your knowledge of transdimensional technology makes you wonder if these indicate the field's stability. Pull these too far apart and anyone under its affects would be gravely injured.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[You manage to break away the crystalline material. The swirling lights flicker out as the internal machinery is exposed - including a thick cable crackling with lightning. You can't disconnect the phase emitter while that energy is still flowing, so you'll need to find a way to redirect the scintillating power.
