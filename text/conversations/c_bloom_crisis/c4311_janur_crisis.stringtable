      <DefaultText>"I have uncovered the location of Ishtrinu, your homeworld. The Bloom lives in that world. You just need to go through the portal and you'll be home."

      <DefaultText>"What evidence have you of this? How do you *know*? The cortex... the cortex must verify the truth. Excuse, please." She summons one of the nearby lascars, whispers in his ear, and he hurries from the room. Janur turns back to you, her face betraying her hope. "Could it be? Is this the end of our pilgrimage?" She begins pacing, waiting for the lascar to return.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Janur returns, practically shaking with fury. Squaring her shoulders, she says, "The Cortex is gone. We have protected the chamber for centuries and now, with your arrival, it is missing."

She looks at her guards. They nod. She continues, "Return it. Now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She eyes you for a long, silent moment.

      <DefaultText>Her face is pale, and her hand trembles as she returns. A tear rolls down her cheek. "You... have done us a great service, outworlder. Your wisdom, your knowledge... they bring us Home." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When she finishes her speech the lascars line up outside the portal to the Bloom.

      <DefaultText>At last she finishes her speech. The lascars gather their belongings and line up outside the portal to the Bloom. "Outworlder, whatever lies beyond the Bloom is the place we call Home. Our service is done. Our thanks."
 
She follows her crew out the portal.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You follow her to the Cortex chamber, and she replaces the device in the great orb. She works the Cortex professionally, quizzing it in clipped, precise tones. Her eyes widen as the Cortex responds, and she looks to you in disbelief. When she finishes her session, she enters an extraction sequence and hands the Cortex to you.

You return to the main chamber.</DefaultText>
