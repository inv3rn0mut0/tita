      <DefaultText>[A giant tongue-cluster stands here, quivering and writhing in a sinuous manner. You can feel its hunger as you approach, and several of the tongues bend slightly in your direction.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Tongues lightly probe your head and upper torso, and you can feel an alien presence in your mind, sifting through your thoughts. A light tug swiftly changes into searing pain as one of your memories is forcefully extracted. As the pain subsides, you sense that the tongue-cluster's guard is down.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[The cluster writhes erratically, its tongues whipping back and forth, to and fro in frenzied motions. After a few moments, the violence of its thrashing subsides, and it remains almost still.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[The cluster initially resists, but you brush aside its defenses and grip it tightly in your mind. You sense the cluster's connection to nearby parts of the Bloom, in particular the Maw that leads further into the Heart, the corpuscular maws that keep spawning in its defense, and the cyst embedded in the wall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[At your behest the tongue-cluster fights a battle of wills with the Maw, demanding that it open. The Maw eventually wins, and cuts off the cluster's connection to the rest of the Bloom, but you can sense that the Maw has been weakened by the attempt.]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[You sense fear and reluctance on the cluster's part as you set it to unravel the cyst, but it does as you bid. Layers of thick Bloom-flesh slough away to reveal the creature you freed previously. It looks around in what might be confusion, the makes directly for the Maw leading further into the Heart.]</DefaultText>
