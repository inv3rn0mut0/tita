      <DefaultText>The tower's shaking has shaken loose a panel here. In the dark space underneath the dais, you see a patch of Bloom-flesh almost two meters in diameter. It looks like it stretches underneath the entire tower floor.

Crystal vines run across its surface like blood veins. Light pulses through them. They seem to constrict in time with each movement of the living Bloom-flesh.</DefaultText>

The Sorrow's flames, that disappeared so suddenly, are resting on the vines and smothering their glow. Could these vines have been what kept the Sorrow out?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Although made of crystal, the vines are almost certainly alive. Each time the Bloom moves - even the distant patches of Bloom-flesh creeping into the Tower - the vines squeeze the Bloom here, hurting it and forcing it to back off. It could only have been by moving extremely slowly, with infinite patience, that the Bloom could've encroached as much as it has.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The voice of the vines presses on your mind and suddenly you *understand* them. These vines are only the surface. The crystals are embedded deep, *deep* into the parts of the Bloom that surround the tower. As long as they are alive, the Bloom's influence in the tower is limited.</DefaultText>

You can also sense something that can only be described as a transdimensional odor. A kind of vapor that discourages the Bloom (and maybe other creatures) from getting too close.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Drawing strength from the Bloom itself, the extraplanar odor increases until you feel dizzy with it. You crinkle your nose, even though you're pretty sure it's not your nose that can sense it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vines pulse and squeeze the Bloom for more energy, but you don't sense any change. If you didn't know better, you'd say their presence in your mind felt apologetic.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your fingers meet an immovable force. Orange lines of energy cross each other like a cage. Now that you notice it, you can see the whisperlock in the corner, where the inner dais wall meets the Bloom-flesh.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Although made of crystal, the vine writhes like a snake. You grip it with both hands and pull with all your might. It pulls back against you. Suddenly, the crystal snaps and you fall back with half the vine thrashing in your hand. The other half is still embedded in the Bloom-flesh, pulsing and obviously alive.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There must be hundreds of these vines under the dais, and who knows how many beneath the floor. Pulling them out by hand won't work.

But deep in the gloom, in the center of the dais, the vines come together into a great mass - a sort of crystal case you didn't see before. It doesn't look easy, but if you can't *pull* the vines out, maybe you can kill them instead...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mass of cords slithers and snaps, pushing your fingers away from whatever it is they hide. Finally, you succeed in grabbing the bundle. Once you have them all, ripping them out is surprisingly easy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Beneath the cords, you see a pulsating sphere of glass. Surely this is the heart of the vines after all.

With an alien shriek, the Sorrow turns on you. Apparently, it realizes what you're trying to do and doesn't like it. Neither do the vines, as another blast of force knocks you to the wall.
