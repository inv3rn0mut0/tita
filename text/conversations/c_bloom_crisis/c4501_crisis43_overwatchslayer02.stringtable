      <DefaultText>There's a black octahedron floating in the center with various wires and connectors leading to the outer shell. Although you have no idea what the octahedron is for, or how it stays in the air like that, you're pretty sure you could disable it if you had to.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Within the sphere, you reconnect a number of wires that had fallen off. As soon as the last one touches the octahedron, it glows and rises to its place in the center of the sphere.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Being familiar with this specific device, it isn't hard for you to track the Sorrow's flames as they dance across its connectors. You isolate the flames, disconnecting the right wires at the right time, then reconnecting them after the flames disperse.  The Sorrow no longer controls this device.</DefaultText>
