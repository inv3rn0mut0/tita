      <DefaultText>This tall, lithe man has an unkempt shock of bright red hair. His skin is ashen, as if colored by the dust of old tomes. It's been a long time since he's seen a real sun. 

His smile is thin and twitching, and a demented light burns in his eyes. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look at this," he says, apparently to no one. "The echo came back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Another castoff," he says with a sneer. "Another *echo*." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The strong are those who *act*," he says, closing his eyes as if quoting from memory.  "They change the world. Break the sky with their thunder."

His eyes open, dark and disdainful. "And then there is the echo. A weak imitation of the source's fury, claiming to be more important than it is. Castoffs are echoes of *him* and deserve none of his glory."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Even your questions are echoes," he sighs, looking away. "You are an echo because you're not the source. It's simple."</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There are many castoffs. Even if you think we're weaker than our father, don't we have a large effect on the world?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Asclarian." He says the name proudly, as if you should have heard of him. "I act."

He falls silent, his eyes glittering with contempt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So, you do what Doran says?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>He chuckles. 

"It's always the same with you and your kind," he says, shaking his head. "Stumbling around in your father's footprints, clamoring to be noticed."

He folds his narrow arms. "Your father doesn't shout to be heard. He *is*, and the world bends itself around him." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes," he says, raising his eyebrows. His lips twitch again. "Certainly. An echo has power of its own. It can shake mountainsides. Create avalanches that bury villages."

He smirks at you. "It doesn't make the echo clever. An echo simply goes where it is sent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've changed my mind. I couldn't be less interested in what you think."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Likewise, echo."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The prophet Doran hears," he says, nodding at the man standing nearby. "And depending on what he hears, I act." 

He eyes you, fingers curling at his side.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No," he says sharply. "I act on his words." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That sounds an awful lot like taking orders to me."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>Let it go.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It would to you," he snarls. One of his eyes is twitching now. "You don't know what we are. We do not tumble about the world like you do, inflicting little damages or claiming to be more than we are. We listen. We decide."

He takes a long, shuddering breath, calming himself. "Then, we act. But no one tells us to do so."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyes narrow at your silence. Then, with a deep breath, he is all smiling arrogance once more. </DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I can, but I won't. The prophet Doran will decide what you are allowed to know, echo."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm looking for a circlet of dark, hyaline material. It's called the Magmatic Annulet. Have you seen it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shakes his head slowly, his eyes never leaving yours. </DefaultText>
